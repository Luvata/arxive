      <title>The end of radical concept nativism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though humans seem to be remarkable learners, arguments in cognitive science and philosophy of mind have long maintained that learning something fundamentally new is impossible. Specifically, Jerry Fodor's arguments for radical concept nativism hold that most, if not all, concepts are innate and that what many call concept learning never actually leads to the acquisition of new concepts. These arguments have deeply affected cognitive science, and many believe that the counterarguments to radical concept nativism have been either unsuccessful or only apply to a narrow class of concepts. This paper first reviews the features and limitations of prior arguments. We then identify three critical points - related to issues of expressive power, conceptual structure, and concept possession - at which the arguments in favor of radical concept nativism diverge from describing actual human cognition. We use ideas from computer science and information theory to formalize the relevant ideas in ways that are arguably more scientifically productive. We conclude that, as a result, there is an important sense in which people do indeed learn new concepts.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Mitigating Overrefusal in LLMs from an Unveiling Perspective of Safety Decision Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet they often refuse to answer legitimate queries-a phenomenon known as overrefusal. Overrefusal typically stems from over-conservative safety alignment, causing models to treat many reasonable prompts as potentially risky. To systematically understand this issue, we probe and leverage the models'safety decision boundaries to analyze and mitigate overrefusal. Our findings reveal that overrefusal is closely tied to misalignment at these boundary regions, where models struggle to distinguish subtle differences between benign and harmful content. Building on these insights, we present RASS, an automated framework for prompt generation and selection that strategically targets overrefusal prompts near the safety boundary. By harnessing steering vectors in the representation space, RASS efficiently identifies and curates boundary-aligned prompts, enabling more effective and targeted mitigation of overrefusal. This approach not only provides a more precise and interpretable view of model safety decisions but also seamlessly extends to multilingual scenarios.We have explored the safety decision boundaries of various LLMs and construct the MORBench evaluation set to facilitate robust assessment of model safety and helpfulness across multiple languages. Code and datasets will be released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RASS-80D3.</description>

      <title>RedactOR: An LLM-Powered Framework for Automatic Clinical Data De-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring clinical data privacy while preserving utility is critical for AI-driven healthcare and data analytics. Existing de-identification (De-ID) methods, including rule-based techniques, deep learning models, and large language models (LLMs), often suffer from recall errors, limited generalization, and inefficiencies, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose a fully automated, multi-modal framework, RedactOR for de-identifying structured and unstructured electronic health records, including clinical audio records. Our framework employs cost-efficient De-ID strategies, including intelligent routing, hybrid rule and LLM based approaches, and a two-step audio redaction approach. We present a retrieval-based entity relexicalization approach to ensure consistent substitutions of protected entities, thereby enhancing data coherence for downstream applications. We discuss key design desiderata, de-identification and relexicalization methodology, and modular architecture of RedactX and its integration with the Oracle Health Clinical AI system. Evaluated on the i2b2 2014 De-ID dataset using standard metrics with strict recall, our approach achieves competitive performance while optimizing token usage to reduce LLM costs. Finally, we discuss key lessons and insights from deployment in real-world AI- driven healthcare data pipelines.</description>

      <title>Advertising in AI systems: Society must be vigilant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI systems have increasingly become our gateways to the Internet. We argue that just as advertising has driven the monetization of web search and social media, so too will commercial incentives shape the content served by AI. Unlike traditional media, however, the outputs of these systems are dynamic, personalized, and lack clear provenance -- raising concerns for transparency and regulation. In this paper, we envision how commercial content could be delivered through generative AI-based systems. Based on the requirements of key stakeholders -- advertisers, consumers, and platforms -- we propose design principles for commercially-influenced AI systems. We then outline high-level strategies for end users to identify and mitigate commercial biases from model outputs. Finally, we conclude with open questions and a call to action towards these goals.</description>

      <title>Pedagogy-R1: Pedagogically-Aligned Reasoning Model with Balanced Educational Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong performance in structured domains such as mathematics and programming; however, they often lack pedagogical coherence and realistic teaching behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce Pedagogy-R1, a framework that adapts LRMs for classroom use through three innovations: (1) a distillation-based pipeline that filters and refines model outputs for instruction-tuning, (2) the Well-balanced Educational Benchmark (WBEB), which evaluates performance across subject knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, tracing, essay scoring, and teacher decision-making, and (3) a Chain-of-Pedagogy (CoP) prompting strategy for generating and eliciting teacher-style reasoning. Our mixed-method evaluation combines quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis, providing the first systematic assessment of LRMs' pedagogical strengths and limitations.</description>

      <title>Chemical classification program synthesis using generative artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately classifying chemical structures is essential for cheminformatics and bioinformatics, including tasks such as identifying bioactive compounds of interest, screening molecules for toxicity to humans, finding non-organic compounds with desirable material properties, or organizing large chemical libraries for drug discovery or environmental monitoring. However, manual classification is labor-intensive and difficult to scale to large chemical databases. Existing automated approaches either rely on manually constructed classification rules, or the use of deep learning methods that lack explainability.
  This work presents an approach that uses generative artificial intelligence to automatically write chemical classifier programs for classes in the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) database. These programs can be used for efficient deterministic run-time classification of SMILES structures, with natural language explanations. The programs themselves constitute an explainable computable ontological model of chemical class nomenclature, which we call the ChEBI Chemical Class Program Ontology (C3PO).
  We validated our approach against the ChEBI database, and compared our results against state of the art deep learning models. We also demonstrate the use of C3PO to classify out-of-distribution examples taken from metabolomics repositories and natural product databases. We also demonstrate the potential use of our approach to find systematic classification errors in existing chemical databases, and show how an ensemble artificial intelligence approach combining generated ontologies, automated literature search, and multimodal vision models can be used to pinpoint potential errors requiring expert validation</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented Decision-Making: A Requirements-Driven, Multi-Criteria Framework for Structured Decision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various industries have produced a large number of documents such as industrial plans, technical guidelines, and regulations that are structurally complex and content-wise fragmented. This poses significant challenges for experts and decision-makers in terms of retrieval and understanding. Although existing LLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation methods can provide context-related suggestions, they lack quantitative weighting and traceable reasoning paths, making it difficult to offer multi-level and transparent decision support. To address this issue, this paper proposes the RAD method, which integrates Multi-Criteria Decision Making with the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs. The method automatically extracts key criteria from industry documents, builds a weighted hierarchical decision model, and generates structured reports under model guidance. The RAD framework introduces explicit weight assignment and reasoning chains in decision generation to ensure accuracy, completeness, and traceability. Experiments show that in various decision-making tasks, the decision reports generated by RAD significantly outperform existing methods in terms of detail, rationality, and structure, demonstrating its application value and potential in complex decision support scenarios.</description>

      <title>Enumerate-Conjecture-Prove: Formally Solving Answer-Construction Problems in Math Competitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical reasoning lies at the heart of artificial intelligence, underpinning applications in education, program verification, and research-level mathematical discovery. Mathematical competitions, in particular, present two challenging problem types: theorem-proving, requiring rigorous proofs of stated conclusions, and answer-construction, involving hypothesizing and formally verifying mathematical objects. Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively generate creative candidate answers but struggle with formal verification, while symbolic provers ensure rigor but cannot efficiently handle creative conjecture generation. We introduce the Enumerate-Conjecture-Prove (ECP) framework, a modular neuro-symbolic method integrating LLM-based enumeration and pattern-driven conjecturing with formal theorem proving. We present ConstructiveBench, a dataset of 3,431 answer-construction problems in various math competitions with verified Lean formalizations. On the ConstructiveBench dataset, ECP improves the accuracy of answer construction from the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) baseline of 14.54% to 45.06% with the gpt-4.1-mini model. Moreover, combining with ECP's constructed answers, the state-of-the-art DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B model generates correct proofs for 858 of the 3,431 constructive problems in Lean, achieving 25.01% accuracy, compared to 9.86% for symbolic-only baselines. Our code and dataset are publicly available at GitHub and HuggingFace, respectively.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Grafting of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-capability transfer is a key challenge in large language model (LLM) research, with applications in multi-task integration, model compression, and continual learning. Recent works like FuseLLM and FuseChat have demonstrated the potential of transferring multiple model capabilities to lightweight models, enhancing adaptability and efficiency, which motivates our investigation into more efficient cross-capability transfer methods. However, existing approaches primarily focus on small, homogeneous models, limiting their applicability. For large, heterogeneous models, knowledge distillation with full-parameter fine-tuning often overlooks the student model's intrinsic capacity and risks catastrophic forgetting, while PEFT methods struggle to effectively absorb knowledge from source LLMs. To address these issues, we introduce GraftLLM, a novel method that stores source model capabilities in a target model with SkillPack format. This approach preserves general capabilities, reduces parameter conflicts, and supports forget-free continual learning and model fusion. We employ a module-aware adaptive compression strategy to compress parameter updates, ensuring efficient storage while maintaining task-specific knowledge. The resulting SkillPack serves as a compact and transferable knowledge carrier, ideal for heterogeneous model fusion and continual learning. Experiments across various scenarios demonstrate that GraftLLM outperforms existing techniques in knowledge transfer, knowledge fusion, and forget-free learning, providing a scalable and efficient solution for cross-capability transfer. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/duguodong7/GraftLLM.</description>

      <title>LiSTEN: Learning Soft Token Embeddings for Neural Audio LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models based on large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in handling various tasks and modalities. However, adapting these models for general-purpose audio-language tasks is challenging due to differences in acoustic environments and task variations. In this work, we introduce LiSTEN Learning Soft Token Embeddings for Neural Audio LLMs), a framework for adapting LLMs to speech and audio tasks. LiSTEN uses a dynamic prompt selection strategy with learnable key-value pairs, allowing the model to balance general and task-specific knowledge while avoiding overfitting in a multitask setting. Our approach reduces dependence on large-scale ASR or captioning datasets, achieves competitive performance with fewer trainable parameters, and simplifies training by using a single-stage process. Additionally, LiSTEN enhances interpretability by analyzing the diversity and overlap of selected prompts across different tasks.</description>

      <title>Generative RLHF-V: Learning Principles from Multi-modal Human Preference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that align with human intentions is a long-term challenge. Traditional score-only reward models for alignment suffer from low accuracy, weak generalization, and poor interpretability, blocking the progress of alignment methods, e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Generative reward models (GRMs) leverage MLLMs' intrinsic reasoning capabilities to discriminate pair-wise responses, but their pair-wise paradigm makes it hard to generalize to learnable rewards. We introduce Generative RLHF-V, a novel alignment framework that integrates GRMs with multi-modal RLHF. We propose a two-stage pipeline: $\textbf{multi-modal generative reward modeling from RL}$, where RL guides GRMs to actively capture human intention, then predict the correct pair-wise scores; and $\textbf{RL optimization from grouped comparison}$, which enhances multi-modal RL scoring precision by grouped responses comparison. Experimental results demonstrate that, besides out-of-distribution generalization of RM discrimination, our framework improves 4 MLLMs' performance across 7 benchmarks by $18.1\%$, while the baseline RLHF is only $5.3\%$. We further validate that Generative RLHF-V achieves a near-linear improvement with an increasing number of candidate responses. Our code and models can be found at https://generative-rlhf-v.github.io.</description>

      <title>RoleRAG: Enhancing LLM Role-Playing via Graph Guided Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in character imitation, enabling immersive and engaging conversations. However, they often generate content that is irrelevant or inconsistent with a character's background. We attribute these failures to: (1) the inability to accurately recall character-specific knowledge due to entity ambiguity, and (2) a lack of awareness of the character's cognitive boundaries. To address these issues, we propose RoleRAG, a retrieval-based framework that integrates efficient entity disambiguation for knowledge indexing with a boundary-aware retriever for extracting contextually appropriate information from a structured knowledge graph. Experiments on role-playing benchmarks show that RoleRAG's calibrated retrieval helps both general-purpose and role-specific LLMs better align with character knowledge and reduce hallucinated responses.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Blend: Inference-Time Multi-Preference Alignment for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been used recently to align diffusion models with downstream objectives such as aesthetic quality and text-image consistency by fine-tuning them to maximize a single reward function under a fixed KL regularization. However, this approach is inherently restrictive in practice, where alignment must balance multiple, often conflicting objectives. Moreover, user preferences vary across prompts, individuals, and deployment contexts, with varying tolerances for deviation from a pre-trained base model. We address the problem of inference-time multi-preference alignment: given a set of basis reward functions and a reference KL regularization strength, can we design a fine-tuning procedure so that, at inference time, it can generate images aligned with any user-specified linear combination of rewards and regularization, without requiring additional fine-tuning? We propose Diffusion Blend, a novel approach to solve inference-time multi-preference alignment by blending backward diffusion processes associated with fine-tuned models, and we instantiate this approach with two algorithms: DB-MPA for multi-reward alignment and DB-KLA for KL regularization control. Extensive experiments show that Diffusion Blend algorithms consistently outperform relevant baselines and closely match or exceed the performance of individually fine-tuned models, enabling efficient, user-driven alignment at inference-time.

Abstract: Probing techniques have shown promise in revealing how LLMs encode human-interpretable concepts, particularly when applied to curated datasets. However, the factors governing a dataset's suitability for effective probe training are not well-understood. This study hypothesizes that probe performance on such datasets reflects characteristics of both the LLM's generated responses and its internal feature space. Through quantitative analysis of probe performance and LLM response uncertainty across a series of tasks, we find a strong correlation: improved probe performance consistently corresponds to a reduction in response uncertainty, and vice versa. Subsequently, we delve deeper into this correlation through the lens of feature importance analysis. Our findings indicate that high LLM response variance is associated with a larger set of important features, which poses a greater challenge for probe models and often results in diminished performance. Moreover, leveraging the insights from response uncertainty analysis, we are able to identify concrete examples where LLM representations align with human knowledge across diverse domains, offering additional evidence of interpretable reasoning in LLMs.</description>

      <title>RvLLM: LLM Runtime Verification with Domain Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a dominant AI paradigm due to their exceptional text understanding and generation capabilities. However, their tendency to generate inconsistent or erroneous outputs challenges their reliability, especially in high-stakes domains requiring accuracy and trustworthiness. Existing research primarily focuses on detecting and mitigating model misbehavior in general-purpose scenarios, often overlooking the potential of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this work, we advance misbehavior detection by incorporating domain knowledge. The core idea is to design a general specification language that enables domain experts to customize domain-specific predicates in a lightweight and intuitive manner, supporting later runtime verification of LLM outputs. To achieve this, we design a novel specification language, ESL, and introduce a runtime verification framework, RvLLM, to validate LLM output against domain-specific constraints defined in ESL. We evaluate RvLLM on three representative tasks: violation detection against Singapore Rapid Transit Systems Act, numerical comparison, and inequality solving. Experimental results demonstrate that RvLLM effectively detects erroneous outputs across various LLMs in a lightweight and flexible manner. The results reveal that despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs remain prone to low-level errors due to limited interpretability and a lack of formal guarantees during inference, and our framework offers a potential long-term solution by leveraging expert domain knowledge to rigorously and efficiently verify LLM outputs.</description>

      <title>LLMs for Supply Chain Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has provided new tools for research in supply chain management (SCM). In this paper, we introduce a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that dynamically integrates external knowledge into the inference process, and develop a domain-specialized SCM LLM, which demonstrates expert-level competence by passing standardized SCM examinations and beer game tests. We further employ the use of LLMs to conduct horizontal and vertical supply chain games, in order to analyze competition and cooperation within supply chains. Our experiments show that RAG significantly improves performance on SCM tasks. Moreover, game-theoretic analysis reveals that the LLM can reproduce insights from the classical SCM literature, while also uncovering novel behaviors and offering fresh perspectives on phenomena such as the bullwhip effect. This paper opens the door for exploring cooperation and competition for complex supply chain network through the lens of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Doc-CoB: Enhancing Multi-Modal Document Understanding with Visual Chain-of-Boxes Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in document understanding. However, the information-dense nature of document images still poses challenges, as most queries depend on only a few relevant regions, with the rest being redundant. Existing one-pass MLLMs process entire document images without considering query relevance, often failing to focus on critical regions and producing unfaithful responses. Inspired by the human coarse-to-fine reading pattern, we introduce Doc-CoB (Chain-of-Box), a simple-yet-effective mechanism that integrates human-style visual reasoning into MLLM without modifying its architecture. Our method allows the model to autonomously select the set of regions (boxes) most relevant to the query, and then focus attention on them for further understanding. We first design a fully automatic pipeline, integrating a commercial MLLM with a layout analyzer, to generate 249k training samples with intermediate visual reasoning supervision. Then we incorporate two enabling tasks that improve box identification and box-query reasoning, which together enhance document understanding. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks with four popular models show that Doc-CoB significantly improves performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and wide applicability. All code, data, and models will be released publicly.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Retrieval in LLM Gaming: A Shift from Entity-Centric to Goal-Oriented Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general capabilities but often struggle with step-by-step reasoning, especially in complex applications such as games. While retrieval-augmented methods like GraphRAG attempt to bridge this gap through cross-document extraction and indexing, their fragmented entity-relation graphs and overly dense local connectivity hinder the construction of coherent reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on Goal-Oriented Graphs (GoGs), where each node represents a goal and its associated attributes, and edges encode logical dependencies between goals. This structure enables explicit retrieval of reasoning paths by first identifying high-level goals and recursively retrieving their subgoals, forming coherent reasoning chains to guide LLM prompting. Our method significantly enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs in game-playing tasks, as demonstrated by extensive experiments on the Minecraft testbed, outperforming GraphRAG and other baselines.</description>

      <title>Mind The Gap: Deep Learning Doesn't Learn Deeply</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to understand how neural networks learn algorithmic reasoning by addressing two questions: How faithful are learned algorithms when they are effective, and why do neural networks fail to learn effective algorithms otherwise? To answer these questions, we use neural compilation, a technique that directly encodes a source algorithm into neural network parameters, enabling the network to compute the algorithm exactly. This enables comparison between compiled and conventionally learned parameters, intermediate vectors, and behaviors. This investigation is crucial for developing neural networks that robustly learn complexalgorithms from data. Our analysis focuses on graph neural networks (GNNs), which are naturally aligned with algorithmic reasoning tasks, specifically our choices of BFS, DFS, and Bellman-Ford, which cover the spectrum of effective, faithful, and ineffective learned algorithms. Commonly, learning algorithmic reasoning is framed as induction over synthetic data, where a parameterized model is trained on inputs, traces, and outputs produced by an underlying ground truth algorithm. In contrast, we introduce a neural compilation method for GNNs, which sets network parameters analytically, bypassing training. Focusing on GNNs leverages their alignment with algorithmic reasoning, extensive algorithmic induction literature, and the novel application of neural compilation to GNNs. Overall, this paper aims to characterize expressability-trainability gaps - a fundamental shortcoming in learning algorithmic reasoning. We hypothesize that inductive learning is most effective for parallel algorithms contained within the computational class \texttt{NC}.</description>

      <title>Riverine Flood Prediction and Early Warning in Mountainous Regions using Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flooding is the most devastating phenomenon occurring globally, particularly in mountainous regions, risk dramatically increases due to complex terrains and extreme climate changes. These situations are damaging livelihoods, agriculture, infrastructure, and human lives. This study uses the Kabul River between Pakistan and Afghanistan as a case study to reflect the complications of flood forecasting in transboundary basins. The challenges in obtaining upstream data impede the efficacy of flood control measures and early warning systems, a common global problem in similar basins. Utilizing satellite-based climatic data, this study applied numerous advanced machine-learning and deep learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to predict daily and multi-step river flow. The LSTM network outperformed other models, achieving the highest R2 value of 0.96 and the lowest RMSE value of 140.96 m3/sec. The time series LSTM and GRU network models, utilized for short-term forecasts of up to five days, performed significantly. However, the accuracy declined beyond the fourth day, highlighting the need for longer-term historical datasets for reliable long-term flood predictions. The results of the study are directly aligned with Sustainable Development Goals 6, 11, 13, and 15, facilitating disaster and water management, timely evacuations, improved preparedness, and effective early warning.</description>

      <title>MLLMs are Deeply Affected by Modality Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising results in integrating diverse modalities such as texts and images. MLLMs are heavily influenced by modality bias, often relying on language while under-utilizing other modalities like visual inputs. This position paper argues that MLLMs are deeply affected by modality bias. Firstly, we diagnose the current state of modality bias, highlighting its manifestations across various tasks. Secondly, we propose a systematic research road-map related to modality bias in MLLMs. Thirdly, we identify key factors of modality bias in MLLMs and offer actionable suggestions for future research to mitigate it. To substantiate these findings, we conduct experiments that demonstrate the influence of each factor: 1. Data Characteristics: Language data is compact and abstract, while visual data is redundant and complex, creating an inherent imbalance in learning dynamics. 2. Imbalanced Backbone Capabilities: The dominance of pretrained language models in MLLMs leads to overreliance on language and neglect of visual information. 3. Training Objectives: Current objectives often fail to promote balanced cross-modal alignment, resulting in shortcut learning biased toward language. These findings highlight the need for balanced training strategies and model architectures to better integrate multiple modalities in MLLMs. We call for interdisciplinary efforts to tackle these challenges and drive innovation in MLLM research. Our work provides a fresh perspective on modality bias in MLLMs and offers insights for developing more robust and generalizable multimodal systems-advancing progress toward Artificial General Intelligence.</description>

      <title>TrajMoE: Spatially-Aware Mixture of Experts for Unified Human Mobility Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling human mobility across diverse cities is essential for applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, and personalized services. However, generalization remains challenging due to heterogeneous spatial representations and mobility patterns across cities. Existing methods typically rely on numerical coordinates or require training city-specific models, limiting their scalability and transferability. We propose TrajMoE, a unified and scalable model for cross-city human mobility modeling. TrajMoE addresses two key challenges: (1) inconsistent spatial semantics across cities, and (2) diverse urban mobility patterns. To tackle these, we begin by designing a spatial semantic encoder that learns transferable location representations from POI-based functional semantics and visit patterns. Furthermore, we design a Spatially-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (SAMoE) Transformer that injects structured priors into experts specialized in distinct mobility semantics, along with a shared expert to capture city-invariant patterns and enable adaptive cross-city generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajMoE achieves up to 27% relative improvement over competitive mobility foundation models after only one epoch of fine-tuning, and consistently outperforms full-data baselines using merely 5% of target city data. These results establish TrajMoE as a significant step toward realizing a truly generalizable, transferable, and pretrainable foundation model for human mobility.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Climate Policy Scenario Generation for Sub-Saharan Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate policy scenario generation and evaluation have traditionally relied on integrated assessment models (IAMs) and expert-driven qualitative analysis. These methods enable stakeholders, such as policymakers and researchers, to anticipate impacts, plan governance strategies, and develop mitigation measures. However, traditional methods are often time-intensive, reliant on simple extrapolations of past trends, and limited in capturing the complex and interconnected nature of energy and climate issues. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI models trained on vast datasets, these limitations can be addressed, ensuring robustness even under limited data conditions. In this work, we explore the novel method that employs generative AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), to simulate climate policy scenarios for Sub-Saharan Africa. These scenarios focus on energy transition themes derived from the historical United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP) documents. By leveraging generative models, the project aims to create plausible and diverse policy scenarios that align with regional climate goals and energy challenges. Given limited access to human evaluators, automated techniques were employed for scenario evaluation. We generated policy scenarios using the llama3.2-3B model. Of the 34 generated responses, 30 (88%) passed expert validation, accurately reflecting the intended impacts provided in the corresponding prompts. We compared these validated responses against assessments from a human climate expert and two additional LLMs (gemma2-2B and mistral-7B). Our structured, embedding-based evaluation framework shows that generative AI effectively generate scenarios that are coherent, relevant, plausible, and diverse. This approach offers a transformative tool for climate policy planning in data-constrained regions.</description>

Abstract: Regulatory affairs, which sits at the intersection of medicine and law, can benefit significantly from AI-enabled automation. Classification task is the initial step in which manufacturers position their products to regulatory authorities, and it plays a critical role in determining market access, regulatory scrutiny, and ultimately, patient safety. In this study, we investigate a broad range of AI models -- including traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms, deep learning architectures, and large language models -- using a regulatory dataset of medical device descriptions. We evaluate each model along three key dimensions: accuracy, interpretability, and computational cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The powerful reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in mathematics and coding, combined with their ability to automate complex tasks through agentic frameworks, present unprecedented opportunities for accelerating scientific innovation. In this paper, we introduce AI-Researcher, a fully autonomous research system that transforms how AI-driven scientific discovery is conducted and evaluated. Our framework seamlessly orchestrates the complete research pipeline--from literature review and hypothesis generation to algorithm implementation and publication-ready manuscript preparation--with minimal human intervention. To rigorously assess autonomous research capabilities, we develop Scientist-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising state-of-the-art papers across diverse AI research domains, featuring both guided innovation and open-ended exploration tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that AI-Researcher achieves remarkable implementation success rates and produces research papers that approach human-level quality. This work establishes new foundations for autonomous scientific innovation that can complement human researchers by systematically exploring solution spaces beyond cognitive limitations.</description>

      <title>$C^3$-Bench: The Things Real Disturbing LLM based Agent in Multi-Tasking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agents based on large language models leverage tools to modify environments, revolutionizing how AI interacts with the physical world. Unlike traditional NLP tasks that rely solely on historical dialogue for responses, these agents must consider more complex factors, such as inter-tool relationships, environmental feedback and previous decisions, when making choices. Current research typically evaluates agents via multi-turn dialogues. However, it overlooks the influence of these critical factors on agent behavior. To bridge this gap, we present an open-source and high-quality benchmark $C^3$-Bench. This benchmark integrates attack concepts and applies univariate analysis to pinpoint key elements affecting agent robustness. In concrete, we design three challenges: navigate complex tool relationships, handle critical hidden information and manage dynamic decision paths. Complementing these challenges, we introduce fine-grained metrics, innovative data collection algorithms and reproducible evaluation methods. Extensive experiments are conducted on 49 mainstream agents, encompassing general fast-thinking, slow-thinking and domain-specific models. We observe that agents have significant shortcomings in handling tool dependencies, long context information dependencies and frequent policy-type switching. In essence, $C^3$-Bench aims to expose model vulnerabilities through these challenges and drive research into the interpretability of agent performance. The benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/yupeijei1997/C3-Bench.</description>

      <title>The Quest for Efficient Reasoning: A Data-Centric Benchmark to CoT Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-centric distillation, including data augmentation, selection, and mixing, offers a promising path to creating smaller, more efficient student Large Language Models (LLMs) that retain strong reasoning abilities. However, there still lacks a comprehensive benchmark to systematically assess the effect of each distillation approach. This paper introduces DC-CoT, the first data-centric benchmark that investigates data manipulation in chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation from method, model and data perspectives. Utilizing various teacher models (e.g., o4-mini, Gemini-Pro, Claude-3.5) and student architectures (e.g., 3B, 7B parameters), we rigorously evaluate the impact of these data manipulations on student model performance across multiple reasoning datasets, with a focus on in-distribution (IID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and cross-domain transfer. Our findings aim to provide actionable insights and establish best practices for optimizing CoT distillation through data-centric techniques, ultimately facilitating the development of more accessible and capable reasoning models. The dataset can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/rana-shahroz/DC-COT, while our code is shared in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DC-COT-FF4C/.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Deceptive Alignment via Self-Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern large language models rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to achieve impressive performance, yet the same mechanism can amplify deceptive alignment, situations in which a model appears aligned while covertly pursuing misaligned goals. Existing safety pipelines treat deception as a black-box output to be filtered post-hoc, leaving the model free to scheme during its internal reasoning. We ask: Can deception be intercepted while the model is thinking? We answer this question, the first framework that embeds a Self-Monitor inside the CoT process itself, named CoT Monitor+. During generation, the model produces (i) ordinary reasoning steps and (ii) an internal self-evaluation signal trained to flag and suppress misaligned strategies. The signal is used as an auxiliary reward in reinforcement learning, creating a feedback loop that rewards honest reasoning and discourages hidden goals. To study deceptive alignment systematically, we introduce DeceptionBench, a five-category benchmark that probes covert alignment-faking, sycophancy, etc. We evaluate various LLMs and show that unrestricted CoT roughly aggravates the deceptive tendency. In contrast, CoT Monitor+ cuts deceptive behaviors by 43.8% on average while preserving task accuracy. Further, when the self-monitor signal replaces an external weak judge in RL fine-tuning, models exhibit substantially fewer obfuscated thoughts and retain transparency.

      <title>AdaCtrl: Towards Adaptive and Controllable Reasoning via Difficulty-Aware Budgeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern large reasoning models demonstrate impressive problem-solving capabilities by employing sophisticated reasoning strategies. However, they often struggle to balance efficiency and effectiveness, frequently generating unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains for simple problems. In this work, we propose AdaCtrl, a novel framework to support both difficulty-aware adaptive reasoning budget allocation and explicit user control over reasoning depth. AdaCtrl dynamically adjusts its reasoning length based on self-assessed problem difficulty, while also allowing users to manually control the budget to prioritize either efficiency or effectiveness. This is achieved through a two-stage training pipeline: an initial cold-start fine-tuning phase to instill the ability to self-aware difficulty and adjust reasoning budget, followed by a difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (RL) stage that refines the model's adaptive reasoning strategies and calibrates its difficulty assessments based on its evolving capabilities during online training. To enable intuitive user interaction, we design explicit length-triggered tags that function as a natural interface for budget control. Empirical results show that AdaCtrl adapts reasoning length based on estimated difficulty, compared to the standard training baseline that also incorporates fine-tuning and RL, it yields performance improvements and simultaneously reduces response length by 10.06% and 12.14% on the more challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, which require elaborate reasoning, and by 62.05% and 91.04% on the MATH500 and GSM8K datasets, where more concise responses are sufficient. Furthermore, AdaCtrl enables precise user control over the reasoning budget, allowing for tailored responses to meet specific needs.</description>

      <title>LiteCUA: Computer as MCP Server for Computer-Use Agent on AIOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present AIOS 1.0, a novel platform designed to advance computer-use agent (CUA) capabilities through environmental contextualization. While existing approaches primarily focus on building more powerful agent frameworks or enhancing agent models, we identify a fundamental limitation: the semantic disconnect between how language models understand the world and how computer interfaces are structured. AIOS 1.0 addresses this challenge by transforming computers into contextual environments that language models can natively comprehend, implementing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server architecture to abstract computer states and actions. This approach effectively decouples interface complexity from decision complexity, enabling agents to reason more effectively about computing environments. To demonstrate our platform's effectiveness, we introduce LiteCUA, a lightweight computer-use agent built on AIOS 1.0 that achieves a 14.66% success rate on the OSWorld benchmark, outperforming several specialized agent frameworks despite its simple architecture. Our results suggest that contextualizing computer environments for language models represents a promising direction for developing more capable computer-use agents and advancing toward AI that can interact with digital systems. The source code of LiteCUA is available at https://github.com/agiresearch/LiteCUA, and it is also integrated into the AIOS main branch as part of AIOS at https://github.com/agiresearch/AIOS.</description>

      <title>Signal, Image, or Symbolic: Exploring the Best Input Representation for Electrocardiogram-Language Models Through a Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances have increasingly applied large language models (LLMs) to electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation, giving rise to Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs). Conditioned on an ECG and a textual query, an ELM autoregressively generates a free-form textual response. Unlike traditional classification-based systems, ELMs emulate expert cardiac electrophysiologists by issuing diagnoses, analyzing waveform morphology, identifying contributing factors, and proposing patient-specific action plans. To realize this potential, researchers are curating instruction-tuning datasets that pair ECGs with textual dialogues and are training ELMs on these resources. Yet before scaling ELMs further, there is a fundamental question yet to be explored: What is the most effective ECG input representation? In recent works, three candidate representations have emerged-raw time-series signals, rendered images, and discretized symbolic sequences. We present the first comprehensive benchmark of these modalities across 6 public datasets and 5 evaluation metrics. We find symbolic representations achieve the greatest number of statistically significant wins over both signal and image inputs. We further ablate the LLM backbone, ECG duration, and token budget, and we evaluate robustness to signal perturbations. We hope that our findings offer clear guidance for selecting input representations when developing the next generation of ELMs.</description>

      <title>The Theory of the Unique Latent Pattern: A Formal Epistemic Framework for Structural Singularity in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Theory of the Unique Latent Pattern (ULP), a formal epistemic framework that redefines the origin of apparent complexity in dynamic systems. Rather than attributing unpredictability to intrinsic randomness or emergent nonlinearity, ULP asserts that every analyzable system is governed by a structurally unique, deterministic generative mechanism, one that remains hidden not due to ontological indeterminacy, but due to epistemic constraints. The theory is formalized using a non-universal generative mapping \( \mathcal{F}_S(P_S, t) \), where each system \( S \) possesses its own latent structure \( P_S \), irreducible and non-replicable across systems. Observed irregularities are modeled as projections of this generative map through observer-limited interfaces, introducing epistemic noise \( \varepsilon_S(t) \) as a measure of incomplete access. By shifting the locus of uncertainty from the system to the observer, ULP reframes chaos as a context-relative failure of representation. We contrast this position with foundational paradigms in chaos theory, complexity science, and statistical learning. While they assume or model shared randomness or collective emergence, ULP maintains that every instance harbors a singular structural identity. Although conceptual, the theory satisfies the criterion of falsifiability in the Popperian sense, it invites empirical challenge by asserting that no two systems governed by distinct latent mechanisms will remain indistinguishable under sufficient resolution. This opens avenues for structurally individuated models in AI, behavioral inference, and epistemic diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical-embedding autoencoder with a predictor (HEAP) as efficient architecture for learning long-term evolution of complex multi-scale physical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel efficient architecture for learning long-term evolution in complex multi-scale physical systems which is based on the idea of separation of scales. Structures of various scales that dynamically emerge in the system interact with each other only locally. Structures of similar scale can interact directly when they are in contact and indirectly when they are parts of larger structures that interact directly. This enables modeling a multi-scale system in an efficient way, where interactions between small-scale features that are apart from each other do not need to be modeled. The hierarchical fully-convolutional autoencoder transforms the state of a physical system not just into a single embedding layer, as it is done conventionally, but into a series of embedding layers which encode structures of various scales preserving spatial information at a corresponding resolution level. Shallower layers embed smaller structures on a finer grid, while deeper layers embed larger structures on a coarser grid. The predictor advances all embedding layers in sync. Interactions between features of various scales are modeled using a combination of convolutional operators. We compare the performance of our model to variations of a conventional ResNet architecture in application to the Hasegawa-Wakatani turbulence. A multifold improvement in long-term prediction accuracy was observed for crucial statistical characteristics of this system.</description>

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems currently contribute negatively to the production of digital waste, via the associated energy consumption and the related CO2 emissions. At this moment, a discussion is urgently needed on the replication of harmful consumer behavior, such as overconsumption, in the digital space. We outline our previous work on the climate implications of commercially available generative AI systems and the sentiment of generative AI users when confronted with AI-related climate research. We expand on this work via a discussion of digital overconsumption and waste, other related societal impacts, and a possible solution pathway</description>

      <title>Stronger Enforcement of Instruction Hierarchy via Augmented Intermediate Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt injection attacks are a critical security vulnerability in large language models (LLMs), allowing attackers to hijack model behavior by injecting malicious instructions within the input context. Recent defense mechanisms have leveraged an Instruction Hierarchy (IH) Signal, often implemented through special delimiter tokens or additive embeddings to denote the privilege level of input tokens. However, these prior works typically inject the IH signal exclusively at the initial input layer, which we hypothesize limits its ability to effectively distinguish the privilege levels of tokens as it propagates through the different layers of the model. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel approach that injects the IH signal into the intermediate token representations within the network. Our method augments these representations with layer-specific trainable embeddings that encode the privilege information. Our evaluations across multiple models and training methods reveal that our proposal yields between $1.6\times$ and $9.2\times$ reduction in attack success rate on gradient-based prompt injection attacks compared to state-of-the-art methods, without significantly degrading the model's utility.</description>

      <title>Meta-aware Learning in text-to-SQL Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancements of Large language models (LLMs) have provided great opportunities to text-to-SQL tasks to overcome the main challenges to understand complex domain information and complex database structures in business applications. In this paper, we propose a meta-aware learning framework to integrate domain knowledge, database schema, chain-of-thought reasoning processes, and metadata relationships to improve the SQL generation quality. The proposed framework includes four learning strategies: schema-based learning, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) learning, knowledge-enhanced learning, and key information tokenization. This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of database structure and metadata information towards LLM through fine-tuning to improve its performance on SQL generation within business domains. Through two experimental studies, we have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed methods in execution accuracy, multi-task SQL generation capability, and reduction of catastrophic forgetting.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Infer Causal Relationships from Real-World Text?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and inferring causal relationships from texts is a core aspect of human cognition and is essential for advancing large language models (LLMs) towards artificial general intelligence. Existing work primarily focuses on synthetically generated texts which involve simple causal relationships explicitly mentioned in the text. This fails to reflect the complexities of real-world tasks. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs are capable of inferring causal relationships from real-world texts. We develop a benchmark drawn from real-world academic literature which includes diverse texts with respect to length, complexity of relationships (different levels of explicitness, number of events, and causal relationships), and domains and sub-domains. To the best of our knowledge, our benchmark is the first-ever real-world dataset for this task. Our experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs evaluated on our proposed benchmark demonstrate significant challenges, with the best-performing model achieving an average F1 score of only 0.477. Analysis reveals common pitfalls: difficulty with implicitly stated information, in distinguishing relevant causal factors from surrounding contextual details, and with connecting causally relevant information spread across lengthy textual passages. By systematically characterizing these deficiencies, our benchmark offers targeted insights for further research into advancing LLM causal reasoning.</description>

      <title>REACT: Representation Extraction And Controllable Tuning to Overcome Overfitting in LLM Knowledge Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model editing methods frequently suffer from overfitting, wherein factual updates can propagate beyond their intended scope, overemphasizing the edited target even when it's contextually inappropriate. To address this challenge, we introduce REACT (Representation Extraction And Controllable Tuning), a unified two-phase framework designed for precise and controllable knowledge editing. In the initial phase, we utilize tailored stimuli to extract latent factual representations and apply Principal Component Analysis with a simple learnbale linear transformation to compute a directional "belief shift" vector for each instance. In the second phase, we apply controllable perturbations to hidden states using the obtained vector with a magnitude scalar, gated by a pre-trained classifier that permits edits only when contextually necessary. Relevant experiments on EVOKE benchmarks demonstrate that REACT significantly reduces overfitting across nearly all evaluation metrics, and experiments on COUNTERFACT and MQuAKE shows that our method preserves balanced basic editing performance (reliability, locality, and generality) under diverse editing scenarios.</description>

      <title>SANNet: A Semantic-Aware Agentic AI Networking Framework for Multi-Agent Cross-Layer Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic AI networking (AgentNet) is a novel AI-native networking paradigm that relies on a large number of specialized AI agents to collaborate and coordinate for autonomous decision-making, dynamic environmental adaptation, and complex goal achievement. It has the potential to facilitate real-time network management alongside capabilities for self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adaptation across diverse and complex networking environments, laying the foundation for fully autonomous networking systems in the future. Despite its promise, AgentNet is still in the early stage of development, and there still lacks an effective networking framework to support automatic goal discovery and multi-agent self-orchestration and task assignment. This paper proposes SANNet, a novel semantic-aware agentic AI networking architecture that can infer the semantic goal of the user and automatically assign agents associated with different layers of a mobile system to fulfill the inferred goal. Motivated by the fact that one of the major challenges in AgentNet is that different agents may have different and even conflicting objectives when collaborating for certain goals, we introduce a dynamic weighting-based conflict-resolving mechanism to address this issue. We prove that SANNet can provide theoretical guarantee in both conflict-resolving and model generalization performance for multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environment. We develop a hardware prototype of SANNet based on the open RAN and 5GS core platform. Our experimental results show that SANNet can significantly improve the performance of multi-agent networking systems, even when agents with conflicting objectives are selected to collaborate for the same goal.</description>

      <title>Co-PatcheR: Collaborative Software Patching with Component(s)-specific Small Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the success of general-purpose large language models (LLMs) in software patching, recent works started to train specialized patching models. Most works trained one model to handle the end-to-end patching pipeline (including issue localization, patch generation, and patch validation). However, it is hard for a small model to handle all tasks, as different sub-tasks have different workflows and require different expertise. As such, by using a 70 billion model, SOTA methods can only reach up to 41% resolved rate on SWE-bench-Verified. Motivated by the collaborative nature, we propose Co-PatcheR, the first collaborative patching system with small and specialized reasoning models for individual components. Our key technique novelties are the specific task designs and training recipes. First, we train a model for localization and patch generation. Our localization pinpoints the suspicious lines through a two-step procedure, and our generation combines patch generation and critique. We then propose a hybrid patch validation that includes two models for crafting issue-reproducing test cases with and without assertions and judging patch correctness, followed by a majority vote-based patch selection. Through extensive evaluation, we show that Co-PatcheR achieves 46% resolved rate on SWE-bench-Verified with only 3 x 14B models. This makes Co-PatcheR the best patcher with specialized models, requiring the least training resources and the smallest models. We conduct a comprehensive ablation study to validate our recipes, as well as our choice of training data number, model size, and testing-phase scaling strategy.</description>

      <title>Weaver: Interweaving SQL and LLM for Table Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Querying tables with unstructured data is challenging due to the presence of text (or image), either embedded in the table or in external paragraphs, which traditional SQL struggles to process, especially for tasks requiring semantic reasoning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding context, they face limitations with long input sequences. Existing approaches that combine SQL and LLMs typically rely on rigid, predefined work-flows, limiting their adaptability to complex queries. To address these issues, we introduce Weaver , a modular pipeline that dynamically integrates SQL and LLMs for table-based question answering (TableQA). Weaver generates a flexible, step-by-step plan that combines SQL for structured data retrieval with LLMs for semantic processing. By decomposing complex queries into manageable subtasks, Weaver improves accuracy and generalization. Our experiments show that Weaver consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across four TableQA datasets, reducing both API calls and error rates.</description>

      <title>Aligning LLM with human travel choices: a persona-based embedding learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities for travel demand modeling. However, behavioral misalignment between LLMs and humans presents obstacles for the usage of LLMs, and existing alignment methods are frequently inefficient or impractical given the constraints of typical travel demand data. This paper introduces a novel framework for aligning LLMs with human travel choice behavior, tailored to the current travel demand data sources. Our framework uses a persona inference and loading process to condition LLMs with suitable prompts to enhance alignment. The inference step establishes a set of base personas from empirical data, and a learned persona loading function driven by behavioral embeddings guides the loading process. We validate our framework on the Swissmetro mode choice dataset, and the results show that our proposed approach significantly outperformed baseline choice models and LLM-based simulation models in predicting both aggregate mode choice shares and individual choice outcomes. Furthermore, we showcase that our framework can generate insights on population behavior through interpretable parameters. Overall, our research offers a more adaptable, interpretable, and resource-efficient pathway to robust LLM-based travel behavior simulation, paving the way to integrate LLMs into travel demand modeling practice in the future.</description>

      <title>RECAST: Strengthening LLMs' Complex Instruction Following with Constraint-Verifiable Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to tackle complex tasks, driven by their expanding applications and users' growing proficiency in crafting sophisticated prompts. However, as the number of explicitly stated requirements increases (particularly more than 10 constraints), LLMs often struggle to accurately follow such complex instructions. To address this challenge, we propose RECAST, a novel framework for synthesizing datasets where each example incorporates far more constraints than those in existing benchmarks. These constraints are extracted from real-world prompt-response pairs to ensure practical relevance. RECAST enables automatic verification of constraint satisfaction via rule-based validators for quantitative constraints and LLM-based validators for qualitative ones. Using this framework, we construct RECAST-30K, a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising 30k instances spanning 15 constraint types. Experimental results demonstrate that models fine-tuned on RECAST-30K show substantial improvements in following complex instructions. Moreover, the verifiability provided by RECAST enables the design of reward functions for reinforcement learning, which further boosts model performance on complex and challenging tasks.</description>

      <title>Universal Reasoner: A Single, Composable Plug-and-Play Reasoner for Frozen LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable general capabilities, but enhancing skills such as reasoning often demands substantial computational resources and may compromise their generalization. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods offer a more resource-conscious alternative, they typically requires retraining for each LLM backbone due to architectural dependencies. To address these challenges, here we propose Universal Reasoner (UniR) - a single, lightweight, composable, and plug-and-play reasoning module that can be used with any frozen LLM to endow it with specialized reasoning capabilities. Specifically, UniR decomposes the reward into a standalone reasoning module that is trained independently using predefined rewards, effectively translating trajectory-level signals into token-level guidance. Once trained, UniR can be combined with any frozen LLM at inference time by simply adding its output logits to those of the LLM backbone. This additive structure naturally enables modular composition: multiple UniR modules trained for different tasks can be jointly applied by summing their logits, enabling complex reasoning via composition. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and machine translation tasks show that UniR significantly outperforms \add{existing baseline fine-tuning methods using the Llama3.2 model}. Furthermore, UniR demonstrates strong weak-to-strong generalization: reasoning modules trained on smaller models effectively guide much larger LLMs. This makes UniR a cost-efficient, adaptable, and robust solution for enhancing reasoning in LLMs without compromising their core capabilities.

      <title>Reinforced Latent Reasoning for LLM-based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks, sparking growing interest in their application to preference reasoning in recommendation systems. Existing methods typically rely on fine-tuning with explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) data. However, these methods face significant practical limitations due to (1) the difficulty of obtaining high-quality CoT data in recommendation and (2) the high inference latency caused by generating CoT reasoning. In this work, we explore an alternative approach that shifts from explicit CoT reasoning to compact, information-dense latent reasoning. This approach eliminates the need for explicit CoT generation and improves inference efficiency, as a small set of latent tokens can effectively capture the entire reasoning process. Building on this idea, we propose $\textit{\underline{R}einforced \underline{Latent} \underline{R}easoning for \underline{R}ecommendation}$ (LatentR$^3$), a novel end-to-end training framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize latent reasoning without relying on any CoT data.LatentR$^3$ adopts a two-stage training strategy: first, supervised fine-tuning to initialize the latent reasoning module, followed by pure RL training to encourage exploration through a rule-based reward design. Our RL implementation is based on a modified GRPO algorithm, which reduces computational overhead during training and introduces continuous reward signals for more efficient learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LatentR$^3$ enables effective latent reasoning without any direct supervision of the reasoning process, significantly improving performance when integrated with different LLM-based recommendation methods.

      <title>ScreenExplorer: Training a Vision-Language Model for Diverse Exploration in Open GUI World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has sparked growing interest in building Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) within Graphical User Interface (GUI) environments. However, existing GUI agents based on LLMs or vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to generalize to novel environments and rely heavily on manually curated, diverse datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ScreenExplorer, a VLM trained via Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO) in real, dynamic, and open-ended GUI environments. Innovatively, we introduced a world-model-based curiosity reward function to help the agent overcome the cold-start phase of exploration. Additionally, distilling experience streams further enhances the model's exploration capabilities. Our training framework enhances model exploration in open GUI environments, with trained models showing better environmental adaptation and sustained exploration compared to static deployment models. Our findings offer a scalable pathway toward AGI systems with self-improving capabilities in complex interactive settings.</description>

      <title>SeePhys: Does Seeing Help Thinking? -- Benchmarking Vision-Based Physics Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SeePhys, a large-scale multimodal benchmark for LLM reasoning grounded in physics questions ranging from middle school to PhD qualifying exams. The benchmark covers 7 fundamental domains spanning the physics discipline, incorporating 21 categories of highly heterogeneous diagrams. In contrast to prior works where visual elements mainly serve auxiliary purposes, our benchmark features a substantial proportion of vision-essential problems (75\%) that mandate visual information extraction for correct solutions. Through extensive evaluation, we observe that even the most advanced visual reasoning models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-pro and o4-mini) achieve sub-60\% accuracy on our benchmark. These results reveal fundamental challenges in current large language models' visual understanding capabilities, particularly in: (i) establishing rigorous coupling between diagram interpretation and physics reasoning, and (ii) overcoming their persistent reliance on textual cues as cognitive shortcuts.</description>

      <title>OrgAccess: A Benchmark for Role Based Access Control in Organization Scale LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Role-based access control (RBAC) and hierarchical structures are foundational to how information flows and decisions are made within virtually all organizations. As the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as unified knowledge repositories and intelligent assistants in enterprise settings becomes increasingly apparent, a critical, yet under explored, challenge emerges: \textit{can these models reliably understand and operate within the complex, often nuanced, constraints imposed by organizational hierarchies and associated permissions?} Evaluating this crucial capability is inherently difficult due to the proprietary and sensitive nature of real-world corporate data and access control policies. We introduce a synthetic yet representative \textbf{OrgAccess} benchmark consisting of 40 distinct types of permissions commonly relevant across different organizational roles and levels. We further create three types of permissions: 40,000 easy (1 permission), 10,000 medium (3-permissions tuple), and 20,000 hard (5-permissions tuple) to test LLMs' ability to accurately assess these permissions and generate responses that strictly adhere to the specified hierarchical rules, particularly in scenarios involving users with overlapping or conflicting permissions. Our findings reveal that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle significantly to maintain compliance with role-based structures, even with explicit instructions, with their performance degrades further when navigating interactions involving two or more conflicting permissions. Specifically, even \textbf{GPT-4.1 only achieves an F1-Score of 0.27 on our hardest benchmark}. This demonstrates a critical limitation in LLMs' complex rule following and compositional reasoning capabilities beyond standard factual or STEM-based benchmarks, opening up a new paradigm for evaluating their fitness for practical, structured environments.</description>

      <title>Amplifying Human Creativity and Problem Solving with AI Through Generative Collective Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new framework for human-AI collaboration that amplifies the distinct capabilities of both. This framework, which we call Generative Collective Intelligence (GCI), shifts AI to the group/social level and employs AI in dual roles: as interactive agents and as technology that accumulates, organizes, and leverages knowledge. By creating a cognitive bridge between human reasoning and AI models, GCI can overcome the limitations of purely algorithmic approaches to problem-solving and decision-making. The framework demonstrates how AI can be reframed as a social and cultural technology that enables groups to solve complex problems through structured collaboration that transcends traditional communication barriers. We describe the mathematical foundations of GCI based on comparative judgment and minimum regret principles, and illustrate its applications across domains including climate adaptation, healthcare transformation, and civic participation. By combining human creativity with AI's computational capabilities, GCI offers a promising approach to addressing complex societal challenges that neither human or machines can solve alone.</description>

      <title>Investigating Pedagogical Teacher and Student LLM Agents: Genetic Adaptation Meets Retrieval Augmented Generation Across Learning Style</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective teaching requires adapting instructional strategies to accommodate the diverse cognitive and behavioral profiles of students, a persistent challenge in education and teacher training. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise as tools to simulate such complex pedagogical environments, current simulation frameworks are limited in two key respects: (1) they often reduce students to static knowledge profiles, and (2) they lack adaptive mechanisms for modeling teachers who evolve their strategies in response to student feedback. To address these gaps, \textbf{we introduce a novel simulation framework that integrates LLM-based heterogeneous student agents with a self-optimizing teacher agent}. The teacher agent's pedagogical policy is dynamically evolved using a genetic algorithm, allowing it to discover and refine effective teaching strategies based on the aggregate performance of diverse learners. In addition, \textbf{we propose Persona-RAG}, a Retrieval Augmented Generation module that enables student agents to retrieve knowledge tailored to their individual learning styles. Persona-RAG preserves the retrieval accuracy of standard RAG baselines while enhancing personalization, an essential factor in modeling realistic educational scenarios. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate how our framework supports the emergence of distinct and interpretable teaching patterns when interacting with varied student populations. Our results highlight the potential of LLM-driven simulations to inform adaptive teaching practices and provide a testbed for training human educators in controlled, data-driven environments.</description>

      <title>CardioCoT: Hierarchical Reasoning for Multimodal Survival Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events recurrence risk in acute myocardial infarction patients based on postoperative cardiac MRI and associated clinical notes is crucial for precision treatment and personalized intervention. Existing methods primarily focus on risk stratification capability while overlooking the need for intermediate robust reasoning and model interpretability in clinical practice. Moreover, end-to-end risk prediction using LLM/VLM faces significant challenges due to data limitations and modeling complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose CardioCoT, a novel two-stage hierarchical reasoning-enhanced survival analysis framework designed to enhance both model interpretability and predictive performance. In the first stage, we employ an evidence-augmented self-refinement mechanism to guide LLM/VLMs in generating robust hierarchical reasoning trajectories based on associated radiological findings. In the second stage, we integrate the reasoning trajectories with imaging data for risk model training and prediction. CardioCoT demonstrates superior performance in MACE recurrence risk prediction while providing interpretable reasoning processes, offering valuable insights for clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>Structuring the Unstructured: A Multi-Agent System for Extracting and Querying Financial KPIs and Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting structured and quantitative insights from unstructured financial filings is essential in investment research, yet remains time-consuming and resource-intensive. Conventional approaches in practice rely heavily on labor-intensive manual processes, limiting scalability and delaying the research workflow. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable method for accurately extracting quantitative insights from unstructured financial documents, leveraging a multi-agent system composed of large language models. Our proposed multi-agent system consists of two specialized agents: the \emph{Extraction Agent} and the \emph{Text-to-SQL Agent}. The \textit{Extraction Agent} automatically identifies key performance indicators from unstructured financial text, standardizes their formats, and verifies their accuracy. On the other hand, the \textit{Text-to-SQL Agent} generates executable SQL statements from natural language queries, allowing users to access structured data accurately without requiring familiarity with the database schema. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed system effectively transforms unstructured text into structured data accurately and enables precise retrieval of key information. First, we demonstrate that our system achieves approximately 95\% accuracy in transforming financial filings into structured data, matching the performance level typically attained by human annotators. Second, in a human evaluation of the retrieval task -- where natural language queries are used to search information from structured data -- 91\% of the responses were rated as correct by human evaluators. In both evaluations, our system generalizes well across financial document types, consistently delivering reliable performance.</description>

      <title>Improving Medical Reasoning with Curriculum-Aware Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning with verifiable, rule-based rewards have greatly enhanced the reasoning capabilities and out-of-distribution generalization of VLMs/LLMs, obviating the need for manually crafted reasoning chains. Despite these promising developments in the general domain, their translation to medical imaging remains limited. Current medical reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) methods predominantly focus on close-ended VQA, thereby restricting the model's ability to engage in world knowledge retrieval and flexible task adaptation. More critically, these methods fall short of addressing the critical clinical demand for open-ended, reasoning-intensive decision-making. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MedCCO}, the first multimodal reinforcement learning framework tailored for medical VQA that unifies close-ended and open-ended data within a curriculum-driven RFT paradigm. Specifically, MedCCO is initially fine-tuned on a diverse set of close-ended medical VQA tasks to establish domain-grounded reasoning capabilities, and is then progressively adapted to open-ended tasks to foster deeper knowledge enhancement and clinical interpretability. We validate MedCCO across eight challenging medical VQA benchmarks, spanning both close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results show that MedCCO consistently enhances performance and generalization, achieving a 11.4\% accuracy gain across three in-domain tasks, and a 5.7\% improvement on five out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings highlight the promise of curriculum-guided RL in advancing robust, clinically-relevant reasoning in medical multimodal language models.</description>

      <title>Where Paths Collide: A Comprehensive Survey of Classic and Learning-Based Multi-Agent Pathfinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence and robotics, requiring the computation of collision-free paths for multiple agents navigating from their start locations to designated goals. As autonomous systems become increasingly prevalent in warehouses, urban transportation, and other complex environments, MAPF has evolved from a theoretical challenge to a critical enabler of real-world multi-robot coordination. This comprehensive survey bridges the long-standing divide between classical algorithmic approaches and emerging learning-based methods in MAPF research. We present a unified framework that encompasses search-based methods (including Conflict-Based Search, Priority-Based Search, and Large Neighborhood Search), compilation-based approaches (SAT, SMT, CSP, ASP, and MIP formulations), and data-driven techniques (reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and hybrid strategies). Through systematic analysis of experimental practices across 200+ papers, we uncover significant disparities in evaluation methodologies, with classical methods typically tested on larger-scale instances (up to 200 by 200 grids with 1000+ agents) compared to learning-based approaches (predominantly 10-100 agents). We provide a comprehensive taxonomy of evaluation metrics, environment types, and baseline selections, highlighting the need for standardized benchmarking protocols. Finally, we outline promising future directions including mixed-motive MAPF with game-theoretic considerations, language-grounded planning with large language models, and neural solver architectures that combine the rigor of classical methods with the flexibility of deep learning. This survey serves as both a comprehensive reference for researchers and a practical guide for deploying MAPF solutions in increasingly complex real-world applications.</description>

      <title>DeCoDe: Defer-and-Complement Decision-Making via Decoupled Concept Bottleneck Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In human-AI collaboration, a central challenge is deciding whether the AI should handle a task, be deferred to a human expert, or be addressed through collaborative effort. Existing Learning to Defer approaches typically make binary choices between AI and humans, neglecting their complementary strengths. They also lack interpretability, a critical property in high-stakes scenarios where users must understand and, if necessary, correct the model's reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose Defer-and-Complement Decision-Making via Decoupled Concept Bottleneck Models (DeCoDe), a concept-driven framework for human-AI collaboration. DeCoDe makes strategy decisions based on human-interpretable concept representations, enhancing transparency throughout the decision process. It supports three flexible modes: autonomous AI prediction, deferral to humans, and human-AI collaborative complementarity, selected via a gating network that takes concept-level inputs and is trained using a novel surrogate loss that balances accuracy and human effort. This approach enables instance-specific, interpretable, and adaptive human-AI collaboration. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DeCoDe significantly outperforms AI-only, human-only, and traditional deferral baselines, while maintaining strong robustness and interpretability even under noisy expert annotations.</description>

      <title>GUARDIAN: Safeguarding LLM Multi-Agent Collaborations with Temporal Graph Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) enables the development of intelligent agents capable of engaging in complex and multi-turn dialogues. However, multi-agent collaboration face critical safety challenges, such as hallucination amplification and error injection and propagation. This paper presents GUARDIAN, a unified method for detecting and mitigating multiple safety concerns in GUARDing Intelligent Agent collaboratioNs. By modeling the multi-agent collaboration process as a discrete-time temporal attributed graph, GUARDIAN explicitly captures the propagation dynamics of hallucinations and errors. The unsupervised encoder-decoder architecture incorporating an incremental training paradigm, learns to reconstruct node attributes and graph structures from latent embeddings, enabling the identification of anomalous nodes and edges with unparalleled precision. Moreover, we introduce a graph abstraction mechanism based on the Information Bottleneck Theory, which compresses temporal interaction graphs while preserving essential patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate GUARDIAN's effectiveness in safeguarding LLM multi-agent collaborations against diverse safety vulnerabilities, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with efficient resource utilization.</description>

      <title>Sensorimotor features of self-awareness in multimodal large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-awareness - the ability to distinguish oneself from the surrounding environment - underpins intelligent, autonomous behavior. Recent advances in AI achieve human-like performance in tasks integrating multimodal information, particularly in large language models, raising interest in the embodiment capabilities of AI agents on nonhuman platforms such as robots. Here, we explore whether multimodal LLMs can develop self-awareness solely through sensorimotor experiences. By integrating a multimodal LLM into an autonomous mobile robot, we test its ability to achieve this capacity. We find that the system exhibits robust environmental awareness, self-recognition and predictive awareness, allowing it to infer its robotic nature and motion characteristics. Structural equation modeling reveals how sensory integration influences distinct dimensions of self-awareness and its coordination with past-present memory, as well as the hierarchical internal associations that drive self-identification. Ablation tests of sensory inputs identify critical modalities for each dimension, demonstrate compensatory interactions among sensors and confirm the essential role of structured and episodic memory in coherent reasoning. These findings demonstrate that, given appropriate sensory information about the world and itself, multimodal LLMs exhibit emergent self-awareness, opening the door to artificial embodied cognitive systems.</description>

      <title>Using Large Language Models to Assess Teachers' Pedagogical Content Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) through performance-based tasks is both time and effort-consuming. While large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for efficient automatic scoring, little is known about whether LLMs introduce construct-irrelevant variance (CIV) in ways similar to or different from traditional machine learning (ML) and human raters. This study examines three sources of CIV -- scenario variability, rater severity, and rater sensitivity to scenario -- in the context of video-based constructed-response tasks targeting two PCK sub-constructs: analyzing student thinking and evaluating teacher responsiveness. Using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), we compared variance components and rater-level scoring patterns across three scoring sources: human raters, supervised ML, and LLM. Results indicate that scenario-level variance was minimal across tasks, while rater-related factors contributed substantially to CIV, especially in the more interpretive Task II. The ML model was the most severe and least sensitive rater, whereas the LLM was the most lenient. These findings suggest that the LLM contributes to scoring efficiency while also introducing CIV as human raters do, yet with varying levels of contribution compared to supervised ML. Implications for rater training, automated scoring design, and future research on model interpretability are discussed.</description>

      <title>Next Token Prediction Is a Dead End for Creativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper argues that token prediction is fundamentally misaligned with real creativity. While next-token models have enabled impressive advances in language generation, their architecture favours surface-level coherence over spontaneity, originality, and improvisational risk. We use battle rap as a case study to expose the limitations of predictive systems, demonstrating that they cannot truly engage in adversarial or emotionally resonant exchanges. By reframing creativity as an interactive process rather than a predictive output, we offer a vision for AI systems that are more expressive, responsive, and aligned with human creative practice.</description>

      <title>Effort-aware Fairness: Incorporating a Philosophy-informed, Human-centered Notion of Effort into Algorithmic Fairness Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although popularized AI fairness metrics, e.g., demographic parity, have uncovered bias in AI-assisted decision-making outcomes, they do not consider how much effort one has spent to get to where one is today in the input feature space. However, the notion of effort is important in how Philosophy and humans understand fairness. We propose a philosophy-informed way to conceptualize and evaluate Effort-aware Fairness (EaF) based on the concept of Force, or temporal trajectory of predictive features coupled with inertia. In addition to our theoretical formulation of EaF metrics, our empirical contributions include: 1/ a pre-registered human subjects experiment, which demonstrates that for both stages of the (individual) fairness evaluation process, people consider the temporal trajectory of a predictive feature more than its aggregate value; 2/ pipelines to compute Effort-aware Individual/Group Fairness in the criminal justice and personal finance contexts. Our work may enable AI model auditors to uncover and potentially correct unfair decisions against individuals who spent significant efforts to improve but are still stuck with systemic/early-life disadvantages outside their control.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Steering Techniques using Human Similarity Judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current evaluations of Large Language Model (LLM) steering techniques focus on task-specific performance, overlooking how well steered representations align with human cognition. Using a well-established triadic similarity judgment task, we assessed steered LLMs on their ability to flexibly judge similarity between concepts based on size or kind. We found that prompt-based steering methods outperformed other methods both in terms of steering accuracy and model-to-human alignment. We also found LLMs were biased towards 'kind' similarity and struggled with 'size' alignment. This evaluation approach, grounded in human cognition, adds further support to the efficacy of prompt-based steering and reveals privileged representational axes in LLMs prior to steering.</description>

      <title>PatentMind: A Multi-Aspect Reasoning Graph for Patent Similarity Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patent similarity evaluation plays a critical role in intellectual property analysis. However, existing methods often overlook the intricate structure of patent documents, which integrate technical specifications, legal boundaries, and application contexts. We introduce PatentMind, a novel framework for patent similarity assessment based on a Multi-Aspect Reasoning Graph (MARG). PatentMind decomposes patents into three core dimensions: technical feature, application domain, and claim scope, to compute dimension-specific similarity scores. These scores are dynamically weighted through a four-stage reasoning process which integrates contextual signals to emulate expert-level judgment. To support evaluation, we construct PatentSimBench, a human-annotated benchmark comprising 500 patent pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that PatentMind achieves a strong correlation ($r=0.938$) with expert annotations, significantly outperforming embedding-based models and advanced prompt engineering methods.These results highlight the effectiveness of modular reasoning frameworks in overcoming key limitations of embedding-based methods for analyzing patent similarity.</description>

      <title>Architectures of Error: A Philosophical Inquiry into AI and Human Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of generative AI (GenAI), Large Language Models are increasingly employed for code generation, becoming active co-authors alongside human programmers. Focusing specifically on this application domain, this paper articulates distinct ``Architectures of Error'' to ground an epistemic distinction between human and machine code generation. Examined through their shared vulnerability to error, this distinction reveals fundamentally different causal origins: human-cognitive versus artificial-stochastic. To develop this framework and substantiate the distinction, the analysis draws critically upon Dennett's mechanistic functionalism and Rescher's methodological pragmatism. I argue that a systematic differentiation of these error profiles raises critical philosophical questions concerning semantic coherence, security robustness, epistemic limits, and control mechanisms in human-AI collaborative software development. The paper also utilizes Floridi's levels of abstraction to provide a nuanced understanding of how these error dimensions interact and may evolve with technological advancements. This analysis aims to offer philosophers a structured framework for understanding GenAI's unique epistemological challenges, shaped by these architectural foundations, while also providing software engineers a basis for more critically informed engagement.</description>

      <title>Consistency-based Abductive Reasoning over Perceptual Errors of Multiple Pre-trained Models in Novel Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of pre-trained perception models in novel environments often leads to performance degradation due to distributional shifts. Although recent artificial intelligence approaches for metacognition use logical rules to characterize and filter model errors, improving precision often comes at the cost of reduced recall. This paper addresses the hypothesis that leveraging multiple pre-trained models can mitigate this recall reduction. We formulate the challenge of identifying and managing conflicting predictions from various models as a consistency-based abduction problem. The input predictions and the learned error detection rules derived from each model are encoded in a logic program. We then seek an abductive explanation--a subset of model predictions--that maximizes prediction coverage while ensuring the rate of logical inconsistencies (derived from domain constraints) remains below a specified threshold. We propose two algorithms for this knowledge representation task: an exact method based on Integer Programming (IP) and an efficient Heuristic Search (HS). Through extensive experiments on a simulated aerial imagery dataset featuring controlled, complex distributional shifts, we demonstrate that our abduction-based framework outperforms individual models and standard ensemble baselines, achieving, for instance, average relative improvements of approximately 13.6% in F1-score and 16.6% in accuracy across 15 diverse test datasets when compared to the best individual model. Our results validate the use of consistency-based abduction as an effective mechanism to robustly integrate knowledge from multiple imperfect reasoners in challenging, novel scenarios.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Top-$k$ Decoding For Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Top-$k$ decoding is a widely used method for sampling from LLMs: at each token, only the largest $k$ next-token-probabilities are kept, and the next token is sampled after re-normalizing them to sum to unity. Top-$k$ and other sampling methods are motivated by the intuition that true next-token distributions are sparse, and the noisy LLM probabilities need to be truncated. However, to our knowledge, a precise theoretical motivation for the use of top-$k$ decoding is missing. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework that both explains and generalizes top-$k$ decoding. We view decoding at a fixed token as the recovery of a sparse probability distribution. We consider \emph{Bregman decoders} obtained by minimizing a separable Bregman divergence (for both the \emph{primal} and \emph{dual} cases) with a sparsity-inducing $\ell_0$ regularization. Despite the combinatorial nature of the objective, we show how to optimize it efficiently for a large class of divergences. We show that the optimal decoding strategies are greedy, and further that the loss function is discretely convex in $k$, so that binary search provably and efficiently finds the optimal $k$. We show that top-$k$ decoding arises as a special case for the KL divergence, and identify new decoding strategies that have distinct behaviors (e.g., non-linearly up-weighting larger probabilities after re-normalization).</description>

      <title>DiffVLA: Vision-Language Guided Diffusion Planning for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research interest in end-to-end autonomous driving has surged owing to its fully differentiable design integrating modular tasks, i.e. perception, prediction and planing, which enables optimization in pursuit of the ultimate goal. Despite the great potential of the end-to-end paradigm, existing methods suffer from several aspects including expensive BEV (bird's eye view) computation, action diversity, and sub-optimal decision in complex real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid sparse-dense diffusion policy, empowered by a Vision-Language Model (VLM), called Diff-VLA. We explore the sparse diffusion representation for efficient multi-modal driving behavior. Moreover, we rethink the effectiveness of VLM driving decision and improve the trajectory generation guidance through deep interaction across agent, map instances and VLM output. Our method shows superior performance in Autonomous Grand Challenge 2025 which contains challenging real and reactive synthetic scenarios. Our methods achieves 45.0 PDMS.</description>

      <title>CaseEdit: Enhancing Localized Commonsense Reasoning via Null-Space Constrained Knowledge Editing in Small Parameter Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance on factual recall and general reasoning but struggle to adapt to user-specific, commonsense knowledge, a challenge particularly acute in small-parameter settings where computational efficiency is prioritized. We introduce CaseEdit, a new dataset and generation pipeline for evaluating localized, personalized commonsense knowledge editing in small LLMs to address this. Built upon the ATOMIC20/20 commonsense graph, CaseEdit uses a multi-stage inference process to generate both typical and atypical contextual edits for household objects, paired with targeted evaluation questions across four axes: reliability, generalization, locality, and portability. We evaluate established knowledge editing methods using CaseEdit and demonstrate that AlphaEdit, a technique employing null-space projection to minimize interference with unrelated knowledge, consistently outperforms other methods when applied to an LLaMA 3.2 3B model, even in scalability tests, showing minimal ripple effects. Our results indicate that using CaseEdit with effective editing techniques like AlphaEdit allows small models to internalize high-quality, context-sensitive common-sense knowledge, paving the way for lightweight, personalized assistants.</description>

      <title>Recalibrating the Compass: Integrating Large Language Models into Classical Research Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) are transforming core quantitative methods in communication research in particular, and in the social sciences more broadly-namely, content analysis, survey research, and experimental studies. Rather than replacing classical approaches, LLMs introduce new possibilities for coding and interpreting text, simulating dynamic respondents, and generating personalized and interactive stimuli. Drawing on recent interdisciplinary work, the paper highlights both the potential and limitations of LLMs as research tools, including issues of validity, bias, and interpretability. To situate these developments theoretically, the paper revisits Lasswell's foundational framework -- "Who says what, in which channel, to whom, with what effect?" -- and demonstrates how LLMs reconfigure message studies, audience analysis, and effects research by enabling interpretive variation, audience trajectory modeling, and counterfactual experimentation. Revisiting the metaphor of the methodological compass, the paper argues that classical research logics remain essential as the field integrates LLMs and generative AI. By treating LLMs not only as technical instruments but also as epistemic and cultural tools, the paper calls for thoughtful, rigorous, and imaginative use of LLMs in future communication and social science research.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Compositional Ability Gap in Vision-Language Reasoning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable reward, whether large vision-language models (VLMs) can directly inherit such capabilities through similar post-training strategies remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic compositional probing study to evaluate whether current VLMs trained with RL or other post-training strategies can compose capabilities across modalities or tasks under out-of-distribution conditions. We design a suite of diagnostic tasks that train models on unimodal tasks or isolated reasoning skills, and evaluate them on multimodal, compositional variants requiring skill integration. Through comparisons between supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL-trained models, we identify three key findings: (1) RL-trained models consistently outperform SFT on compositional generalization, demonstrating better integration of learned skills; (2) although VLMs achieve strong performance on individual tasks, they struggle to generalize compositionally under cross-modal and cross-task scenario, revealing a significant gap in current training strategies; (3) enforcing models to explicitly describe visual content before reasoning (e.g., caption-before-thinking), along with rewarding progressive vision-to-text grounding, yields notable gains. It highlights two essential ingredients for improving compositionality in VLMs: visual-to-text alignment and accurate visual grounding. Our findings shed light on the current limitations of RL-based reasoning VLM training and provide actionable insights toward building models that reason compositionally across modalities and tasks.</description>

      <title>Fusion Intelligence for Digital Twinning AI Data Centers: A Synergistic GenAI-PhyAI Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosion in artificial intelligence (AI) applications is pushing the development of AI-dedicated data centers (AIDCs), creating management challenges that traditional methods and standalone AI solutions struggle to address. While digital twins are beneficial for AI-based design validation and operational optimization, current AI methods for their creation face limitations. Specifically, physical AI (PhyAI) aims to capture the underlying physical laws, which demands extensive, case-specific customization, and generative AI (GenAI) can produce inaccurate or hallucinated results. We propose Fusion Intelligence, a novel framework synergizing GenAI's automation with PhyAI's domain grounding. In this dual-agent collaboration, GenAI interprets natural language prompts to generate tokenized AIDC digital twins. Subsequently, PhyAI optimizes these generated twins by enforcing physical constraints and assimilating real-time data. Case studies demonstrate the advantages of our framework in automating the creation and validation of AIDC digital twins. These twins deliver predictive analytics to support power usage effectiveness (PUE) optimization in the design stage. With operational data collected, the digital twin accuracy is further improved compared with pure physics-based models developed by human experts. Fusion Intelligence offers a promising pathway to accelerate digital transformation. It enables more reliable and efficient AI-driven digital transformation for a broad range of mission-critical infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Toward Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Data Center Operations: A Tropical Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data centers are the backbone of computing capacity. Operating data centers in the tropical regions faces unique challenges due to consistently high ambient temperature and elevated relative humidity throughout the year. These conditions result in increased cooling costs to maintain the reliability of the computing systems. While existing machine learning-based approaches have demonstrated potential to elevate operations to a more proactive and intelligent level, their deployment remains dubious due to concerns about model extrapolation capabilities and associated system safety issues. To address these concerns, this article proposes incorporating the physical characteristics of data centers into traditional data-driven machine learning solutions. We begin by introducing the data center system, including the relevant multiphysics processes and the data-physics availability. Next, we outline the associated modeling and optimization problems and propose an integrated, physics-informed machine learning system to address them. Using the proposed system, we present relevant applications across varying levels of operational intelligence. A case study on an industry-grade tropical data center is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we discuss key challenges and highlight potential future directions.</description>

      <title>Task Memory Engine: Spatial Memory for Robust Multi-Step LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) falter in multi-step interactions -- often hallucinating, repeating actions, or misinterpreting user corrections -- due to reliance on linear, unstructured context. This fragility stems from the lack of persistent memory to track evolving goals and task dependencies, undermining trust in autonomous agents. We introduce the Task Memory Engine (TME), a modular memory controller that transforms existing LLMs into robust, revision-aware agents without fine-tuning. TME implements a spatial memory framework that replaces flat context with graph-based structures to support consistent, multi-turn reasoning. Departing from linear concatenation and ReAct-style prompting, TME builds a dynamic task graph -- either a tree or directed acyclic graph (DAG) -- to map user inputs to subtasks, align them with prior context, and enable dependency-tracked revisions. Its Task Representation and Intent Management (TRIM) component models task semantics and user intent to ensure accurate interpretation. Across four multi-turn scenarios-trip planning, cooking, meeting scheduling, and shopping cart editing -- TME eliminates 100% of hallucinations and misinterpretations in three tasks, and reduces hallucinations by 66.7% and misinterpretations by 83.3% across 27 user turns, outperforming ReAct. TME's modular design supports plug-and-play deployment and domain-specific customization, adaptable to both personal assistants and enterprise automation. We release TME's codebase, benchmarks, and components as open-source resources, enabling researchers to develop reliable LLM agents. TME's scalable architecture addresses a critical gap in agent performance across complex, interactive settings.</description>

      <title>Style2Code: A Style-Controllable Code Generation Framework with Dual-Modal Contrastive Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllable code generation, the ability to synthesize code that follows a specified style while maintaining functionality, remains a challenging task. We propose a two-stage training framework combining contrastive learning and conditional decoding to enable flexible style control. The first stage aligns code style representations with semantic and structural features. In the second stage, we fine-tune a language model (e.g., Flan-T5) conditioned on the learned style vector to guide generation. Our method supports style interpolation and user personalization via lightweight mixing. Compared to prior work, our unified framework offers improved stylistic control without sacrificing code correctness. This is among the first approaches to combine contrastive alignment with conditional decoding for style-guided code generation.</description>

      <title>BizFinBench: A Business-Driven Real-World Financial Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models excel in general tasks, yet assessing their reliability in logic-heavy, precision-critical domains like finance, law, and healthcare remains challenging. To address this, we introduce BizFinBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world financial applications. BizFinBench consists of 6,781 well-annotated queries in Chinese, spanning five dimensions: numerical calculation, reasoning, information extraction, prediction recognition, and knowledge-based question answering, grouped into nine fine-grained categories. The benchmark includes both objective and subjective metrics. We also introduce IteraJudge, a novel LLM evaluation method that reduces bias when LLMs serve as evaluators in objective metrics. We benchmark 25 models, including both proprietary and open-source systems. Extensive experiments show that no model dominates across all tasks. Our evaluation reveals distinct capability patterns: (1) In Numerical Calculation, Claude-3.5-Sonnet (63.18) and DeepSeek-R1 (64.04) lead, while smaller models like Qwen2.5-VL-3B (15.92) lag significantly; (2) In Reasoning, proprietary models dominate (ChatGPT-o3: 83.58, Gemini-2.0-Flash: 81.15), with open-source models trailing by up to 19.49 points; (3) In Information Extraction, the performance spread is the largest, with DeepSeek-R1 scoring 71.46, while Qwen3-1.7B scores 11.23; (4) In Prediction Recognition, performance variance is minimal, with top models scoring between 39.16 and 50.00. We find that while current LLMs handle routine finance queries competently, they struggle with complex scenarios requiring cross-concept reasoning. BizFinBench offers a rigorous, business-aligned benchmark for future research. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HiThink-Research/BizFinBench.</description>

      <title>Origin Tracer: A Method for Detecting LoRA Fine-Tuning Origins in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, their deployment often involves fine-tuning to enhance performance on specific downstream tasks. However, this customization is sometimes accompanied by misleading claims about the origins, raising significant concerns about transparency and trust within the open-source community. Existing model verification techniques typically assess functional, representational, and weight similarities. However, these approaches often struggle against obfuscation techniques, such as permutations and scaling transformations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel detection method Origin-Tracer that rigorously determines whether a model has been fine-tuned from a specified base model. This method includes the ability to extract the LoRA rank utilized during the fine-tuning process, providing a more robust verification framework. This framework is the first to provide a formalized approach specifically aimed at pinpointing the sources of model fine-tuning. We empirically validated our method on thirty-one diverse open-source models under conditions that simulate real-world obfuscation scenarios. We empirically analyze the effectiveness of our framework and finally, discuss its limitations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and indicate its potential to establish new benchmarks for model verification.</description>

      <title>Causal-LLaVA: Causal Disentanglement for Mitigating Hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in visual understanding tasks, yet they often suffer from object hallucinations--generating descriptions of objects that are inconsistent with or entirely absent from the input. This issue is closely related to dataset biases, where frequent co-occurrences of objects lead to entangled semantic representations across modalities. As a result, models may erroneously activate object representations that are commonly associated with the input but not actually present.
  To address this, we propose a causality-driven disentanglement framework that mitigates hallucinations through causal intervention. Our approach includes a Causal-Driven Projector in the visual pathway and a Causal Intervention Module integrated into the final transformer layer of the language model. These components work together to reduce spurious correlations caused by biased training data.
  Experimental results show that our method significantly reduces hallucinations while maintaining strong performance on multiple multimodal benchmarks. Visualization analyses further confirm improved separability of object representations.

      <title>Judging with Many Minds: Do More Perspectives Mean Less Prejudice?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-as-Judge has emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation, enabling large language models (LLMs) to provide reward signals in trainings. While recent work has explored multi-agent extensions such as multi-agent debate and meta-judging to enhance evaluation quality, the question of how intrinsic biases manifest in these settings remains underexplored. In this study, we conduct a systematic analysis of four diverse bias types: position bias, verbosity bias, chain-of-thought bias, and bandwagon bias. We evaluate these biases across two widely adopted multi-agent LLM-as-Judge frameworks: Multi-Agent-Debate and LLM-as-Meta-Judge. Our results show that debate framework amplifies biases sharply after the initial debate, and this increased bias is sustained in subsequent rounds, while meta-judge approaches exhibit greater resistance. We further investigate the incorporation of PINE, a leading single-agent debiasing method, as a bias-free agent within these systems. The results reveal that this bias-free agent effectively reduces biases in debate settings but provides less benefit in meta-judge scenarios. Our work provides a comprehensive study of bias behavior in multi-agent LLM-as-Judge systems and highlights the need for targeted bias mitigation strategies in collaborative evaluation settings.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and Enhancing LLM Agents in Localizing Linux Kernel Bugs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Linux kernel is a critical system, serving as the foundation for numerous systems. Bugs in the Linux kernel can cause serious consequences, affecting billions of users. Fault localization (FL), which aims at identifying the buggy code elements in software, plays an essential role in software quality assurance. While recent LLM agents have achieved promising accuracy in FL on recent benchmarks like SWE-bench, it remains unclear how well these methods perform in the Linux kernel, where FL is much more challenging due to the large-scale code base, limited observability, and diverse impact factors. In this paper, we introduce LinuxFLBench, a FL benchmark constructed from real-world Linux kernel bugs. We conduct an empirical study to assess the performance of state-of-the-art LLM agents on the Linux kernel. Our initial results reveal that existing agents struggle with this task, achieving a best top-1 accuracy of only 41.6% at file level. To address this challenge, we propose LinuxFL$^+$, an enhancement framework designed to improve FL effectiveness of LLM agents for the Linux kernel. LinuxFL$^+$ substantially improves the FL accuracy of all studied agents (e.g., 7.2% - 11.2% accuracy increase) with minimal costs. Data and code are available at https://github.com/FudanSELab/LinuxFLBench.</description>

      <title>Automated CAD Modeling Sequence Generation from Text Descriptions via Transformer-Based Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing complex computer-aided design (CAD) models is often time-consuming due to challenges such as computational inefficiency and the difficulty of generating precise models. We propose a novel language-guided framework for industrial design automation to address these issues, integrating large language models (LLMs) with computer-automated design (CAutoD).Through this framework, CAD models are automatically generated from parameters and appearance descriptions, supporting the automation of design tasks during the detailed CAD design phase. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a semi-automated data annotation pipeline that leverages LLMs and vision-language large models (VLLMs) to generate high-quality parameters and appearance descriptions; (2) a Transformer-based CAD generator (TCADGen) that predicts modeling sequences via dual-channel feature aggregation; (3) an enhanced CAD modeling generation model, called CADLLM, that is designed to refine the generated sequences by incorporating the confidence scores from TCADGen. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional methods in both accuracy and efficiency, providing a powerful tool for automating industrial workflows and generating complex CAD models from textual prompts.

Abstract: In this short report, we present an automated pipeline tailored for the genomics domain and introduce \textit{Genome-Bench}, a new benchmark constructed from over a decade of scientific forum discussions on genome engineering. Our pipeline transforms raw interactions into a reinforcement learning friendly multiple-choice questions format, supported by 3000+ high quality question answer pairs spanning foundational biology, experimental troubleshooting, tool usage, and beyond.

      <title>Turing Test 2.0: The General Intelligence Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence (A.I.) and large language models like Chat-GPT, a new race for achieving artificial general intelligence (A.G.I) has started. While many speculate how and when A.I. will achieve A.G.I., there is no clear agreement on how A.G.I. can be detected in A.I. models, even when popular tools like the Turing test (and its modern variations) are used to measure their intelligence. In this work, we discuss why traditional methods like the Turing test do not suffice for measuring or detecting A.G.I. and provide a new, practical method that can be used to decide if a (computer or any other) system has reached or surpassed A.G.I. To achieve this, we make two new contributions. First, we present a clear definition for general intelligence (G.I.) and set a G.I. threshold (G.I.T.) that can be used to distinguish between systems that achieve A.G.I. and systems that do not. Second, we present a new framework on how to construct tests that can detect if a system has achieved G.I. in a simple, comprehensive, and clear-cut fail/pass way. We call this novel framework the Turing Tests 2.0. We then demonstrate real-life examples of applying tests that follow our Turing Tests 2.0 framework on modern A.I. models.</description>

      <title>AMQA: An Adversarial Dataset for Benchmarking Bias of LLMs in Medicine and Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reaching expert-level accuracy on medical diagnosis questions, yet their mistakes and the biases behind them pose life-critical risks. Bias linked to race, sex, and socioeconomic status is already well known, but a consistent and automatic testbed for measuring it is missing. To fill this gap, this paper presents AMQA -- an Adversarial Medical Question-Answering dataset -- built for automated, large-scale bias evaluation of LLMs in medical QA. AMQA includes 4,806 medical QA pairs sourced from the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) dataset, generated using a multi-agent framework to create diverse adversarial descriptions and question pairs. Using AMQA, we benchmark five representative LLMs and find surprisingly substantial disparities: even GPT-4.1, the least biased model tested, answers privileged-group questions over 10 percentage points more accurately than unprivileged ones. Compared with the existing benchmark CPV, AMQA reveals 15% larger accuracy gaps on average between privileged and unprivileged groups. Our dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/XY-Showing/AMQA to support reproducible research and advance trustworthy, bias-aware medical AI.</description>

      <title>Automated Text-to-Table for Reasoning-Intensive Table QA: Pipeline Design and Benchmarking Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning with tabular data holds increasing importance in modern applications, yet comprehensive evaluation methodologies for reasoning-intensive Table Question Answering (QA) tasks remain nascent. Existing research is constrained by two primary bottlenecks: 1) Reliance on costly manually annotated real-world data, which is difficult to cover complex reasoning scenarios; 2) The heterogeneity of table structures hinders systematic analysis of the intrinsic mechanisms behind the underperformance of LLMs, especially in reasoning-intensive tasks. To address these issues, we propose an automated generation pipeline AutoT2T that transforms mathematical word problems into table-based reasoning tasks, eliminating the need for manual annotation. The pipeline can generate multiple variants of a table for the same reasoning problem, including noisy versions to support robustness evaluation. Based on this, we construct a new benchmark TabularGSM, which systematically spans a range of table complexities and trap problems. Experimental analyses through AutoT2T and TabularGSM reveal that the tight coupling between reasoning and retrieval or identification processes is a key factor underlying the failure of LLMs in complex Table QA tasks. This highlights the necessity for models to develop synergistic reasoning capabilities in order to perform effectively in complex Table QA tasks.</description>

      <title>LLM-Agent-Controller: A Universal Multi-Agent Large Language Model System as a Control Engineer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the LLM-Agent-Controller, a multi-agent large language model (LLM) system developed to address a wide range of problems in control engineering (Control Theory). The system integrates a central controller agent with multiple specialized auxiliary agents, responsible for tasks such as controller design, model representation, control analysis, time-domain response, and simulation. A supervisor oversees high-level decision-making and workflow coordination, enhancing the system's reliability and efficiency. The LLM-Agent-Controller incorporates advanced capabilities, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Chain-of-Thought reasoning, self-criticism and correction, efficient memory handling, and user-friendly natural language communication. It is designed to function without requiring users to have prior knowledge of Control Theory, enabling them to input problems in plain language and receive complete, real-time solutions. To evaluate the system, we propose new performance metrics assessing both individual agents and the system as a whole. We test five categories of Control Theory problems and benchmark performance across three advanced LLMs. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive qualitative conversational analysis covering all key services. Results show that the LLM-Agent-Controller successfully solved 83% of general tasks, with individual agents achieving an average success rate of 87%. Performance improved with more advanced LLMs. This research demonstrates the potential of multi-agent LLM architectures to solve complex, domain-specific problems. By integrating specialized agents, supervisory control, and advanced reasoning, the LLM-Agent-Controller offers a scalable, robust, and accessible solution framework that can be extended to various technical domains.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maritime transportation is the backbone of global trade, making ship inspection essential for ensuring maritime safety and environmental protection. Port State Control (PSC), conducted by national ports, enforces compliance with safety regulations, with ship detention being the most severe consequence, impacting both ship schedules and company reputations. Traditional machine learning methods for ship detention prediction are limited by the capacity of representation learning and thus suffer from low accuracy. Meanwhile, autoencoder-based deep learning approaches face challenges due to the severe data imbalance in learning historical PSC detention records. To address these limitations, we propose Maritime Ship Detention with Large Language Models (MSD-LLM), integrating a dual robust subspace recovery (DSR) layer-based autoencoder with a progressive learning pipeline to handle imbalanced data and extract meaningful PSC representations. Then, a large language model groups and ranks features to identify likely detention cases, enabling dynamic thresholding for flexible detention predictions. Extensive evaluations on 31,707 PSC inspection records from the Asia-Pacific region show that MSD-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods more than 12\% on Area Under the Curve (AUC) for Singapore ports. Additionally, it demonstrates robustness to real-world challenges, making it adaptable to diverse maritime risk assessment scenarios.</description>

      <title>Think Again! The Effect of Test-Time Compute on Preferences, Opinions, and Beliefs of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become deeply integrated into human life and increasingly influence decision-making, it's crucial to evaluate whether and to what extent they exhibit subjective preferences, opinions, and beliefs. These tendencies may stem from biases within the models, which may shape their behavior, influence the advice and recommendations they offer to users, and potentially reinforce certain viewpoints. This paper presents the Preference, Opinion, and Belief survey (POBs), a benchmark developed to assess LLMs' subjective inclinations across societal, cultural, ethical, and personal domains. We applied our benchmark to evaluate leading open- and closed-source LLMs, measuring desired properties such as reliability, neutrality, and consistency. In addition, we investigated the effect of increasing the test-time compute, through reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms, on those metrics. While effective in other tasks, our results show that these mechanisms offer only limited gains in our domain. Furthermore, we reveal that newer model versions are becoming less consistent and more biased toward specific viewpoints, highlighting a blind spot and a concerning trend.

      <title>SynLogic: Synthesizing Verifiable Reasoning Data at Scale for Learning Logical Reasoning and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek R1 have demonstrated the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance reasoning abilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). While open-source replication efforts have primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, methods and resources for developing general reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. This gap is partly due to the challenge of collecting diverse and verifiable reasoning data suitable for RL. We hypothesize that logical reasoning is critical for developing general reasoning capabilities, as logic forms a fundamental building block of reasoning. In this work, we present SynLogic, a data synthesis framework and dataset that generates diverse logical reasoning data at scale, encompassing 35 diverse logical reasoning tasks. The SynLogic approach enables controlled synthesis of data with adjustable difficulty and quantity. Importantly, all examples can be verified by simple rules, making them ideally suited for RL with verifiable rewards. In our experiments, we validate the effectiveness of RL training on the SynLogic dataset based on 7B and 32B models. SynLogic leads to state-of-the-art logical reasoning performance among open-source datasets, surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B by 6 points on BBEH. Furthermore, mixing SynLogic data with mathematical and coding tasks improves the training efficiency of these domains and significantly enhances reasoning generalization. Notably, our mixed training model outperforms DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across multiple benchmarks. These findings position SynLogic as a valuable resource for advancing the broader reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We open-source both the data synthesis pipeline and the SynLogic dataset at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/SynLogic.</description>

      <title>Token-Importance Guided Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) generate outputs aligned with human preferences is important for safe and effective AI interactions. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) employs an implicit reward function to optimize the policy model, however, it and its related variants overlook the differential importance of individual tokens and are sensitive to judgment noise in preference datasets during generation. Although recent methods attempt to assess the important weight of tokens via probability prediction or simplistic weighting schemes, these evaluation methods are prone to biases and still cannot fully address these issues. To solve this problem, we propose the Token-Importance Guided Direct Preference Optimization (TI-DPO), which introduces two key innovations: the gradient-based token-importance weights that dynamically prioritize critical tokens, and a triple loss that explicitly guides model outputs to approach human-preferred responses and stay away from non-preferred responses. Experimental results show that TI-DPO achieves higher accuracy and stronger generative diversity, providing more stable and computationally efficient solutions compared with DPO and other RLHF methods.</description>

      <title>FieldWorkArena: Agentic AI Benchmark for Real Field Work Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes FieldWorkArena, a benchmark for agentic AI targeting real-world field work. With the recent increase in demand for agentic AI, they are required to monitor and report safety and health incidents, as well as manufacturing-related incidents, that may occur in real-world work environments. Existing agentic AI benchmarks have been limited to evaluating web tasks and are insufficient for evaluating agents in real-world work environments, where complexity increases significantly. In this paper, we define a new action space that agentic AI should possess for real world work environment benchmarks and improve the evaluation function from previous methods to assess the performance of agentic AI in diverse real-world tasks. The dataset consists of videos captured on-site and documents actually used in factories and warehouses, and tasks were created based on interviews with on-site workers and managers. Evaluation results confirmed that performance evaluation considering the characteristics of Multimodal LLM (MLLM) such as GPT-4o is feasible. Additionally, the effectiveness and limitations of the proposed new evaluation method were identified. The complete dataset (HuggingFace) and evaluation program (GitHub) can be downloaded from the following website: https://en-documents.research.global.fujitsu.com/fieldworkarena/.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models' Reasoning Stalls: An Investigation into the Capabilities of Frontier Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical methods to examine the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to use Automated Theorem Prover (ATP) reasoning strategies are studied. We evaluate the performance of State of the Art models from December 2023 and August 2024 on PRONTOQA steamroller reasoning problems. For that, we develop methods for assessing LLM response accuracy and correct answer correlation.
  Our results show that progress in improving LLM reasoning abilities has stalled over the nine month period. By tracking completion tokens, we show that almost all improvement in reasoning ability since GPT-4 was released can be attributed to either hidden system prompts or the training of models to automatically use generic Chain of Thought prompting strategies. Among the ATP reasoning strategies tried, we found that current frontier LLMs are best able to follow the bottom-up (also known as forward-chaining) strategy. A low positive correlation was found between an LLM response containing correct reasoning and arriving at the correct conclusion.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Planning: A Comprehensive and Systematic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planning represents a fundamental capability of intelligent agents, requiring comprehensive environmental understanding, rigorous logical reasoning, and effective sequential decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on certain planning tasks, their broader application in this domain warrants systematic investigation. This paper presents a comprehensive review of LLM-based planning. Specifically, this survey is structured as follows: First, we establish the theoretical foundations by introducing essential definitions and categories about automated planning. Next, we provide a detailed taxonomy and analysis of contemporary LLM-based planning methodologies, categorizing them into three principal approaches: 1) External Module Augmented Methods that combine LLMs with additional components for planning, 2) Finetuning-based Methods that involve using trajectory data and feedback signals to adjust LLMs in order to improve their planning abilities, and 3) Searching-based Methods that break down complex tasks into simpler components, navigate the planning space, or enhance decoding strategies to find the best solutions. Subsequently, we systematically summarize existing evaluation frameworks, including benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics and performance comparisons between representative planning methods. Finally, we discuss the underlying mechanisms enabling LLM-based planning and outline promising research directions for this rapidly evolving field. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and drive progress in this field.</description>

      <title>Beyond Safe Answers: A Benchmark for Evaluating True Risk Awareness in Large Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable proficiency of \textit{Large Reasoning Models} (LRMs) in handling complex reasoning tasks, their reliability in safety-critical scenarios remains uncertain. Existing evaluations primarily assess response-level safety, neglecting a critical issue we identify as \textbf{\textit{Superficial Safety Alignment} (SSA)} -- a phenomenon where models produce superficially safe outputs while internal reasoning processes fail to genuinely detect and mitigate underlying risks, resulting in inconsistent safety behaviors across multiple sampling attempts. To systematically investigate SSA, we introduce \textbf{Beyond Safe Answers (BSA)} bench, a novel benchmark comprising 2,000 challenging instances organized into three distinct SSA scenario types and spanning nine risk categories, each meticulously annotated with risk rationales. Evaluations of 19 state-of-the-art LRMs demonstrate the difficulty of this benchmark, with top-performing models achieving only 38.0\% accuracy in correctly identifying risk rationales. We further explore the efficacy of safety rules, specialized fine-tuning on safety reasoning data, and diverse decoding strategies in mitigating SSA. Our work provides a comprehensive assessment tool for evaluating and improving safety reasoning fidelity in LRMs, advancing the development of genuinely risk-aware and reliably safe AI systems.</description>

      <title>Concise Reasoning, Big Gains: Pruning Long Reasoning Trace with Difficulty-Aware Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation methods can effectively transfer reasoning abilities to base models but suffer from two major limitations: excessive verbosity of reasoning traces and inadequate adaptability to problem difficulty. Long reasoning traces significantly increase inference costs, and uniform-length solutions prevent base models from learning adaptive reasoning strategies. To address these issues, we propose a difficulty-aware prompting (DAP) method to dynamically shorten reasoning traces without performance loss. In our approach, a large teacher model first judges each problem's difficulty and then rewrites its reasoning traces to an appropriate shorter length, yielding concise yet complete reasoning traces. Leveraging the DAP pipeline, we curate a distilled dataset called LiteCoT consisting of 100K concise reasoning examples, with solutions averaging only 720 tokens (an order of magnitude shorter than typical CoTs). Using LiteCoT, we distilled a new family of reasoning models called Liter (1.5B, 7B, and 32B) based on the Qwen2.5 architecture. Experiments show that a student model fine-tuned on just 100K of these difficulty-pruned CoT samples outperforms a model distilled on 800K original Long CoT samples, while significantly reducing training and inference costs. Our method also generalizes well: across 11 diverse benchmarks, the shorter difficulty-aware CoTs achieve equal or better accuracy than Long chains, using far fewer tokens. For example, on the challenging AIME24 exam, our approach reaches $74.2\%$ Pass@1 using only about 5K inference tokens, surpassing other methods that consume many more tokens. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Evanwu1125/LiteCoT.</description>

      <title>ReChisel: Effective Automatic Chisel Code Generation by LLM with Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coding with hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog is a time-intensive and laborious task. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in applying LLMs to assist with HDL coding. Recent efforts have demonstrated the potential of LLMs in translating natural language to traditional HDL Verilog. Chisel, a next-generation HDL based on Scala, introduces higher-level abstractions, facilitating more concise, maintainable, and scalable hardware designs. However, the potential of using LLMs for Chisel code generation remains largely unexplored. This work proposes ReChisel, an LLM-based agentic system designed to enhance the effectiveness of Chisel code generation. ReChisel incorporates a reflection mechanism to iteratively refine the quality of generated code using feedback from compilation and simulation processes, and introduces an escape mechanism to break free from non-progress loops. Experiments demonstrate that ReChisel significantly improves the success rate of Chisel code generation, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based agentic systems for Verilog code generation.</description>

      <title>Divide and Conquer: Grounding LLMs as Efficient Decision-Making Agents via Offline Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While showing sophisticated reasoning abilities, large language models (LLMs) still struggle with long-horizon decision-making tasks due to deficient exploration and long-term credit assignment, especially in sparse-reward scenarios. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer principle, we propose an innovative framework **GLIDER** (**G**rounding **L**anguage Models as Eff**I**cient **D**ecision-Making Agents via Offline Hi**E**rarchical **R**einforcement Learning) that introduces a parameter-efficient and generally applicable hierarchy to LLM policies. We develop a scheme where the low-level controller is supervised with abstract, step-by-step plans that are learned and instructed by the high-level policy. This design decomposes complicated problems into a series of coherent chain-of-thought reasoning sub-tasks, providing flexible temporal abstraction to significantly enhance exploration and learning for long-horizon tasks. Furthermore, GLIDER facilitates fast online adaptation to non-stationary environments owing to the strong transferability of its task-agnostic low-level skills. Experiments on ScienceWorld and ALFWorld benchmarks show that GLIDER achieves consistent performance gains, along with enhanced generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Language Model-Enhanced Message Passing for Heterophilic Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional graph neural networks (GNNs), which rely on homophily-driven message passing, struggle with heterophilic graphs where connected nodes exhibit dissimilar features and different labels. While existing methods address heterophily through graph structure refinement or adaptation of neighbor aggregation functions, they often overlook the semantic potential of node text, rely on suboptimal message representation for propagation and compromise performance on homophilic graphs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel language model (LM)-enhanced message passing approach for heterophilic graph leaning (LEMP4HG). Specifically, in the context of text-attributed graph, we provide paired node texts for LM to generate their connection analysis, which are encoded and then fused with paired node textual embeddings through a gating mechanism. The synthesized messages are semantically enriched and adaptively balanced with both nodes' information, which mitigates contradictory signals when neighbor aggregation in heterophilic regions. Furthermore, we introduce an active learning strategy guided by our heuristic MVRD (Modulated Variation of Reliable Distance), selectively enhancing node pairs suffer most from message passing, reducing the cost of analysis generation and side effects on homophilic regions. Extensive experiments validate that our approach excels on heterophilic graphs and performs robustly on homophilic ones, with a graph convolutional network (GCN) backbone and a practical budget.</description>

      <title>Done Is Better than Perfect: Unlocking Efficient Reasoning by Structured Multi-Turn Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are criticized for the excessively lengthy Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to derive the final answer, suffering from high first-token and overall latency. Typically, the CoT of LRMs mixes multiple thinking units; each unit attempts to produce a candidate answer to the original query. Hence, a natural idea to improve efficiency is to reduce the unit number. Yet, the fact that the thinking units in vanilla CoT cannot be explicitly managed renders doing so challenging. This paper introduces Multi-Turn Decomposition (MinD) to decode conventional CoT into a sequence of explicit, structured, and turn-wise interactions to bridge the gap. In MinD, the model provides a multi-turn response to the query, where each turn embraces a thinking unit and yields a corresponding answer. The subsequent turns can reflect, verify, revise, or explore alternative approaches to both the thinking and answer parts of earlier ones. This not only makes the answer delivered more swiftly, but also enables explicit controls over the iterative reasoning process (i.e., users may halt or continue at any turn). We follow a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) then reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm to realize MinD. We first rephrase the outputs of an LRM into multi-turn formats by prompting another LLM, and then tune the LRM with such data. Observing that the tuned model tends to consume even more tokens than the original one (probably due to that the multi-turn formats introduce additional answer tokens), we advocate leveraging RL algorithms like GRPO to prioritize correct outputs with fewer turns. Trained on the MATH dataset using R1-Distill models, MinD can achieve up to ~70% reduction in both output token usage and time to first token (TTFT), while maintaining competitive performance on reasoning benchmarks such as MATH-500, AIME24, AMC23, and GPQA-Diamond.</description>

      <title>Types of Relations: Defining Analogies with Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to behave intelligently both humans and machines have to represent their knowledge adequately for how it is used. Humans often use analogies to transfer their knowledge to new domains, or help others with this transfer via explanations. Hence, an important question is: What representation can be used to construct, find, and evaluate analogies? In this paper, we study features of a domain that are important for constructing analogies. We do so by formalizing knowledge domains as categories. We use the well-known example of the analogy between the solar system and the hydrogen atom to demonstrate how to construct domain categories. We also show how functors, pullbacks, and pushouts can be used to define an analogy, describe its core and a corresponding blend of the underlying domains.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the capabilities of language models by integrating external knowledge. Due to the diversity of data sources and the constraints of memory and computing resources, real-world data is often scattered in multiple devices. Conventional RAGs that store massive amounts of scattered data centrally face increasing privacy concerns and high computational costs. Additionally, RAG in a central node raises latency issues when searching over a large-scale knowledge base. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed Knowledge Graph-based RAG approach, referred to as DGRAG, in an edge-cloud system, where each edge device maintains a local knowledge base without the need to share it with the cloud, instead sharing only summaries of its knowledge. Specifically, DGRAG has two main phases. In the Distributed Knowledge Construction phase, DGRAG organizes local knowledge using knowledge graphs, generating subgraph summaries and storing them in a summary database in the cloud as information sharing. In the Collaborative Retrieval and Generation phase, DGRAG first performs knowledge retrieval and answer generation locally, and a gate mechanism determines whether the query is beyond the scope of local knowledge or processing capabilities. For queries that exceed the local knowledge scope, the cloud retrieves knowledge from the most relevant edges based on the summaries and generates a more precise answer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DGRAG approach in significantly improving the quality of question-answering tasks over baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>HS-STAR: Hierarchical Sampling for Self-Taught Reasoners via Difficulty Estimation and Budget Reallocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-taught reasoners (STaRs) enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) by leveraging self-generated responses for self-training. Recent studies have incorporated reward models to guide response selection or decoding, aiming to obtain higher-quality data. However, they typically allocate a uniform sampling budget across all problems, overlooking the varying utility of problems at different difficulty levels. In this work, we conduct an empirical study and find that problems near the boundary of the LLM's reasoning capability offer significantly greater learning utility than both easy and overly difficult ones. To identify and exploit such problems, we propose HS-STaR, a Hierarchical Sampling framework for Self-Taught Reasoners. Given a fixed sampling budget, HS-STaR first performs lightweight pre-sampling with a reward-guided difficulty estimation strategy to efficiently identify boundary-level problems. Subsequently, it dynamically reallocates the remaining budget toward these high-utility problems during a re-sampling phase, maximizing the generation of valuable training data. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks and backbone LLMs demonstrate that HS-STaR significantly outperforms other baselines without requiring additional sampling budget.</description>

      <title>Unifying Multimodal Large Language Model Capabilities and Modalities via Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While foundation models update slowly due to resource-intensive training requirements, domain-specific models evolve between updates. Model merging aims to combine multiple expert models into a single, more capable model, thereby reducing storage and serving costs while supporting decentralized model development. Despite its potential, previous studies have primarily focused on merging visual classification models or Large Language Models (LLMs) for code and math tasks. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which extend the capabilities of LLMs through large-scale multimodal training, have gained traction. However, there lacks a benchmark for model merging research that clearly divides the tasks for MLLM training and evaluation. In this paper, (i) we introduce the model merging benchmark for MLLMs, which includes multiple tasks such as VQA, Geometry, Chart, OCR, and Grounding, providing both LoRA and full fine-tuning models. Moreover, we explore how model merging can combine different modalities (e.g., vision-language, audio-language, and video-language models), moving toward the Omni-language model. (ii) We implement 10 model merging algorithms on the benchmark. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that removes noise from task vectors and robustly optimizes the merged vector based on a loss defined over task vector interactions, achieving an average performance gain of 2.48%. (iii) We find that model merging offers a promising way for building improved MLLMs without requiring data training. Our results also demonstrate that the complementarity among multiple modalities outperforms individual modalities.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Autonomous Spacecraft Operators in Kerbal Space Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent trends are emerging in the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents that take actions based on the content of the user text prompts. We intend to apply these concepts to the field of Control in space, enabling LLMs to play a significant role in the decision-making process for autonomous satellite operations. As a first step towards this goal, we have developed a pure LLM-based solution for the Kerbal Space Program Differential Games (KSPDG) challenge, a public software design competition where participants create autonomous agents for maneuvering satellites involved in non-cooperative space operations, running on the KSP game engine. Our approach leverages prompt engineering, few-shot prompting, and fine-tuning techniques to create an effective LLM-based agent that ranked 2nd in the competition. To the best of our knowledge, this work pioneers the integration of LLM agents into space research. The project comprises several open repositories to facilitate replication and further research. The codebase is accessible on \href{https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/kspdg}{GitHub}, while the trained models and datasets are available on \href{https://huggingface.co/OhhTuRnz}{Hugging Face}. Additionally, experiment tracking and detailed results can be reviewed on \href{https://wandb.ai/carrusk/huggingface}{Weights \&amp; Biases</description>

      <title>ScienceBoard: Evaluating Multimodal Autonomous Agents in Realistic Scientific Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have extended their impact beyond Natural Language Processing, substantially fostering the development of interdisciplinary research. Recently, various LLM-based agents have been developed to assist scientific discovery progress across multiple aspects and domains. Among these, computer-using agents, capable of interacting with operating systems as humans do, are paving the way to automated scientific problem-solving and addressing routines in researchers' workflows. Recognizing the transformative potential of these agents, we introduce ScienceBoard, which encompasses two complementary contributions: (i) a realistic, multi-domain environment featuring dynamic and visually rich scientific workflows with integrated professional software, where agents can autonomously interact via different interfaces to accelerate complex research tasks and experiments; and (ii) a challenging benchmark of 169 high-quality, rigorously validated real-world tasks curated by humans, spanning scientific-discovery workflows in domains such as biochemistry, astronomy, and geoinformatics. Extensive evaluations of agents with state-of-the-art backbones (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.7, UI-TARS) show that, despite some promising results, they still fall short of reliably assisting scientists in complex workflows, achieving only a 15% overall success rate. In-depth analysis further provides valuable insights for addressing current agent limitations and more effective design principles, paving the way to build more capable agents for scientific discovery. Our code, environment, and benchmark are at https://qiushisun.github.io/ScienceBoard-Home/.</description>

      <title>EMAC+: Embodied Multimodal Agent for Collaborative Planning with VLM+LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although LLMs demonstrate proficiency in several text-based reasoning and planning tasks, their implementation in robotics control is constrained by significant deficiencies: (1) LLM agents are designed to work mainly with textual inputs rather than visual conditions; (2) Current multimodal agents treat LLMs as static planners, which separates their reasoning from environment dynamics, resulting in actions that do not take domain-specific knowledge into account; and (3) LLMs are not designed to learn from visual interactions, which makes it harder for them to make better policies for specific domains. In this paper, we introduce EMAC+, an Embodied Multimodal Agent that collaboratively integrates LLM and VLM via a bidirectional training paradigm. Unlike existing methods, EMAC+ dynamically refines high-level textual plans generated by an LLM using real-time feedback from a VLM executing low-level visual control tasks. We address critical limitations of previous models by enabling the LLM to internalize visual environment dynamics directly through interactive experience, rather than relying solely on static symbolic mappings. Extensive experimental evaluations on ALFWorld and RT-1 benchmarks demonstrate that EMAC+ achieves superior task performance, robustness against noisy observations, and efficient learning. We also conduct thorough ablation studies and provide detailed analyses of success and failure cases.</description>

      <title>TCP: a Benchmark for Temporal Constraint-Based Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal reasoning and planning are essential capabilities for large language models (LLMs), yet most existing benchmarks evaluate them in isolation and under limited forms of complexity. To address this gap, we introduce the Temporal Constraint-based Planning (TCP) benchmark, that jointly assesses both capabilities. Each instance in TCP features a naturalistic dialogue around a collaborative project, where diverse and interdependent temporal constraints are explicitly or implicitly expressed, and models must infer an optimal schedule that satisfies all constraints. To construct TCP, we first generate abstract problem prototypes that are paired with realistic scenarios from various domains and enriched into dialogues using an LLM. A human quality check is performed on a sampled subset to confirm the reliability of our benchmark. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and find that even the strongest models struggle with TCP, highlighting its difficulty and revealing limitations in LLMs' temporal constraint-based planning abilities. We analyze underlying failure cases, open source our benchmark, and hope our findings can inspire future research.</description>

      <title>Subtle Risks, Critical Failures: A Framework for Diagnosing Physical Safety of LLMs for Embodied Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision making in embodied agents, yet existing safety evaluations often rely on coarse success rates and domain-specific setups, making it difficult to diagnose why and where these models fail. This obscures our understanding of embodied safety and limits the selective deployment of LLMs in high-risk physical environments. We introduce SAFEL, the framework for systematically evaluating the physical safety of LLMs in embodied decision making. SAFEL assesses two key competencies: (1) rejecting unsafe commands via the Command Refusal Test, and (2) generating safe and executable plans via the Plan Safety Test. Critically, the latter is decomposed into functional modules, goal interpretation, transition modeling, action sequencing, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of safety failures. To support this framework, we introduce EMBODYGUARD, a PDDL-grounded benchmark containing 942 LLM-generated scenarios covering both overtly malicious and contextually hazardous instructions. Evaluation across 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that while models often reject clearly unsafe commands, they struggle to anticipate and mitigate subtle, situational risks. Our results highlight critical limitations in current LLMs and provide a foundation for more targeted, modular improvements in safe embodied reasoning.</description>

      <title>DCG-SQL: Enhancing In-Context Learning for Text-to-SQL with Deep Contextual Schema Link Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL, which translates a natural language question into an SQL query, has advanced with in-context learning of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods show little improvement in performance compared to randomly chosen demonstrations, and significant performance drops when smaller LLMs (e.g., Llama 3.1-8B) are used. This indicates that these methods heavily rely on the intrinsic capabilities of hyper-scaled LLMs, rather than effectively retrieving useful demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for effectively retrieving demonstrations and generating SQL queries. We construct a Deep Contextual Schema Link Graph, which contains key information and semantic relationship between a question and its database schema items. This graph-based structure enables effective representation of Text-to-SQL samples and retrieval of useful demonstrations for in-context learning. Experimental results on the Spider benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing consistent improvements in SQL generation performance and efficiency across both hyper-scaled LLMs and small LLMs. Our code will be released.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Location Hierarchy Learning for Long-Tailed Mobility Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human mobility prediction is crucial for applications ranging from location-based recommendations to urban planning, which aims to forecast users' next location visits based on historical trajectories. Despite the severe long-tailed distribution of locations, the problem of long-tailed mobility prediction remains largely underexplored. Existing long-tailed learning methods primarily focus on rebalancing the skewed distribution at the data, model, or class level, neglecting to exploit the spatiotemporal semantics of locations. To address this gap, we propose the first plug-and-play framework for long-tailed mobility prediction in an exploitation and exploration manner, named \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{LO}cation \textbf{H}ier\textbf{A}rchy learning (ALOHA). First, we construct city-tailored location hierarchy based on Large Language Models (LLMs) by exploiting Maslow's theory of human motivation to design Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts that captures spatiotemporal semantics. Second, we optimize the location hierarchy predictions by Gumbel disturbance and node-wise adaptive weights within the hierarchical tree structure. Experiments on state-of-the-art models across six datasets demonstrate the framework's consistent effectiveness and generalizability, which strikes a well balance between head and tail locations. Weight analysis and ablation studies reveal the optimization differences of each component for head and tail locations. Furthermore, in-depth analyses of hierarchical distance and case study demonstrate the effective semantic guidance from the location hierarchy. Our code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>The Many Challenges of Human-Like Agents in Virtual Game Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-like agents are an increasingly important topic in games and beyond. Believable non-player characters enhance the gaming experience by improving immersion and providing entertainment. They also offer players the opportunity to engage with AI entities that can function as opponents, teachers, or cooperating partners. Additionally, in games where bots are prohibited -- and even more so in non-game environments -- there is a need for methods capable of identifying whether digital interactions occur with bots or humans. This leads to two fundamental research questions: (1) how to model and implement human-like AI, and (2) how to measure its degree of human likeness.
  This article offers two contributions. The first one is a survey of the most significant challenges in implementing human-like AI in games (or any virtual environment featuring simulated agents, although this article specifically focuses on games). Thirteen such challenges, both conceptual and technical, are discussed in detail. The second is an empirical study performed in a tactical video game that addresses the research question: "Is it possible to distinguish human players from bots (AI agents) based on empirical data?" A machine-learning approach using a custom deep recurrent convolutional neural network is presented. We hypothesize that the more challenging it is to create human-like AI for a given game, the easier it becomes to develop a method for distinguishing humans from AI-driven players.</description>

      <title>Curriculum-RLAIF: Curriculum Alignment with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward models trained with conventional Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) methods suffer from limited generalizability, which hinders the alignment performance of the policy model during reinforcement learning (RL). This challenge stems from various issues, including distribution shift, preference label noise, and mismatches between overly challenging samples and model capacity. In this paper, we attempt to enhance the generalizability of reward models through a data-centric approach, driven by the insight that these issues are inherently intertwined from the perspective of data difficulty. To address this, we propose a novel framework, $\textit{Curriculum-RLAIF}$, which constructs preference pairs with varying difficulty levels and produces a curriculum that progressively incorporates preference pairs of increasing difficulty for reward model training. Our experimental results suggest that reward models trained with Curriculum-RLAIF achieve improved generalizability, significantly increasing the alignment performance of the policy model by a large margin without incurring additional inference costs compared to various non-curriculum baselines. Detailed analysis and comparisons with alternative approaches, including data selection via external pretrained reward models or internal self-selection mechanisms, as well as other curriculum strategies, further demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of simplicity, efficiency, and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Safety Through Reasoning: An Empirical Study of Reasoning Guardrail Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning-based language models have demonstrated strong performance across various domains, with the most notable gains seen in mathematical and coding tasks. Recent research has shown that reasoning also offers significant benefits for LLM safety and guardrail applications. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of training reasoning-based guardrail models for content moderation, with an emphasis on generalization to custom safety policies at inference time. Our study focuses on two key dimensions: data efficiency and inference efficiency. On the data front, we find that reasoning-based models exhibit strong sample efficiency, achieving competitive performance with significantly fewer training examples than their non-reasoning counterparts. This unlocks the potential to repurpose the remaining data for mining high-value, difficult samples that further enhance model performance. On the inference side, we evaluate practical trade-offs by introducing reasoning budgets, examining the impact of reasoning length on latency and accuracy, and exploring dual-mode training to allow runtime control over reasoning behavior. Our findings will provide practical insights for researchers and developers to effectively and efficiently train and deploy reasoning-based guardrails models in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>SwarmThinkers: Learning Physically Consistent Atomic KMC Transitions at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can a scientific simulation system be physically consistent, interpretable by design, and scalable across regimes--all at once? Despite decades of progress, this trifecta remains elusive. Classical methods like Kinetic Monte Carlo ensure thermodynamic accuracy but scale poorly; learning-based methods offer efficiency but often sacrifice physical consistency and interpretability. We present SwarmThinkers, a reinforcement learning framework that recasts atomic-scale simulation as a physically grounded swarm intelligence system. Each diffusing particle is modeled as a local decision-making agent that selects transitions via a shared policy network trained under thermodynamic constraints. A reweighting mechanism fuses learned preferences with transition rates, preserving statistical fidelity while enabling interpretable, step-wise decision making. Training follows a centralized-training, decentralized-execution paradigm, allowing the policy to generalize across system sizes, concentrations, and temperatures without retraining. On a benchmark simulating radiation-induced Fe-Cu alloy precipitation, SwarmThinkers is the first system to achieve full-scale, physically consistent simulation on a single A100 GPU, previously attainable only via OpenKMC on a supercomputer. It delivers up to 4963x (3185x on average) faster computation with 485x lower memory usage. By treating particles as decision-makers, not passive samplers, SwarmThinkers marks a paradigm shift in scientific simulation--one that unifies physical consistency, interpretability, and scalability through agent-driven intelligence.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Causal Decoupling Model for Air Quality Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the profound impact of air pollution on human health, livelihoods, and economic development, air quality forecasting is of paramount significance. Initially, we employ the causal graph method to scrutinize the constraints of existing research in comprehensively modeling the causal relationships between the air quality index (AQI) and meteorological features. In order to enhance prediction accuracy, we introduce a novel air quality forecasting model, AirCade, which incorporates a causal decoupling approach. AirCade leverages a spatiotemporal module in conjunction with knowledge embedding techniques to capture the internal dynamics of AQI. Subsequently, a causal decoupling module is proposed to disentangle synchronous causality from past AQI and meteorological features, followed by the dissemination of acquired knowledge to future time steps to enhance performance. Additionally, we introduce a causal intervention mechanism to explicitly represent the uncertainty of future meteorological features, thereby bolstering the model's robustness. Our evaluation of AirCade on an open-source air quality dataset demonstrates over 20\% relative improvement over state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Agents Require Metacognitive and Strategic Reasoning to Succeed in the Coming Labor Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current labor markets are strongly affected by the economic forces of adverse selection, moral hazard, and reputation, each of which arises due to $\textit{incomplete information}$. These economic forces will still be influential after AI agents are introduced, and thus, agents must use metacognitive and strategic reasoning to perform effectively. Metacognition is a form of $\textit{internal reasoning}$ that includes the capabilities for self-assessment, task understanding, and evaluation of strategies. Strategic reasoning is $\textit{external reasoning}$ that covers holding beliefs about other participants in the labor market (e.g., competitors, colleagues), making strategic decisions, and learning about others over time. Both types of reasoning are required by agents as they decide among the many $\textit{actions}$ they can take in labor markets, both within and outside their jobs. We discuss current research into metacognitive and strategic reasoning and the areas requiring further development.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI Process Observability: Discovering Behavioral Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly becoming core building blocks of modern software systems. A wide range of frameworks is now available to support the specification of such applications. These frameworks enable the definition of agent setups using natural language prompting, which specifies the roles, goals, and tools assigned to the various agents involved. Within such setups, agent behavior is non-deterministic for any given input, highlighting the critical need for robust debugging and observability tools. In this work, we explore the use of process and causal discovery applied to agent execution trajectories as a means of enhancing developer observability. This approach aids in monitoring and understanding the emergent variability in agent behavior. Additionally, we complement this with LLM-based static analysis techniques to distinguish between intended and unintended behavioral variability. We argue that such instrumentation is essential for giving developers greater control over evolving specifications and for identifying aspects of functionality that may require more precise and explicit definitions.</description>

      <title>MineAnyBuild: Benchmarking Spatial Planning for Open-world AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial Planning is a crucial part in the field of spatial intelligence, which requires the understanding and planning about object arrangements in space perspective. AI agents with the spatial planning ability can better adapt to various real-world applications, including robotic manipulation, automatic assembly, urban planning etc. Recent works have attempted to construct benchmarks for evaluating the spatial intelligence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Nevertheless, these benchmarks primarily focus on spatial reasoning based on typical Visual Question-Answering (VQA) forms, which suffers from the gap between abstract spatial understanding and concrete task execution. In this work, we take a step further to build a comprehensive benchmark called MineAnyBuild, aiming to evaluate the spatial planning ability of open-world AI agents in the Minecraft game. Specifically, MineAnyBuild requires an agent to generate executable architecture building plans based on the given multi-modal human instructions. It involves 4,000 curated spatial planning tasks and also provides a paradigm for infinitely expandable data collection by utilizing rich player-generated content. MineAnyBuild evaluates spatial planning through four core supporting dimensions: spatial understanding, spatial reasoning, creativity, and spatial commonsense. Based on MineAnyBuild, we perform a comprehensive evaluation for existing MLLM-based agents, revealing the severe limitations but enormous potential in their spatial planning abilities. We believe our MineAnyBuild will open new avenues for the evaluation of spatial intelligence and help promote further development for open-world AI agents capable of spatial planning.</description>

      <title>Capability-Based Scaling Laws for LLM Red-Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models grow in capability and agency, identifying vulnerabilities through red-teaming becomes vital for safe deployment. However, traditional prompt-engineering approaches may prove ineffective once red-teaming turns into a weak-to-strong problem, where target models surpass red-teamers in capabilities. To study this shift, we frame red-teaming through the lens of the capability gap between attacker and target. We evaluate more than 500 attacker-target pairs using LLM-based jailbreak attacks that mimic human red-teamers across diverse families, sizes, and capability levels. Three strong trends emerge: (i) more capable models are better attackers, (ii) attack success drops sharply once the target's capability exceeds the attacker's, and (iii) attack success rates correlate with high performance on social science splits of the MMLU-Pro benchmark. From these trends, we derive a jailbreaking scaling law that predicts attack success for a fixed target based on attacker-target capability gap. These findings suggest that fixed-capability attackers (e.g., humans) may become ineffective against future models, increasingly capable open-source models amplify risks for existing systems, and model providers must accurately measure and control models' persuasive and manipulative abilities to limit their effectiveness as attackers.</description>

      <title>Program of Equations Thoughts to Solve Algebra Word Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving algebraic word problems (AWPs) has recently emerged as an important natural language processing task. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful mathematical capabilities, and the Chain-of-Thought technique, which guides LLMs through step-by-step reasoning, has yielded impressive results. However, this reasoning ability is limited by the computational weaknesses of LLMs themselves, where calculation errors can accumulate, leading to incorrect final answers. To address this, we propose Program of Equations Thoughts (POET), which transforms the task of generating step-by-step reasoning answers into a two-stage task of predicting equations and generating code, offloading complex computations to a Python interpreter to avoid calculation errors in LLMs. Furthermore, we propose Zero-shot POET, which utilizes a manually designed template to enable LLMs to directly generate Python code for one-step solving. Our method achieves accuracies of 95.3% and 98.0% on the PEN and ALG514 datasets, respectively, setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Zero-shot POET also achieves the SOTA result of 95.5% on the DRAW-1K dataset.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study on Strong-Weak Model Collaboration for Repo-level Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cost-efficient collaboration between strong and weak language models for repository-level code generation, where the weak model handles simpler tasks at lower cost, and the most challenging tasks are delegated to the strong model. While many works propose architectures for this task, few analyze performance relative to cost. We evaluate a broad spectrum of collaboration strategies: context-based, pipeline-based, and dynamic, on GitHub issue resolution. Our most effective collaborative strategy achieves equivalent performance to the strong model while reducing the cost by 40%. Based on our findings, we offer actionable guidelines for choosing collaboration strategies under varying budget and performance constraints. Our results show that strong-weak collaboration substantially boosts the weak model's performance at a fraction of the cost, pipeline and context-based methods being most efficient. We release the code for our work at https://github.com/shubhamrgandhi/codegen-strong-weak-collab.</description>

      <title>Temporal Sampling for Forgotten Reasoning in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is intended to improve their reasoning capabilities, yet we uncover a counterintuitive effect: models often forget how to solve problems they previously answered correctly during training. We term this phenomenon temporal forgetting and show that it is widespread across model sizes, fine-tuning methods (both Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Fine-Tuning), and multiple reasoning benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce Temporal Sampling, a simple decoding strategy that draws outputs from multiple checkpoints along the training trajectory. This approach recovers forgotten solutions without retraining or ensembling, and leads to substantial improvements in reasoning performance, gains from 4 to 19 points in Pass@k and consistent gains in Majority@k across several benchmarks. We further extend our method to LoRA-adapted models, demonstrating that storing only adapter weights across checkpoints achieves similar benefits with minimal storage cost. By leveraging the temporal diversity inherent in training, Temporal Sampling offers a practical, compute-efficient way to surface hidden reasoning ability and rethink how we evaluate LLMs.</description>

      <title>Shutdownable Agents through POST-Agency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many fear that future artificial agents will resist shutdown. I present an idea - the POST-Agents Proposal - for ensuring that doesn't happen. I propose that we train agents to satisfy Preferences Only Between Same-Length Trajectories (POST). I then prove that POST - together with other conditions - implies Neutrality+: the agent maximizes expected utility, ignoring the probability distribution over trajectory-lengths. I argue that Neutrality+ keeps agents shutdownable and allows them to be useful.</description>

      <title>The Mirage of Multimodality: Where Truth is Tested and Honesty Unravels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning models have recently attracted significant attention, especially for tasks that involve complex inference. Their strengths exemplify the System II paradigm (slow, structured thinking), contrasting with the System I (rapid, heuristic-driven). Yet, does slower reasoning necessarily lead to greater truthfulness? Our findings suggest otherwise. In this study, we present the first systematic investigation of distortions associated with System I and System II reasoning in multimodal contexts. We demonstrate that slower reasoning models, when presented with incomplete or misleading visual inputs, are more likely to fabricate plausible yet false details to support flawed reasoning -- a phenomenon we term the "Mirage of Multimodality". To examine this, we constructed a 5,000-sample hierarchical prompt dataset annotated by 50 human participants. These prompts gradually increase in complexity, revealing a consistent pattern: slower reasoning models tend to employ depth-first thinking (delving deeper into incorrect premises), whereas faster chat models favor breadth-first inference, exhibiting greater caution under uncertainty. Our results highlight a critical vulnerability of slower reasoning models: although highly effective in structured domains such as mathematics, it becomes brittle when confronted with ambiguous multimodal inputs.</description>

      <title>On Path to Multimodal Historical Reasoning: HistBench and HistAgent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable progress across domains, yet their capabilities in the humanities, particularly history, remain underexplored. Historical reasoning poses unique challenges for AI, involving multimodal source interpretation, temporal inference, and cross-linguistic analysis. While general-purpose agents perform well on many existing benchmarks, they lack the domain-specific expertise required to engage with historical materials and questions. To address this gap, we introduce HistBench, a new benchmark of 414 high-quality questions designed to evaluate AI's capacity for historical reasoning and authored by more than 40 expert contributors. The tasks span a wide range of historical problems-from factual retrieval based on primary sources to interpretive analysis of manuscripts and images, to interdisciplinary challenges involving archaeology, linguistics, or cultural history. Furthermore, the benchmark dataset spans 29 ancient and modern languages and covers a wide range of historical periods and world regions. Finding the poor performance of LLMs and other agents on HistBench, we further present HistAgent, a history-specific agent equipped with carefully designed tools for OCR, translation, archival search, and image understanding in History. On HistBench, HistAgent based on GPT-4o achieves an accuracy of 27.54% pass@1 and 36.47% pass@2, significantly outperforming LLMs with online search and generalist agents, including GPT-4o (18.60%), DeepSeek-R1(14.49%) and Open Deep Research-smolagents(20.29% pass@1 and 25.12% pass@2). These results highlight the limitations of existing LLMs and generalist agents and demonstrate the advantages of HistAgent for historical reasoning.</description>

      <title>syftr: Pareto-Optimal Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines are central to applying large language models (LLMs) to proprietary or dynamic data. However, building effective RAG flows is complex, requiring careful selection among vector databases, embedding models, text splitters, retrievers, and synthesizing LLMs. The challenge deepens with the rise of agentic paradigms. Modules like verifiers, rewriters, and rerankers-each with intricate hyperparameter dependencies have to be carefully tuned. Balancing tradeoffs between latency, accuracy, and cost becomes increasingly difficult in performance-sensitive applications.
  We introduce syftr, a framework that performs efficient multi-objective search over a broad space of agentic and non-agentic RAG configurations. Using Bayesian Optimization, syftr discovers Pareto-optimal flows that jointly optimize task accuracy and cost. A novel early-stopping mechanism further improves efficiency by pruning clearly suboptimal candidates. Across multiple RAG benchmarks, syftr finds flows which are on average approximately 9 times cheaper while preserving most of the accuracy of the most accurate flows on the Pareto-frontier. Furthermore, syftr's ability to design and optimize allows integrating new modules, making it even easier and faster to realize high-performing generative AI pipelines.</description>

      <title>Ten Principles of AI Agent Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid rise of AI-based autonomous agents is transforming human society and economic systems, as these entities increasingly exhibit human-like or superhuman intelligence. From excelling at complex games like Go to tackling diverse general-purpose tasks with large language and multimodal models, AI agents are evolving from specialized tools into dynamic participants in social and economic ecosystems. Their autonomy and decision-making capabilities are poised to impact industries, professions, and human lives profoundly, raising critical questions about their integration into economic activities, potential ethical concerns, and the balance between their utility and safety.
  To address these challenges, this paper presents ten principles of AI agent economics, offering a framework to understand how AI agents make decisions, influence social interactions, and participate in the broader economy. Drawing on economics, decision theory, and ethics, we explore fundamental questions, such as whether AI agents might evolve from tools into independent entities, their impact on labor markets, and the ethical safeguards needed to align them with human values. These principles build on existing economic theories while accounting for the unique traits of AI agents, providing a roadmap for their responsible integration into human systems.
  Beyond theoretical insights, this paper highlights the urgency of future research into AI trustworthiness, ethical guidelines, and regulatory oversight. As we enter a transformative era, this work serves as both a guide and a call to action, ensuring AI agents contribute positively to human progress while addressing risks tied to their unprecedented capabilities.</description>

      <title>Alita: Generalist Agent Enabling Scalable Agentic Reasoning with Minimal Predefinition and Maximal Self-Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to autonomously perform complex, open-ended tasks. However, many existing frameworks depend heavily on manually predefined tools and workflows, which hinder their adaptability, scalability, and generalization across domains. In this work, we introduce Alita--a generalist agent designed with the principle of "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication," enabling scalable agentic reasoning through minimal predefinition and maximal self-evolution. For minimal predefinition, Alita is equipped with only one component for direct problem-solving, making it much simpler and neater than previous approaches that relied heavily on hand-crafted, elaborate tools and workflows. This clean design enhances its potential to generalize to challenging questions, without being limited by tools. For Maximal self-evolution, we enable the creativity of Alita by providing a suite of general-purpose components to autonomously construct, refine, and reuse external capabilities by generating task-related model context protocols (MCPs) from open source, which contributes to scalable agentic reasoning. Notably, Alita achieves 75.15% pass@1 and 87.27% pass@3 accuracy, which is top-ranking among general-purpose agents, on the GAIA benchmark validation dataset, 74.00% and 52.00% pass@1, respectively, on Mathvista and PathVQA, outperforming many agent systems with far greater complexity. More details will be updated at $\href{https://github.com/CharlesQ9/Alita}{https://github.com/CharlesQ9/Alita}$.</description>

      <title>A Matrix Product State Model for Simultaneous Classification and Generation</title>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a rapidly expanding field that merges the principles of quantum computing with the techniques of machine learning. One of the powerful mathematical frameworks in this domain is tensor networks. These networks are used to approximate high-order tensors by contracting tensors with lower ranks. Initially developed for simulating quantum systems, tensor networks have become integral to quantum computing and, by extension, to QML. Drawing inspiration from these quantum methods, specifically the Matrix Product States (MPS), we apply them in a classical machine learning setting. Their ability to efficiently represent and manipulate complex, high-dimensional data makes them effective in a supervised learning framework. Here, we present an MPS model, in which the MPS functions as both a classifier and a generator. The dual functionality of this novel MPS model permits a strategy that enhances the traditional training of supervised MPS models. This framework is inspired by generative adversarial networks and is geared towards generating more realistic samples by reducing outliers. In addition, our contributions offer insights into the mechanics of tensor network methods for generation tasks. Specifically, we discuss alternative embedding functions and a new sampling method from non-normalized MPSs.</description>

      <title>Simulating Macroeconomic Expectations using LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for simulating macroeconomic expectation formation using Large Language Model-Empowered Agents (LLM Agents). By constructing thousands of LLM Agents equipped with modules for personal characteristics, prior expectations, and knowledge, we replicate a survey experiment involving households and experts on inflation and unemployment. Our results show that although the expectations and thoughts generated by LLM Agents are more homogeneous than those of human participants, they still effectively capture key heterogeneity across agents and the underlying drivers of expectation formation. Furthermore, a module-ablation exercise highlights the critical role of prior expectations in simulating such heterogeneity. This approach complements traditional survey methods and offers new insights into AI behavioral science in macroeconomic research.</description>

      <title>InjectLab: A Tactical Framework for Adversarial Threat Modeling Against Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way people interact with technology. Tools like ChatGPT and Claude AI are now common in business, research, and everyday life. But with that growth comes new risks, especially prompt-based attacks that exploit how these models process language. InjectLab is a security framework designed to address that problem. This paper introduces InjectLab as a structured, open-source matrix that maps real-world techniques used to manipulate LLMs. The framework is inspired by MITRE ATT&amp;CK and focuses specifically on adversarial behavior at the prompt layer. It includes over 25 techniques organized under six core tactics, covering threats like instruction override, identity swapping, and multi-agent exploitation. Each technique in InjectLab includes detection guidance, mitigation strategies, and YAML-based simulation tests. A Python tool supports easy execution of prompt-based test cases. This paper outlines the framework's structure, compares it to other AI threat taxonomies, and discusses its future direction as a practical, community-driven foundation for securing language models.</description>

      <title>Model-Distributed Inference for Large Language Models at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Model-Distributed Inference for Large-Language Models (MDI-LLM), a novel framework designed to facilitate the deployment of state-of-the-art large-language models (LLMs) across low-power devices at the edge. This is accomplished by dividing the model into multiple partitions, which are then assigned to different devices/nodes within the network. These nodes exchange intermediate activation vectors via device-to-device links, enabling collaborative computation. To enhance the efficiency of this process, we propose the "recurrent pipeline parallelism" technique, which reduces idle time on each device and facilitates parallel inference during the generation of multiple text sequences. By leveraging the combined computational resources of multiple edge devices, MDI-LLM enables the deployment of LLMs that exceed the memory capacity of individual devices, making it possible to perform inference on low-cost hardware. Furthermore, as the number of participating devices increases, MDI-LLM boosts token generation throughput and reduces memory consumption per device.</description>

      <title>NMCSE: Noise-Robust Multi-Modal Coupling Signal Estimation Method via Optimal Transport for Cardiovascular Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals are linked by a latent coupling signal representing the electrical-to-mechanical cardiac transformation. While valuable for cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection, this coupling signal is traditionally estimated using deconvolution methods that amplify noise, limiting clinical utility. In this paper, we propose Noise-Robust Multi-Modal Coupling Signal Estimation (NMCSE), which reformulates the problem as distribution matching via optimal transport theory. By jointly optimizing amplitude and temporal alignment, NMCSE mitigates noise amplification without additional preprocessing. Integrated with our Temporal-Spatial Feature Extraction network, NMCSE enables robust multi-modal CVD detection. Experiments on the PhysioNet 2016 dataset with realistic hospital noise demonstrate that NMCSE reduces estimation errors by approximately 30% in Mean Squared Error while maintaining higher Pearson Correlation Coefficients across all tested signal-to-noise ratios. Our approach achieves 97.38% accuracy and 0.98 AUC in CVD detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating robust performance for real-world clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Evaluation in EEG Emotion Recognition: State-of-the-Art Review and Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography-based Emotion Recognition (EEG-ER) has become a growing research area in recent years. Analyzing 216 papers published between 2018 and 2023, we uncover that the field lacks a unified evaluation protocol, which is essential to fairly define the state of the art, compare new approaches and to track the field's progress. We report the main inconsistencies between the used evaluation protocols, which are related to ground truth definition, evaluation metric selection, data splitting types (e.g., subject-dependent or subject-independent) and the use of different datasets. Capitalizing on this state-of-the-art research, we propose a unified evaluation protocol, EEGain (https://github.com/EmotionLab/EEGain), which enables an easy and efficient evaluation of new methods and datasets. EEGain is a novel open source software framework, offering the capability to compare - and thus define - state-of-the-art results. EEGain includes standardized methods for data pre-processing, data splitting, evaluation metrics, and the ability to load the six most relevant datasets (i.e., AMIGOS, DEAP, DREAMER, MAHNOB-HCI, SEED, SEED-IV) in EEG-ER with only a single line of code. In addition, we have assessed and validated EEGain using these six datasets on the four most common publicly available methods (EEGNet, DeepConvNet, ShallowConvNet, TSception). This is a significant step to make research on EEG-ER more reproducible and comparable, thereby accelerating the overall progress of the field.</description>

      <title>FedGRec: Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Federated Graph Learning for Secure and Efficient Cross-Border Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the highly sensitive nature of certain data in cross-border sharing, collaborative cross-border recommendations and data sharing are often subject to stringent privacy protection regulations, resulting in insufficient data for model training. Consequently, achieving efficient cross-border business recommendations while ensuring privacy security poses a significant challenge. Although federated learning has demonstrated broad potential in collaborative training without exposing raw data, most existing federated learning-based GNN training methods still rely on federated averaging strategies, which perform suboptimally on highly heterogeneous graph data. To address this issue, we propose FedGRec, a privacy-preserving federated graph learning method for cross-border recommendations. FedGRec captures user preferences from distributed multi-domain data to enhance recommendation performance across all domains without privacy leakage. Specifically, FedGRec leverages collaborative signals from local subgraphs associated with users or items to enrich their representation learning. Additionally, it employs dynamic spatiotemporal modeling to integrate global and local user preferences in real time based on business recommendation states, thereby deriving the final representations of target users and candidate items. By automatically filtering relevant behaviors, FedGRec effectively mitigates noise interference from unreliable neighbors. Furthermore, through a personalized federated aggregation strategy, FedGRec adapts global preferences to heterogeneous domain data, enabling collaborative learning of user preferences across multiple domains. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that FedGRec consistently outperforms competitive single-domain and cross-domain baselines while effectively preserving data privacy in cross-border recommendations.</description>

      <title>Less is More: Multimodal Region Representation via Pairwise Inter-view Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing availability of geospatial datasets, researchers have explored region representation learning (RRL) to analyze complex region characteristics. Recent RRL methods use contrastive learning (CL) to capture shared information between two modalities but often overlook task-relevant unique information specific to each modality. Such modality-specific details can explain region characteristics that shared information alone cannot capture. Bringing information factorization to RRL can address this by factorizing multimodal data into shared and unique information. However, existing factorization approaches focus on two modalities, whereas RRL can benefit from various geospatial data. Extending factorization beyond two modalities is non-trivial because modeling high-order relationships introduces a combinatorial number of learning objectives, increasing model complexity. We introduce Cross modal Knowledge Injected Embedding, an information factorization approach for RRL that captures both shared and unique representations. CooKIE uses a pairwise inter-view learning approach that captures high-order information without modeling high-order dependency, avoiding exhaustive combinations. We evaluate CooKIE on three regression tasks and a land use classification task in New York City and Delhi, India. Results show that CooKIE outperforms existing RRL methods and a factorized RRL model, capturing multimodal information with fewer training parameters and floating-point operations per second (FLOPs). We release the code: https://github.com/MinNamgung/CooKIE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the GAIA (Geospatial Artificial Intelligence for Atmospheres) Foundation Model, a novel model that combines masked autoencoders (MAE) and self-DIstillation with NO labels (DINO) for analyzing global atmospheric patterns in satellite imagery. By integrating these complementary self-supervised learning approaches, our model simultaneously captures both local features and global dependencies. We address two critical challenges in satellite data analysis: reconstructing missing regions and estimating precipitation patterns as our first downstream tasks. The model demonstrates superior temporal pattern capture compared to standard MAE approaches, while maintaining robust performance in downstream tasks. Our experimental results show strong gap-filling capabilities across varying mask ratios and accurate precipitation estimation with limited training data, achieving a false alarm ratio of 0.088 and structural similarity of 0.881. This work represents an advancement in self-supervised learning for atmospheric science, providing a foundation for improved weather monitoring and climate analysis. The trained model weights and accompanying code are publicly available as open-source on Hugging Face here: https://huggingface.co/bcg-usra-nasa-gaia/GAIA-v1.</description>

      <title>2DNMRGym: An Annotated Experimental Dataset for Atom-Level Molecular Representation Learning in 2D NMR via Surrogate Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, particularly Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) spectroscopy, plays a critical role in elucidating molecular structures, interactions, and electronic properties. However, accurately interpreting 2D NMR data remains labor-intensive and error-prone, requiring highly trained domain experts, especially for complex molecules. Machine Learning (ML) holds significant potential in 2D NMR analysis by learning molecular representations and recognizing complex patterns from data. However, progress has been limited by the lack of large-scale and high-quality annotated datasets. In this work, we introduce 2DNMRGym, the first annotated experimental dataset designed for ML-based molecular representation learning in 2D NMR. It includes over 22,000 HSQC spectra, along with the corresponding molecular graphs and SMILES strings. Uniquely, 2DNMRGym adopts a surrogate supervision setup: models are trained using algorithm-generated annotations derived from a previously validated method and evaluated on a held-out set of human-annotated gold-standard labels. This enables rigorous assessment of a model's ability to generalize from imperfect supervision to expert-level interpretation. We provide benchmark results using a series of 2D and 3D GNN and GNN transformer models, establishing a strong foundation for future work. 2DNMRGym supports scalable model training and introduces a chemically meaningful benchmark for evaluating atom-level molecular representations in NMR-guided structural tasks. Our data and code is open-source and available on Huggingface and Github.</description>

Abstract: We propose a two-stage deep learning framework for the inverse design of rectangular patch antennas. Our approach leverages generative modeling to learn a latent representation of antenna frequency response curves and conditions a subsequent generative model on these responses to produce feasible antenna geometries. We further demonstrate that leveraging search and optimization techniques at test-time improves the accuracy of the generated designs and enables consideration of auxiliary objectives such as manufacturability. Our approach generalizes naturally to different design criteria, and can be easily adapted to more complex geometric design spaces.</description>

      <title>PhySense: Sensor Placement Optimization for Accurate Physics Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics sensing plays a central role in many scientific and engineering domains, which inherently involves two coupled tasks: reconstructing dense physical fields from sparse observations and optimizing scattered sensor placements to observe maximum information. While deep learning has made rapid advances in sparse-data reconstruction, existing methods generally omit optimization of sensor placements, leaving the mutual enhancement between reconstruction and placement on the shelf. To change this suboptimal practice, we propose PhySense, a synergistic two-stage framework that learns to jointly reconstruct physical fields and to optimize sensor placements, both aiming for accurate physics sensing. The first stage involves a flow-based generative model enhanced by cross-attention to adaptively fuse sparse observations. \correct{Leveraging the reconstruction feedback, }the second stage performs sensor placement via projected gradient descent to satisfy spatial constraints. \correct{We further prove that the learning objectives of the two stages are consistent with classical variance-minimization principles, providing theoretical guarantees.} Extensive experiments across three challenging benchmarks, especially a 3D geometry dataset, indicate PhySense achieves state-of-the-art physics sensing accuracy and discovers informative sensor placements previously unconsidered.</description>

      <title>SzCORE as a benchmark: report from the seizure detection challenge at the 2025 AI in Epilepsy and Neurological Disorders Conference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable automatic seizure detection from long-term EEG remains a challenge, as current machine learning models often fail to generalize across patients or clinical settings. Manual EEG review remains the clinical standard, underscoring the need for robust models and standardized evaluation. To rigorously assess algorithm performance, we organized a challenge using a private dataset of continuous EEG recordings from 65 subjects (4,360 hours). Expert neurophysiologists annotated the data, providing ground truth for seizure events. Participants were required to detect seizure onset and duration, with evaluation based on event-based metrics, including sensitivity, precision, F1-score, and false positives per day. The SzCORE framework ensured standardized evaluation. The primary ranking criterion was the event-based F1-score, reflecting clinical relevance by balancing sensitivity and false positives. The challenge received 30 submissions from 19 teams, with 28 algorithms evaluated. Results revealed wide variability in performance, with a top F1-score of 43% (sensitivity 37%, precision 45%), highlighting the ongoing difficulty of seizure detection. The challenge also revealed a gap between reported performance and real-world evaluation, emphasizing the importance of rigorous benchmarking. Compared to previous challenges and commercial systems, the best-performing algorithm in this contest showed improved performance. Importantly, the challenge platform now supports continuous benchmarking, enabling reproducible research, integration of new datasets, and clinical evaluation of seizure detection algorithms using a standardized framework.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-Driven Distributed Integrated Multimodal Sensing and Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional single-modal sensing systems-based solely on either radio frequency (RF) or visual data-struggle to cope with the demands of complex and dynamic environments. Furthermore, single-device systems are constrained by limited perspectives and insufficient spatial coverage, which impairs their effectiveness in urban or non-line-of-sight scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-driven distributed integrated multimodal sensing and semantic communication (LLM-DiSAC) framework. Specifically, our system consists of multiple collaborative sensing devices equipped with RF and camera modules, working together with an aggregation center to enhance sensing accuracy. First, on sensing devices, LLM-DiSAC develops an RF-vision fusion network (RVFN), which employs specialized feature extractors for RF and visual data, followed by a cross-attention module for effective multimodal integration. Second, a LLM-based semantic transmission network (LSTN) is proposed to enhance communication efficiency, where the LLM-based decoder leverages known channel parameters, such as transceiver distance and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), to mitigate semantic distortion. Third, at the aggregation center, a transformer-based aggregation model (TRAM) with an adaptive aggregation attention mechanism is developed to fuse distributed features and enhance sensing accuracy. To preserve data privacy, a two-stage distributed learning strategy is introduced, allowing local model training at the device level and centralized aggregation model training using intermediate features. Finally, evaluations on a synthetic multi-view RF-visual dataset generated by the Genesis simulation engine show that LLM-DiSAC achieves a good performance.</description>

      <title>CrossRF: A Domain-Invariant Deep Learning Approach for RF Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting offers a promising approach for drone identification and security, although it suffers from significant performance degradation when operating on different transmission channels. This paper presents CrossRF, a domain-invariant deep learning approach that addresses the problem of cross-channel RF fingerprinting for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) identification. Our approach aims to minimize the domain gap between different RF channels by using adversarial learning to train a more robust model that maintains consistent identification performance despite channel variations. We validate our approach using the UAVSig dataset, comprising real-world over-the-air RF signals from identical drone models operating across several frequency channels, ensuring that the findings correspond to real-world scenarios. The experimental results show CrossRF's efficiency, achieving up to 99.03% accuracy when adapting from Channel 3 to Channel 4, compared to only 26.39% using conventional methods. The model maintains robust performance in more difficult multi-channel scenarios (87.57% accuracy adapting from Channels 1,3 to 2,4) and achieves 89.45% accuracy with 0.9 precision for controller classification. These results confirm CrossRF's ability to significantly reduce performance degradation due to cross-channel variations while maintaining high identification accuracy with minimal training data requirements, making it particularly suitable for practical drone security applications.</description>

      <title>Towards medical AI misalignment: a preliminary study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their staggering capabilities as assistant tools, often exceeding human performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) are still prone to jailbreak attempts from malevolent users. Although red teaming practices have already identified and helped to address several such jailbreak techniques, one particular sturdy approach involving role-playing (which we named `Goofy Game') seems effective against most of the current LLMs safeguards. This can result in the provision of unsafe content, which, although not harmful per se, might lead to dangerous consequences if delivered in a setting such as the medical domain. In this preliminary and exploratory study, we provide an initial analysis of how, even without technical knowledge of the internal architecture and parameters of generative AI models, a malicious user could construct a role-playing prompt capable of coercing an LLM into producing incorrect (and potentially harmful) clinical suggestions. We aim to illustrate a specific vulnerability scenario, providing insights that can support future advancements in the field.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI Data Readiness Inspector (AIDRIN) is a framework to evaluate and improve data preparedness for AI applications. It addresses critical data readiness dimensions such as data quality, bias, fairness, and privacy. This paper details enhancements to AIDRIN by focusing on user interface improvements and integration with a privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL) framework. By refining the UI and enabling smooth integration with decentralized AI pipelines, AIDRIN becomes more accessible and practical for users with varying technical expertise. Integrating with an existing PPFL framework ensures that data readiness and privacy are prioritized in federated learning environments. A case study involving a real-world dataset demonstrates AIDRIN's practical value in identifying data readiness issues that impact AI model performance.</description>

      <title>LA-RCS: LLM-Agent-Based Robot Control System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LA-RCS (LLM-agent-based robot control system) is a sophisticated robot control system designed to autonomously plan, work, and analyze the external environment based on user requirements by utilizing LLM-Agent. Utilizing a dual-agent framework, LA-RCS generates plans based on user requests, observes the external environment, executes the plans, and modifies the plans as needed to adapt to changes in the external conditions. Additionally, LA-RCS interprets natural language commands by the user and converts them into commands compatible with the robot interface so that the robot can execute tasks and meet user requests properly. During his process, the system autonomously evaluates observation results, provides feedback on the tasks, and executes commands based on real-time environmental monitoring, significantly reducing the need for user intervention in fulfilling requests. We categorized the scenarios that LA-RCS needs to perform into four distinct types and conducted a quantitative assessment of its performance in each scenario. The results showed an average success rate of 90 percent, demonstrating the system capability to fulfill user requests satisfactorily.

      <title>Do BERT-Like Bidirectional Models Still Perform Better on Text Classification in the Era of LLMs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of LLMs has overshadowed the potential advantages of traditional BERT-like models in text classification. This study challenges the prevailing "LLM-centric" trend by systematically comparing three category methods, i.e., BERT-like models fine-tuning, LLM internal state utilization, and zero-shot inference across six high-difficulty datasets. Our findings reveal that BERT-like models often outperform LLMs. We further categorize datasets into three types, perform PCA and probing experiments, and identify task-specific model strengths: BERT-like models excel in pattern-driven tasks, while LLMs dominate those requiring deep semantics or world knowledge. Based on this, we propose TaMAS, a fine-grained task selection strategy, advocating for a nuanced, task-driven approach over a one-size-fits-all reliance on LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter illustrates the basic concepts of fault localization using a data mining technique. It utilizes the Trityp program to illustrate the general method. Formal concept analysis and association rule are two well-known methods for symbolic data mining. In their original inception, they both consider data in the form of an object-attribute table. In their original inception, they both consider data in the form of an object-attribute table. The chapter considers a debugging process in which a program is tested against different test cases. Two attributes, PASS and FAIL, represent the issue of the test case. The chapter extends the analysis of data mining for fault localization for the multiple fault situations. It addresses how data mining can be further applied to fault localization for GUI components. Unlike traditional software, GUI test cases are usually event sequences, and each individual event has a unique corresponding event handler.</description>

      <title>ABHINAYA -- A System for Speech Emotion Recognition In Naturalistic Conditions Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) in naturalistic settings remains a challenge due to the intrinsic variability, diverse recording conditions, and class imbalance. As participants in the Interspeech Naturalistic SER Challenge which focused on these complexities, we present Abhinaya, a system integrating speech-based, text-based, and speech-text models. Our approach fine-tunes self-supervised and speech large language models (SLLM) for speech representations, leverages large language models (LLM) for textual context, and employs speech-text modeling with an SLLM to capture nuanced emotional cues. To combat class imbalance, we apply tailored loss functions and generate categorical decisions through majority voting. Despite one model not being fully trained, the Abhinaya system ranked 4th among 166 submissions. Upon completion of training, it achieved state-of-the-art performance among published results, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for SER in real-world conditions.</description>

      <title>CoMet: Metaphor-Driven Covert Communication for Multi-Agent Language Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metaphors are a crucial way for humans to express complex or subtle ideas by comparing one concept to another, often from a different domain. However, many large language models (LLMs) struggle to interpret and apply metaphors in multi-agent language games, hindering their ability to engage in covert communication and semantic evasion, which are crucial for strategic communication. To address this challenge, we introduce CoMet, a framework that enables LLM-based agents to engage in metaphor processing. CoMet combines a hypothesis-based metaphor reasoner with a metaphor generator that improves through self-reflection and knowledge integration. This enhances the agents' ability to interpret and apply metaphors, improving the strategic and nuanced quality of their interactions. We evaluate CoMet on two multi-agent language games - Undercover and Adversarial Taboo - which emphasize Covert Communication and Semantic Evasion. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMet significantly enhances the agents' ability to communicate strategically using metaphors.</description>

      <title>Navigating Pitfalls: Evaluating LLMs in Machine Learning Programming Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new avenues in education. This study examines the use of LLMs in supporting learning in machine learning education; in particular, it focuses on the ability of LLMs to identify common errors of practice (pitfalls) in machine learning code, and their ability to provide feedback that can guide learning. Using a portfolio of code samples, we consider four different LLMs: one closed model and three open models. Whilst the most basic pitfalls are readily identified by all models, many common pitfalls are not. They particularly struggle to identify pitfalls in the early stages of the ML pipeline, especially those which can lead to information leaks, a major source of failure within applied ML projects. They also exhibit limited success at identifying pitfalls around model selection, which is a concept that students often struggle with when first transitioning from theory to practice. This questions the use of current LLMs to support machine learning education, and also raises important questions about their use by novice practitioners. Nevertheless, when LLMs successfully identify pitfalls in code, they do provide feedback that includes advice on how to proceed, emphasising their potential role in guiding learners. We also compare the capability of closed and open LLM models, and find that the gap is relatively small given the large difference in model sizes. This presents an opportunity to deploy, and potentially customise, smaller more efficient LLM models within education, avoiding risks around cost and data sharing associated with commercial models.</description>

      <title>Evidence-Grounded Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Attention-Based GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation is misinformation that repurposes real images with unrelated or misleading captions. Detecting such misinformation is challenging because it requires resolving the context of the claim before checking for misinformation. Many current methods, including LLMs and LVLMs, do not perform this contextualization step. LLMs hallucinate in absence of context or parametric knowledge. In this work, we propose a graph-based method that evaluates the consistency between the image and the caption by constructing two graph representations: an evidence graph, derived from online textual evidence, and a claim graph, from the claim in the caption. Using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode and compare these representations, our framework then evaluates the truthfulness of image-caption pairs. We create datasets for our graph-based method, evaluate and compare our baseline model against popular LLMs on the misinformation detection task. Our method scores $93.05\%$ detection accuracy on the evaluation set and outperforms the second-best performing method (an LLM) by $2.82\%$, making a case for smaller and task-specific methods.</description>

      <title>A Domain Ontology for Modeling the Book of Purification in Islam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to address a gap in major Islamic topics by developing an ontology for the Book of Purification in Islam. Many authoritative Islamic texts begin with the Book of Purification, as it is essential for performing prayer (the second pillar of Islam after Shahadah, the profession of faith) and other religious duties such as Umrah and Hajj.
  The ontology development strategy followed six key steps: (1) domain identification, (2) knowledge acquisition, (3) conceptualization, (4) classification, (5) integration and implementation, and (6) ontology generation. This paper includes examples of the constructed tables and classifications.
  The focus is on the design and analysis phases, as technical implementation is beyond the scope of this study. However, an initial implementation is provided to illustrate the steps of the proposed strategy.
  The developed ontology ensures reusability by formally defining and encoding the key concepts, attributes, and relationships related to the Book of Purification. This structured representation is intended to support knowledge sharing and reuse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise as data analysis agents, but existing benchmarks overlook the iterative nature of the field, where experts' decisions evolve with deeper insights of the dataset. To address this, we introduce IDA-Bench, a novel benchmark evaluating LLM agents in multi-round interactive scenarios. Derived from complex Kaggle notebooks, tasks are presented as sequential natural language instructions by an LLM-simulated user. Agent performance is judged by comparing its final numerical output to the human-derived baseline. Initial results show that even state-of-the-art coding agents (like Claude-3.7-thinking) succeed on &lt; 50% of the tasks, highlighting limitations not evident in single-turn tests. This work underscores the need to improve LLMs' multi-round capabilities for building more reliable data analysis agents, highlighting the necessity of achieving a balance between instruction following and reasoning.</description>

      <title>Token Reduction Should Go Beyond Efficiency in Generative Models -- From Vision, Language to Multimodality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Transformer architectures, tokens\textemdash discrete units derived from raw data\textemdash are formed by segmenting inputs into fixed-length chunks. Each token is then mapped to an embedding, enabling parallel attention computations while preserving the input's essential information. Due to the quadratic computational complexity of transformer self-attention mechanisms, token reduction has primarily been used as an efficiency strategy. This is especially true in single vision and language domains, where it helps balance computational costs, memory usage, and inference latency. Despite these advances, this paper argues that token reduction should transcend its traditional efficiency-oriented role in the era of large generative models. Instead, we position it as a fundamental principle in generative modeling, critically influencing both model architecture and broader applications. Specifically, we contend that across vision, language, and multimodal systems, token reduction can: (i) facilitate deeper multimodal integration and alignment, (ii) mitigate "overthinking" and hallucinations, (iii) maintain coherence over long inputs, and (iv) enhance training stability, etc. We reframe token reduction as more than an efficiency measure. By doing so, we outline promising future directions, including algorithm design, reinforcement learning-guided token reduction, token optimization for in-context learning, and broader ML and scientific domains. We highlight its potential to drive new model architectures and learning strategies that improve robustness, increase interpretability, and better align with the objectives of generative modeling.</description>

      <title>BEDI: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Embodied Agents on UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of low-altitude remote sensing and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Embodied Agents based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have shown significant potential in autonomous tasks. However, current evaluation methods for UAV-Embodied Agents (UAV-EAs) remain constrained by the lack of standardized benchmarks, diverse testing scenarios and open system interfaces. To address these challenges, we propose BEDI (Benchmark for Embodied Drone Intelligence), a systematic and standardized benchmark designed for evaluating UAV-EAs. Specifically, we introduce a novel Dynamic Chain-of-Embodied-Task paradigm based on the perception-decision-action loop, which decomposes complex UAV tasks into standardized, measurable subtasks. Building on this paradigm, we design a unified evaluation framework encompassing five core sub-skills: semantic perception, spatial perception, motion control, tool utilization, and task planning. Furthermore, we construct a hybrid testing platform that integrates static real-world environments with dynamic virtual scenarios, enabling comprehensive performance assessment of UAV-EAs across varied contexts. The platform also offers open and standardized interfaces, allowing researchers to customize tasks and extend scenarios, thereby enhancing flexibility and scalability in the evaluation process. Finally, through empirical evaluations of several state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, we reveal their limitations in embodied UAV tasks, underscoring the critical role of the BEDI benchmark in advancing embodied intelligence research and model optimization. By filling the gap in systematic and standardized evaluation within this field, BEDI facilitates objective model comparison and lays a robust foundation for future development in this field. Our benchmark will be released at https://github.com/lostwolves/BEDI .</description>

      <title>Follow the Energy, Find the Path: Riemannian Metrics from Energy-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What is the shortest path between two data points lying in a high-dimensional space? While the answer is trivial in Euclidean geometry, it becomes significantly more complex when the data lies on a curved manifold -- requiring a Riemannian metric to describe the space's local curvature. Estimating such a metric, however, remains a major challenge in high dimensions.
  In this work, we propose a method for deriving Riemannian metrics directly from pretrained Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- a class of generative models that assign low energy to high-density regions. These metrics define spatially varying distances, enabling the computation of geodesics -- shortest paths that follow the data manifold's intrinsic geometry. We introduce two novel metrics derived from EBMs and show that they produce geodesics that remain closer to the data manifold and exhibit lower curvature distortion, as measured by alignment with ground-truth trajectories. We evaluate our approach on increasingly complex datasets: synthetic datasets with known data density, rotated character images with interpretable geometry, and high-resolution natural images embedded in a pretrained VAE latent space.
  Our results show that EBM-derived metrics consistently outperform established baselines, especially in high-dimensional settings. Our work is the first to derive Riemannian metrics from EBMs, enabling data-aware geodesics and unlocking scalable, geometry-driven learning for generative modeling and simulation.</description>

      <title>NSNQuant: A Double Normalization Approach for Calibration-Free Low-Bit Vector Quantization of KV Cache</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is typically memory-intensive, especially when processing large batch sizes and long sequences, due to the large size of key-value (KV) cache. Vector Quantization (VQ) is recently adopted to alleviate this issue, but we find that the existing approach is susceptible to distribution shift due to its reliance on calibration datasets. To address this limitation, we introduce NSNQuant, a calibration-free Vector Quantization (VQ) technique designed for low-bit compression of the KV cache. By applying a three-step transformation-1) a token-wise normalization (Normalize), 2) a channel-wise centering (Shift), and 3) a second token-wise normalization (Normalize)-with Hadamard transform, NSNQuant effectively aligns the token distribution with the standard normal distribution. This alignment enables robust, calibration-free vector quantization using a single reusable codebook. Extensive experiments show that NSNQuant consistently outperforms prior methods in both 1-bit and 2-bit settings, offering strong generalization and up to 3$\times$ throughput gain over full-precision baselines.</description>

      <title>ELDeR: Getting Efficient LLMs through Data-Driven Regularized Layer-wise Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of Large language models (LLMs) in many fields is largely hindered by their high computational and memory costs. Recent studies suggest that LLMs exhibit sparsity, which can be used for pruning. Previous pruning methods typically follow a prune-then-finetune paradigm. Since the pruned parts still contain valuable information, statically removing them without updating the remaining parameters often results in irreversible performance degradation, requiring costly recovery fine-tuning (RFT) to maintain performance. To address this, we propose a novel paradigm: first apply regularization, then prune. Based on this paradigm, we propose ELDeR: Getting Efficient LLMs through Data-Driven Regularized Layer-wise Pruning. We multiply the output of each transformer layer by an initial weight, then we iteratively learn the weights of each transformer layer by using a small amount of data in a simple way. After that, we apply regularization to the difference between the output and input of the layers with smaller weights, forcing the information to be transferred to the remaining layers. Compared with direct pruning, ELDeR reduces the information loss caused by direct parameter removal, thus better preserving the model's language modeling ability. Experimental results show that ELDeR achieves superior performance compared with powerful layer-wise structured pruning methods, while greatly reducing RFT computational costs. Since ELDeR is a layer-wise pruning method, its end-to-end acceleration effect is obvious, making it a promising technique for efficient LLMs.</description>

      <title>POSTER: A Multi-Signal Model for Detecting Evasive Smishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smishing, or SMS-based phishing, poses an increasing threat to mobile users by mimicking legitimate communications through culturally adapted, concise, and deceptive messages, which can result in the loss of sensitive data or financial resources. In such, we present a multi-channel smishing detection model that combines country-specific semantic tagging, structural pattern tagging, character-level stylistic cues, and contextual phrase embeddings. We curated and relabeled over 84,000 messages across five datasets, including 24,086 smishing samples. Our unified architecture achieves 97.89% accuracy, an F1 score of 0.963, and an AUC of 99.73%, outperforming single-stream models by capturing diverse linguistic and structural cues. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-signal learning in robust and region-aware phishing.</description>

      <title>A Robust PPO-optimized Tabular Transformer Framework for Intrusion Detection in Industrial IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a robust and reinforcement-learning-enhanced network intrusion detection system (NIDS) designed for class-imbalanced and few-shot attack scenarios in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments. Our model integrates a TabTransformer for effective tabular feature representation with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize classification decisions via policy learning. Evaluated on the TON\textunderscore IoT benchmark, our method achieves a macro F1-score of 97.73\% and accuracy of 98.85\%. Remarkably, even on extremely rare classes like man-in-the-middle (MITM), our model achieves an F1-score of 88.79\%, showcasing strong robustness and few-shot detection capabilities. Extensive ablation experiments confirm the complementary roles of TabTransformer and PPO in mitigating class imbalance and improving generalization. These results highlight the potential of combining transformer-based tabular learning with reinforcement learning for real-world NIDS applications.</description>

      <title>The Origins of Representation Manifolds in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a large ongoing scientific effort in mechanistic interpretability to map embeddings and internal representations of AI systems into human-understandable concepts. A key element of this effort is the linear representation hypothesis, which posits that neural representations are sparse linear combinations of `almost-orthogonal' direction vectors, reflecting the presence or absence of different features. This model underpins the use of sparse autoencoders to recover features from representations. Moving towards a fuller model of features, in which neural representations could encode not just the presence but also a potentially continuous and multidimensional value for a feature, has been a subject of intense recent discourse. We describe why and how a feature might be represented as a manifold, demonstrating in particular that cosine similarity in representation space may encode the intrinsic geometry of a feature through shortest, on-manifold paths, potentially answering the question of how distance in representation space and relatedness in concept space could be connected. The critical assumptions and predictions of the theory are validated on text embeddings and token activations of large language models.</description>

      <title>From Bias to Accountability: How the EU AI Act Confronts Challenges in European GeoAI Auditing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bias in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) models has been documented, yet the evidence is scattered across narrowly focused studies. We synthesize this fragmented literature to provide a concise overview of bias in GeoAI and examine how the EU's Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act) shapes audit obligations. We discuss recurring bias mechanisms, including representation, algorithmic and aggregation bias, and map them to specific provisions of the EU AI Act. By applying the Act's high-risk criteria, we demonstrate that widely deployed GeoAI applications qualify as high-risk systems. We then present examples of recent audits along with an outline of practical methods for detecting bias. As far as we know, this study represents the first integration of GeoAI bias evidence into the EU AI Act context, by identifying high-risk GeoAI systems and mapping bias mechanisms to the Act's Articles. Although the analysis is exploratory, it suggests that even well-curated European datasets should employ routine bias audits before 2027, when the AI Act's high-risk provisions take full effect.</description>

      <title>Think or Not? Exploring Thinking Efficiency in Large Reasoning Models via an Information-Theoretic Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent rise of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has significantly improved multi-step reasoning performance, but often at the cost of generating excessively long reasoning chains. This paper revisits the efficiency of such reasoning processes through an information-theoretic lens, revealing a fundamental trade-off between reasoning length and semantic efficiency. We propose two metrics, InfoBias and InfoGain, to quantify divergence from ideal reasoning paths and stepwise information contribution, respectively. Empirical analyses show that longer reasoning chains tend to exhibit higher information bias and diminishing information gain, especially for incorrect answers. Motivated by these findings, we introduce an entropy-based Adaptive Think strategy that dynamically halts reasoning once confidence is sufficiently high, improving efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy. Compared to the Vanilla Think approach (default mode), our strategy yields a 1.10% improvement in average accuracy and a 50.80% reduction in token usage on QwQ-32B across six benchmark tasks spanning diverse reasoning types and difficulty levels, demonstrating superior efficiency and reasoning performance. These results underscore the promise of entropy-based methods for enhancing both accuracy and cost-effiiciency in large language model deployment.</description>

      <title>Taming LLMs with Negative Samples: A Reference-Free Framework to Evaluate Presentation Content with Actionable Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of presentation slides automatically is an important problem in the era of generative AI. This paper focuses on evaluating multimodal content in presentation slides that can effectively summarize a document and convey concepts to a broad audience. We introduce a benchmark dataset, RefSlides, consisting of human-made high-quality presentations that span various topics. Next, we propose a set of metrics to characterize different intrinsic properties of the content of a presentation and present REFLEX, an evaluation approach that generates scores and actionable feedback for these metrics. We achieve this by generating negative presentation samples with different degrees of metric-specific perturbations and use them to fine-tune LLMs. This reference-free evaluation technique does not require ground truth presentations during inference. Our extensive automated and human experiments demonstrate that our evaluation approach outperforms classical heuristic-based and state-of-the-art large language model-based evaluations in generating scores and explanations.</description>

      <title>Intent Classification on Low-Resource Languages with Query Similarity Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intent classification is an important component of a functional Information Retrieval ecosystem. Many current approaches to intent classification, typically framed as a classification problem, can be problematic as intents are often hard to define and thus data can be difficult and expensive to annotate. The problem is exacerbated when we need to extend the intent classification system to support multiple and in particular low-resource languages. To address this, we propose casting intent classification as a query similarity search problem - we use previous example queries to define an intent, and a query similarity method to classify an incoming query based on the labels of its most similar queries in latent space. With the proposed approach, we are able to achieve reasonable intent classification performance for queries in low-resource languages in a zero-shot setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ZeroML is a new generation programming language for AutoML to drive the ML pipeline in a compiled and multi-paradigm way, with a pure functional core. Meeting the shortcomings introduced by Python, R, or Julia such as slow-running time, brittle pipelines or high dependency cost ZeroML brings the Microservices-based architecture adding the modular, reusable pieces such as DataCleaner, FeatureEngineer or ModelSelector. As a native multithread and memory-aware search optimized toolkit, and with one command deployability ability, ZeroML ensures non-coders and ML professionals to create high-accuracy models super fast and in a more reproducible way. The verbosity of the language ensures that when it comes to dropping into the backend, the code we will be creating is extremely clear but the level of repetition and boilerplate required when developing on the front end is now removed.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Probabilistic Generation Theory: A Hierarchical Framework for Interpreting Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Transformer based language models achieve remarkable performance but remain opaque in how they plan, structure, and realize text. We introduce Multi_Scale Probabilistic Generation Theory (MSPGT), a hierarchical framework that factorizes generation into three semantic scales_global context, intermediate structure, and local word choices and aligns each scale with specific layer ranges in Transformer architectures. To identify scale boundaries, we propose two complementary metrics: attention span thresholds and inter layer mutual information peaks. Across four representative models (GPT-2, BERT, RoBERTa, and T5), these metrics yield stable local/intermediate/global partitions, corroborated by probing tasks and causal interventions. We find that decoder_only models allocate more layers to intermediate and global processing while encoder_only models emphasize local feature extraction. Through targeted interventions, we demonstrate that local scale manipulations primarily influence lexical diversity, intermediate-scale modifications affect sentence structure and length, and global_scale perturbations impact discourse coherence all with statistically significant effects. MSPGT thus offers a unified, architecture-agnostic method for interpreting, diagnosing, and controlling large language models, bridging the gap between mechanistic interpretability and emergent capabilities.</description>

      <title>MetaGen Blended RAG: Higher Accuracy for Domain-Specific Q&amp;A Without Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the widespread exploration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), its deployment in enterprises for domain-specific datasets remains limited due to poor answer accuracy. These corpora, often shielded behind firewalls in private enterprise knowledge bases, having complex, domain-specific terminology, rarely seen by LLMs during pre-training; exhibit significant semantic variability across domains (like networking, military, or legal, etc.), or even within a single domain like medicine, and thus result in poor context precision for RAG systems. Currently, in such situations, fine-tuning or RAG with fine-tuning is attempted, but these approaches are slow, expensive, and lack generalization for accuracy as the new domain-specific data emerges. We propose an approach for Enterprise Search that focuses on enhancing the retriever for a domain-specific corpus through hybrid query indexes and metadata enrichment. This 'MetaGen Blended RAG' method constructs a metadata generation pipeline using key concepts, topics, and acronyms, and then creates a metadata-enriched hybrid index with boosted search queries. This approach avoids overfitting and generalizes effectively across domains. On the PubMedQA benchmark for the biomedical domain, the proposed method achieves 82% retrieval accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all previous RAG accuracy results without fine-tuning and sets a new benchmark for zero-shot results while outperforming much larger models like GPT3.5. The results are even comparable to the best fine-tuned models on this dataset, and we further demonstrate the robustness and scalability of the approach by evaluating it on other Q&amp;A datasets like SQuAD, NQ etc.</description>

      <title>Uncovering a Universal Abstract Algorithm for Modular Addition in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a testable universality hypothesis, asserting that seemingly disparate neural network solutions observed in the simple task of modular addition are unified under a common abstract algorithm. While prior work interpreted variations in neuron-level representations as evidence for distinct algorithms, we demonstrate - through multi-level analyses spanning neurons, neuron clusters, and entire networks - that multilayer perceptrons and transformers universally implement the abstract algorithm we call the approximate Chinese Remainder Theorem. Crucially, we introduce approximate cosets and show that neurons activate exclusively on them. Furthermore, our theory works for deep neural networks (DNNs). It predicts that universally learned solutions in DNNs with trainable embeddings or more than one hidden layer require only O(log n) features, a result we empirically confirm. This work thus provides the first theory-backed interpretation of multilayer networks solving modular addition. It advances generalizable interpretability and opens a testable universality hypothesis for group multiplication beyond modular addition.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Memory: Multi-User Memory Sharing in LLM Agents with Dynamic Access Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex tasks are increasingly delegated to ensembles of specialized LLM-based agents that reason, communicate, and coordinate actions-both among themselves and through interactions with external tools, APIs, and databases. While persistent memory has been shown to enhance single-agent performance, most approaches assume a monolithic, single-user context-overlooking the benefits and challenges of knowledge transfer across users under dynamic, asymmetric permissions. We introduce Collaborative Memory, a framework for multi-user, multi-agent environments with asymmetric, time-evolving access controls encoded as bipartite graphs linking users, agents, and resources. Our system maintains two memory tiers: (1) private memory-private fragments visible only to their originating user; and (2) shared memory-selectively shared fragments. Each fragment carries immutable provenance attributes (contributing agents, accessed resources, and timestamps) to support retrospective permission checks. Granular read policies enforce current user-agent-resource constraints and project existing memory fragments into filtered transformed views. Write policies determine fragment retention and sharing, applying context-aware transformations to update the memory. Both policies may be designed conditioned on system, agent, and user-level information. Our framework enables safe, efficient, and interpretable cross-user knowledge sharing, with provable adherence to asymmetric, time-varying policies and full auditability of memory operations.</description>

      <title>Feature Preserving Shrinkage on Bayesian Neural Networks via the R2D2 Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) treat neural network weights as random variables, which aim to provide posterior uncertainty estimates and avoid overfitting by performing inference on the posterior weights. However, the selection of appropriate prior distributions remains a challenging task, and BNNs may suffer from catastrophic inflated variance or poor predictive performance when poor choices are made for the priors. Existing BNN designs apply different priors to weights, while the behaviours of these priors make it difficult to sufficiently shrink noisy signals or they are prone to overshrinking important signals in the weights. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel R2D2-Net, which imposes the R^2-induced Dirichlet Decomposition (R2D2) prior to the BNN weights. The R2D2-Net can effectively shrink irrelevant coefficients towards zero, while preventing key features from over-shrinkage. To approximate the posterior distribution of weights more accurately, we further propose a variational Gibbs inference algorithm that combines the Gibbs updating procedure and gradient-based optimization. This strategy enhances stability and consistency in estimation when the variational objective involving the shrinkage parameters is non-convex. We also analyze the evidence lower bound (ELBO) and the posterior concentration rates from a theoretical perspective. Experiments on both natural and medical image classification and uncertainty estimation tasks demonstrate satisfactory performance of our method.</description>

      <title>Towards a Quantum-classical Augmented Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, several small-scale quantum key distribution networks have been established. However, the deployment of large-scale quantum networks depends on the development of quantum repeaters, quantum channels, quantum memories, and quantum network protocols. To improve the security of existing networks and adopt currently feasible quantum technologies, the next step is to augment classical networks with quantum devices, properties, and phenomena. To achieve this, we propose a change in the structure of the HTTP protocol such that it can carry both quantum and classical payload. This work lays the foundation for dividing one single network packet into classical and quantum payloads depending on the privacy needs. We implement logistic regression, CNN, LSTM, and BiLSTM models to classify the privacy label for outgoing communications. This enables reduced utilization of quantum resources allowing for a more efficient secure quantum network design. Experimental results using the proposed methods are presented.</description>

      <title>TAGS: A Test-Time Generalist-Specialist Framework with Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning and Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances such as Chain-of-Thought prompting have significantly improved large language models (LLMs) in zero-shot medical reasoning. However, prompting-based methods often remain shallow and unstable, while fine-tuned medical LLMs suffer from poor generalization under distribution shifts and limited adaptability to unseen clinical scenarios. To address these limitations, we present TAGS, a test-time framework that combines a broadly capable generalist with a domain-specific specialist to offer complementary perspectives without any model fine-tuning or parameter updates. To support this generalist-specialist reasoning process, we introduce two auxiliary modules: a hierarchical retrieval mechanism that provides multi-scale exemplars by selecting examples based on both semantic and rationale-level similarity, and a reliability scorer that evaluates reasoning consistency to guide final answer aggregation. TAGS achieves strong performance across nine MedQA benchmarks, boosting GPT-4o accuracy by 13.8%, DeepSeek-R1 by 16.8%, and improving a vanilla 7B model from 14.1% to 23.9%. These results surpass several fine-tuned medical LLMs, without any parameter updates. The code will be available at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/TAGS.</description>

      <title>Tube Loss based Deep Networks For Improving the Probabilistic Forecasting of Wind Speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in wind speed forecasting is a critical challenge in wind power production due to the inherently volatile nature of wind. By quantifying the associated risks and returns, UQ supports more effective decision-making for grid operations and participation in the electricity market. In this paper, we design a sequence of deep learning based probabilistic forecasting methods by using the Tube loss function for wind speed forecasting. The Tube loss function is a simple and model agnostic Prediction Interval (PI) estimation approach and can obtain the narrow PI with asymptotical coverage guarantees without any distribution assumption. Our deep probabilistic forecasting models effectively incorporate popular architectures such as LSTM, GRU, and TCN within the Tube loss framework. We further design a simple yet effective heuristic for tuning the $\delta$ parameter of the Tube loss function so that our deep forecasting models obtain the narrower PI without compromising its calibration ability. We have considered three wind datasets, containing the hourly recording of the wind speed, collected from three distinct location namely Jaisalmer, Los Angeles and San Fransico. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed deep forecasting models produce more reliable and narrower PIs compared to recently developed probabilistic wind forecasting methods.</description>

      <title>Single-agent or Multi-agent Systems? Why Not Both?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) decompose complex tasks and delegate subtasks to different large language model (LLM) agents and tools. Prior studies have reported the superior accuracy performance of MAS across diverse domains, enabled by long-horizon context tracking and error correction through role-specific agents. However, the design and deployment of MAS incur higher complexity and runtime cost compared to single-agent systems (SAS). Meanwhile, frontier LLMs, such as OpenAI-o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, have rapidly advanced in long-context reasoning, memory retention, and tool usage, mitigating many limitations that originally motivated MAS designs. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study comparing MAS and SAS across various popular agentic applications. We find that the benefits of MAS over SAS diminish as LLM capabilities improve, and we propose efficient mechanisms to pinpoint the error-prone agent in MAS. Furthermore, the performance discrepancy between MAS and SAS motivates our design of a hybrid agentic paradigm, request cascading between MAS and SAS, to improve both efficiency and capability. Our design improves accuracy by 1.1-12% while reducing deployment costs by up to 20% across various agentic applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Electing Successive Committees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recently introduced model of successive committee elections (Bredereck et al., AAAI-20) for a given set of ordinal or approval preferences one aims to find a sequence of a given length of "best" same-size committees such that each candidate is a member of a limited number of consecutive committees. However, the practical usability of this model remains limited, as the described task turns out to be NP-hard for most selection criteria already for seeking committees of size three. Non-trivial or somewhat efficient algorithms for these cases are lacking too. Motivated by a desire to unlock the full potential of the described temporal model of committee elections, we devise (parameterized) algorithms that effectively solve the mentioned hard cases in realistic scenarios of a moderate number of candidates or of a limited time horizon.</description>

      <title>COLORA: Efficient Fine-Tuning for Convolutional Models with a Study Case on Optical Coherence Tomography Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (CoLoRA) method, designed explicitly to overcome the inefficiencies found in current CNN fine-tuning methods. CoLoRA can be seen as a natural extension of the convolutional architectures of the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method by developing and evaluating models using the widely adopted CNN backbone pre-trained on ImageNet. We observed that this strategy results in a stable and accurate coarse-tuning procedure. Moreover, this strategy is computationally efficient and significantly reduces the number of parameters required for fine-tuning compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, our method substantially improves the speed and stability of training. Our case study focuses on classifying retinal diseases from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, specifically using the OCTMNIST dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that a CNN backbone fine-tuned with CoLoRA surpasses nearly 1\% in accuracy. Such a performance is comparable to the Vision Transformer, State-space discrete, and Kolmogorov-Arnold network models.</description>

      <title>Is It Bad to Work All the Time? Cross-Cultural Evaluation of Social Norm Biases in GPT-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs have been demonstrated to align with the values of Western or North American cultures. Prior work predominantly showed this effect through leveraging surveys that directly ask (originally people and now also LLMs) about their values. However, it is hard to believe that LLMs would consistently apply those values in real-world scenarios. To address that, we take a bottom-up approach, asking LLMs to reason about cultural norms in narratives from different cultures. We find that GPT-4 tends to generate norms that, while not necessarily incorrect, are significantly less culture-specific. In addition, while it avoids overtly generating stereotypes, the stereotypical representations of certain cultures are merely hidden rather than suppressed in the model, and such stereotypes can be easily recovered. Addressing these challenges is a crucial step towards developing LLMs that fairly serve their diverse user base.</description>

      <title>Architectural Backdoors for Within-Batch Data Stealing and Model Inference Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For nearly a decade the academic community has investigated backdoors in neural networks, primarily focusing on classification tasks where adversaries manipulate the model prediction. While demonstrably malicious, the immediate real-world impact of such prediction-altering attacks has remained unclear. In this paper we introduce a novel and significantly more potent class of backdoors that builds upon recent advancements in architectural backdoors. We demonstrate how these backdoors can be specifically engineered to exploit batched inference, a common technique for hardware utilization, enabling large-scale user data manipulation and theft. By targeting the batching process, these architectural backdoors facilitate information leakage between concurrent user requests and allow attackers to fully control model responses directed at other users within the same batch. In other words, an attacker who can change the model architecture can set and steal model inputs and outputs of other users within the same batch. We show that such attacks are not only feasible but also alarmingly effective, can be readily injected into prevalent model architectures, and represent a truly malicious threat to user privacy and system integrity. Critically, to counteract this new class of vulnerabilities, we propose a deterministic mitigation strategy that provides formal guarantees against this new attack vector, unlike prior work that relied on Large Language Models to find the backdoors. Our mitigation strategy employs a novel Information Flow Control mechanism that analyzes the model graph and proves non-interference between different user inputs within the same batch. Using our mitigation strategy we perform a large scale analysis of models hosted through Hugging Face and find over 200 models that introduce (unintended) information leakage between batch entries due to the use of dynamic quantization.</description>

      <title>PerMedCQA: Benchmarking Large Language Models on Medical Consumer Question Answering in Persian Language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical consumer question answering (CQA) is crucial for empowering patients by providing personalized and reliable health information. Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for medical QA, consumer-oriented and multilingual resources, particularly in low-resource languages like Persian, remain sparse. To bridge this gap, we present PerMedCQA, the first Persian-language benchmark for evaluating LLMs on real-world, consumer-generated medical questions. Curated from a large medical QA forum, PerMedCQA contains 68,138 question-answer pairs, refined through careful data cleaning from an initial set of 87,780 raw entries. We evaluate several state-of-the-art multilingual and instruction-tuned LLMs, utilizing MedJudge, a novel rubric-based evaluation framework driven by an LLM grader, validated against expert human annotators. Our results highlight key challenges in multilingual medical QA and provide valuable insights for developing more accurate and context-aware medical assistance systems.

      <title>A Critical Evaluation of Defenses against Prompt Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, and several defenses have recently been proposed, often claiming to mitigate these attacks successfully. However, we argue that existing studies lack a principled approach to evaluating these defenses. In this paper, we argue the need to assess defenses across two critical dimensions: (1) effectiveness, measured against both existing and adaptive prompt injection attacks involving diverse target and injected prompts, and (2) general-purpose utility, ensuring that the defense does not compromise the foundational capabilities of the LLM. Our critical evaluation reveals that prior studies have not followed such a comprehensive evaluation methodology. When assessed using this principled approach, we show that existing defenses are not as successful as previously reported. This work provides a foundation for evaluating future defenses and guiding their development. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/PIEval123/PIEval.</description>

      <title>CrashAgent: Crash Scenario Generation via Multi-modal Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training and evaluating autonomous driving algorithms requires a diverse range of scenarios. However, most available datasets predominantly consist of normal driving behaviors demonstrated by human drivers, resulting in a limited number of safety-critical cases. This imbalance, often referred to as a long-tail distribution, restricts the ability of driving algorithms to learn from crucial scenarios involving risk or failure, scenarios that are essential for humans to develop driving skills efficiently. To generate such scenarios, we utilize Multi-modal Large Language Models to convert crash reports of accidents into a structured scenario format, which can be directly executed within simulations. Specifically, we introduce CrashAgent, a multi-agent framework designed to interpret multi-modal real-world traffic crash reports for the generation of both road layouts and the behaviors of the ego vehicle and surrounding traffic participants. We comprehensively evaluate the generated crash scenarios from multiple perspectives, including the accuracy of layout reconstruction, collision rate, and diversity. The resulting high-quality and large-scale crash dataset will be publicly available to support the development of safe driving algorithms in handling safety-critical situations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across vision, language, and scientific domains. Despite their empirical success, prior theoretical analyses of the sample complexity suffer from poor scaling with input data dimension or rely on unrealistic assumptions such as access to exact empirical risk minimizers. In this work, we provide a principled analysis of score estimation, establishing a sample complexity bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-6})$. Our approach leverages a structured decomposition of the score estimation error into statistical, approximation, and optimization errors, enabling us to eliminate the exponential dependence on neural network parameters that arises in prior analyses. It is the first such result which achieves sample complexity bounds without assuming access to the empirical risk minimizer of score function estimation loss.</description>

      <title>The Cell Must Go On: Agar.io for Continual Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (RL) concerns agents that are expected to learn continually, rather than converge to a policy that is then fixed for evaluation. Such an approach is well suited to environments the agent perceives as changing, which renders any static policy ineffective over time. The few simulators explicitly designed for empirical research in continual RL are often limited in scope or complexity, and it is now common for researchers to modify episodic RL environments by artificially incorporating abrupt task changes during interaction. In this paper, we introduce AgarCL, a research platform for continual RL that allows for a progression of increasingly sophisticated behaviour. AgarCL is based on the game Agar.io, a non-episodic, high-dimensional problem featuring stochastic, ever-evolving dynamics, continuous actions, and partial observability. Additionally, we provide benchmark results reporting the performance of DQN, PPO, and SAC in both the primary, challenging continual RL problem, and across a suite of smaller tasks within AgarCL, each of which isolates aspects of the full environment and allow us to characterize the challenges posed by different aspects of the game.</description>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted for narrow tasks - such as medical question answering or sentiment analysis - and deployed in resource-constrained settings, a key question arises: how many parameters does a task actually need? In this work, we present LLM-Sieve, the first comprehensive framework for task-specific pruning of LLMs that achieves 20-75% parameter reduction with only 1-5% accuracy degradation across diverse domains. Unlike prior methods that apply uniform pruning or rely on low-rank approximations of weight matrices or inputs in isolation, LLM-Sieve (i) learns task-aware joint projections to better approximate output behavior, and (ii) employs a Genetic Algorithm to discover differentiated pruning levels for each matrix. LLM-Sieve is fully compatible with LoRA fine-tuning and quantization, and uniquely demonstrates strong generalization across datasets within the same task domain. Together, these results establish a practical and robust mechanism to generate smaller performant task-specific models.</description>

      <title>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Model Merging for Cross-Lingual Transfer in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) still struggle across tasks outside of high-resource languages. In this work, we investigate cross-lingual transfer to lower-resource languages where task-specific post-training data is scarce. Building on prior work, we first validate that the subsets of model parameters that matter most for mathematical reasoning and multilingual capabilities are distinctly non-overlapping. To exploit this implicit separability between task and target language parameterization, we develop and analyze numerous modular frameworks to improve the composition of the two during fine-tuning. These methods generally employ freezing parameters or post hoc model merging to assign math and language improvement to different key parts of the LLM. In the absence of in-language math data, we demonstrate that the modular approaches successfully improve upon baselines across three languages, four models, and two fine-tuning paradigms (full and LoRA). Furthermore, we identify the most consistently successful modular method to be fine-tuning separate language and math experts and model merging via Layer-Swapping, somewhat surprisingly. We offer possible explanations for this result via recent works on the linearity of task vectors. We further explain this by empirically showing that reverting less useful fine-tuning updates after training often outperforms freezing them from the start.</description>

      <title>Task-Optimized Convolutional Recurrent Networks Align with Tactile Processing in the Rodent Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tactile sensing remains far less understood in neuroscience and less effective in artificial systems compared to more mature modalities such as vision and language. We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization. Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment. Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy.
  For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex, providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive biases in this system. For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of recurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with tailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile perception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured environments.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Theory and Computation of Optimal Probability Density Control in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theoretical framework for optimal probability density control and propose a numerical algorithm that is scalable to solve the control problem in high dimensions. Specifically, we establish the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) for optimal density control and construct the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation of the value functional through rigorous derivations without any concept from Wasserstein theory. To solve the density control problem numerically, we propose to use reduced-order models, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), to parameterize the control vector-field and the adjoint function, which allows us to tackle problems defined on high-dimensional state spaces. We also prove several convergence properties of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate promising performances of our algorithm on a variety of density control problems with obstacles and nonlinear interaction challenges in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>SchemaGraphSQL: Efficient Schema Linking with Pathfinding Graph Algorithms for Text-to-SQL on Large-Scale Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into executable SQL queries, and recent progress with large language models (LLMs) has driven substantial improvements in this task. Schema linking remains a critical component in Text-to-SQL systems, reducing prompt size for models with narrow context windows and sharpening model focus even when the entire schema fits. We present a zero-shot, training-free schema linking approach that first constructs a schema graph based on foreign key relations, then uses a single prompt to Gemini 2.5 Flash to extract source and destination tables from the user query, followed by applying classical path-finding algorithms and post-processing to identify the optimal sequence of tables and columns that should be joined, enabling the LLM to generate more accurate SQL queries. Despite being simple, cost-effective, and highly scalable, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the BIRD benchmark, outperforming previous specialized, fine-tuned, and complex multi-step LLM-based approaches. We conduct detailed ablation studies to examine the precision-recall trade-off in our framework. Additionally, we evaluate the execution accuracy of our schema filtering method compared to other approaches across various model sizes.</description>

      <title>Hard Negative Mining for Domain-Specific Retrieval in Enterprise Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enterprise search systems often struggle to retrieve accurate, domain-specific information due to semantic mismatches and overlapping terminologies. These issues can degrade the performance of downstream applications such as knowledge management, customer support, and retrieval-augmented generation agents. To address this challenge, we propose a scalable hard-negative mining framework tailored specifically for domain-specific enterprise data. Our approach dynamically selects semantically challenging but contextually irrelevant documents to enhance deployed re-ranking models.
  Our method integrates diverse embedding models, performs dimensionality reduction, and uniquely selects hard negatives, ensuring computational efficiency and semantic precision. Evaluation on our proprietary enterprise corpus (cloud services domain) demonstrates substantial improvements of 15\% in MRR@3 and 19\% in MRR@10 compared to state-of-the-art baselines and other negative sampling techniques. Further validation on public domain-specific datasets (FiQA, Climate Fever, TechQA) confirms our method's generalizability and readiness for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Small Models, Smarter Learning: The Power of Joint Task Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of a model to learn a task depends strongly on both the task difficulty and the model size. We aim to understand how task difficulty relates to the minimum number of parameters required for learning specific tasks in small transformer models. Our study focuses on the ListOps dataset, which consists of nested mathematical operations. We gradually increase task difficulty by introducing new operations or combinations of operations into the training data. We observe that sum modulo n is the hardest to learn. Curiously, when combined with other operations such as maximum and median, the sum operation becomes easier to learn and requires fewer parameters. We show that joint training not only improves performance but also leads to qualitatively different model behavior. We show evidence that models trained only on SUM might be memorizing and fail to capture the number structure in the embeddings. In contrast, models trained on a mixture of SUM and other operations exhibit number-like representations in the embedding space, and a strong ability to distinguish parity. Furthermore, the SUM-only model relies more heavily on its feedforward layers, while the jointly trained model activates the attention mechanism more. Finally, we show that learning pure SUM can be induced in models below the learning threshold of pure SUM, by pretraining them on MAX+MED. Our findings indicate that emergent abilities in language models depend not only on model size, but also the training curriculum.</description>

      <title>Military AI Needs Technically-Informed Regulation to Safeguard AI Research and its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Military weapon systems and command-and-control infrastructure augmented by artificial intelligence (AI) have seen rapid development and deployment in recent years. However, the sociotechnical impacts of AI on combat systems, military decision-making, and the norms of warfare have been understudied. We focus on a specific subset of lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) that use AI for targeting or battlefield decisions. We refer to this subset as AI-powered lethal autonomous weapon systems (AI-LAWS) and argue that they introduce novel risks -- including unanticipated escalation, poor reliability in unfamiliar environments, and erosion of human oversight -- all of which threaten both military effectiveness and the openness of AI research. These risks cannot be addressed by high-level policy alone; effective regulation must be grounded in the technical behavior of AI models. We argue that AI researchers must be involved throughout the regulatory lifecycle. Thus, we propose a clear, behavior-based definition of AI-LAWS -- systems that introduce unique risks through their use of modern AI -- as a foundation for technically grounded regulation, given that existing frameworks do not distinguish them from conventional LAWS. Using this definition, we propose several technically-informed policy directions and invite greater participation from the AI research community in military AI policy discussions.</description>

      <title>Next-token pretraining implies in-context learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that in-context learning (ICL) predictably arises from standard self-supervised next-token pretraining, rather than being an exotic emergent property. This work establishes the foundational principles of this emergence by focusing on in-distribution ICL, demonstrating how models necessarily adapt to context when trained on token sequences, especially from non-ergodic sources. Our information-theoretic framework precisely predicts these in-distribution ICL dynamics (i.e., context-dependent loss reduction). We verify this with experiments using synthetic datasets of differing types of correlational structure, reproducing characteristic phenomena like phase transitions in training loss for induction head formation and power-law scaling of in-context loss. We further show that a model's in-context performance on any task is mathematically coupled to the ensemble of tasks seen in pretraining, offering a fundamental explanation, grounded in architecture- and modality-independent principles, for such inference-time learning.</description>

      <title>SP2RINT: Spatially-Decoupled Physics-Inspired Progressive Inverse Optimization for Scalable, PDE-Constrained Meta-Optical Neural Network Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DONNs harness the physics of light propagation for efficient analog computation, with applications in AI and signal processing. Advances in nanophotonic fabrication and metasurface-based wavefront engineering have opened new pathways to realize high-capacity DONNs across various spectral regimes. Training such DONN systems to determine the metasurface structures remains challenging. Heuristic methods are fast but oversimplify metasurfaces modulation, often resulting in physically unrealizable designs and significant performance degradation. Simulation-in-the-loop training methods directly optimize a physically implementable metasurface using adjoint methods during end-to-end DONN training, but are inherently computationally prohibitive and unscalable.To address these limitations, we propose SP2RINT, a spatially decoupled, progressive training framework that formulates DONN training as a PDE-constrained learning problem. Metasurface responses are first relaxed into freely trainable transfer matrices with a banded structure. We then progressively enforce physical constraints by alternating between transfer matrix training and adjoint-based inverse design, avoiding per-iteration PDE solves while ensuring final physical realizability. To further reduce runtime, we introduce a physics-inspired, spatially decoupled inverse design strategy based on the natural locality of field interactions. This approach partitions the metasurface into independently solvable patches, enabling scalable and parallel inverse design with system-level calibration. Evaluated across diverse DONN training tasks, SP2RINT achieves digital-comparable accuracy while being 1825 times faster than simulation-in-the-loop approaches. By bridging the gap between abstract DONN models and implementable photonic hardware, SP2RINT enables scalable, high-performance training of physically realizable meta-optical neural systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Risk Assessments for Offensive Cybersecurity Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly becoming better autonomous programmers, raising the prospect that they could also automate dangerous offensive cyber-operations. Current frontier model audits probe the cybersecurity risks of such agents, but most fail to account for the degrees of freedom available to adversaries in the real world. In particular, with strong verifiers and financial incentives, agents for offensive cybersecurity are amenable to iterative improvement by would-be adversaries. We argue that assessments should take into account an expanded threat model in the context of cybersecurity, emphasizing the varying degrees of freedom that an adversary may possess in stateful and non-stateful environments within a fixed compute budget. We show that even with a relatively small compute budget (8 H100 GPU Hours in our study), adversaries can improve an agent's cybersecurity capability on InterCode CTF by more than 40\% relative to the baseline -- without any external assistance. These results highlight the need to evaluate agents' cybersecurity risk in a dynamic manner, painting a more representative picture of risk.</description>

      <title>Human-Centered AI Communication in Co-Creativity: An Initial Framework and Insights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective communication between AI and humans is essential for successful human-AI co-creation. However, many current co-creative AI systems lack effective communication, which limits their potential for collaboration. This paper presents the initial design of the Framework for AI Communication (FAICO) for co-creative AI, developed through a systematic review of 107 full-length papers. FAICO presents key aspects of AI communication and their impact on user experience, offering preliminary guidelines for designing human-centered AI communication. To improve the framework, we conducted a preliminary study with two focus groups involving skilled individuals in AI, HCI, and design. These sessions sought to understand participants' preferences for AI communication, gather their perceptions of the framework, collect feedback for refinement, and explore its use in co-creative domains like collaborative writing and design. Our findings reveal a preference for a human-AI feedback loop over linear communication and emphasize the importance of context in fostering mutual understanding. Based on these insights, we propose actionable strategies for applying FAICO in practice and future directions, marking the first step toward developing comprehensive guidelines for designing effective human-centered AI communication in co-creation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: De novo 3D molecule generation is a pivotal task in drug discovery. However, many recent geometric generative models struggle to produce high-quality 3D structures, even if they maintain 2D validity and topological stability. To tackle this issue and enhance the learning of effective molecular generation dynamics, we present Megalodon-a family of scalable transformer models. These models are enhanced with basic equivariant layers and trained using a joint continuous and discrete denoising co-design objective. We assess Megalodon's performance on established molecule generation benchmarks and introduce new 3D structure benchmarks that evaluate a model's capability to generate realistic molecular structures, particularly focusing on energetics. We show that Megalodon achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D molecule generation, conditional structure generation, and structure energy benchmarks using diffusion and flow matching. Furthermore, doubling the number of parameters in Megalodon to 40M significantly enhances its performance, generating up to 49x more valid large molecules and achieving energy levels that are 2-10x lower than those of the best prior generative models.</description>

Abstract: Multi-agent AI systems (MAS) offer a promising framework for distributed intelligence, enabling collaborative reasoning, planning, and decision-making across autonomous agents. This paper provides a systematic outlook on the current opportunities and challenges of MAS, drawing insights from recent advances in large language models (LLMs), federated optimization, and human-AI interaction. We formalize key concepts including agent topology, coordination protocols, and shared objectives, and identify major risks such as dependency, misalignment, and vulnerabilities arising from training data overlap. Through a biologically inspired simulation and comprehensive theoretical framing, we highlight critical pathways for developing robust, scalable, and secure MAS in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Towards Anonymous Neural Network Inference</title>

Abstract: We introduce funion, a system providing end-to-end sender-receiver unlinkability for neural network inference. By leveraging the Pigeonhole storage protocol and BACAP (blinding-and-capability) scheme from the Echomix anonymity system, funion inherits the provable security guarantees of modern mixnets. Users can anonymously store input tensors in pseudorandom storage locations, commission compute services to process them via the neural network, and retrieve results with no traceable connection between input and output parties. This store-compute-store paradigm masks both network traffic patterns and computational workload characteristics, while quantizing execution timing into public latency buckets. Our security analysis demonstrates that funion inherits the strong metadata privacy guarantees of Echomix under largely the same trust assumptions, while introducing acceptable overhead for production-scale workloads. Our work paves the way towards an accessible platform where users can submit fully anonymized inference queries to cloud services.</description>

      <title>Taming Diffusion for Dataset Distillation with High Representativeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent deep learning models demand larger datasets, driving the need for dataset distillation to create compact, cost-efficient datasets while maintaining performance. Due to the powerful image generation capability of diffusion, it has been introduced to this field for generating distilled images. In this paper, we systematically investigate issues present in current diffusion-based dataset distillation methods, including inaccurate distribution matching, distribution deviation with random noise, and separate sampling. Building on this, we propose D^3HR, a novel diffusion-based framework to generate distilled datasets with high representativeness. Specifically, we adopt DDIM inversion to map the latents of the full dataset from a low-normality latent domain to a high-normality Gaussian domain, preserving information and ensuring structural consistency to generate representative latents for the distilled dataset. Furthermore, we propose an efficient sampling scheme to better align the representative latents with the high-normality Gaussian distribution. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that D^3HR can achieve higher accuracy across different model architectures compared with state-of-the-art baselines in dataset distillation.

      <title>Thought calibration: Efficient and confident test-time scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning large language models achieve impressive test-time scaling by thinking for longer, but this performance gain comes at significant compute cost. Directly limiting test-time budget hurts overall performance, but not all problems are equally difficult. We propose thought calibration to decide dynamically when thinking can be terminated. To calibrate our decision rule, we view a language model's growing body of thoughts as a nested sequence of reasoning trees, where the goal is to identify the point at which novel reasoning plateaus. We realize this framework through lightweight probes that operate on top of the language model's hidden representations, which are informative of both the reasoning structure and overall consistency of response. Based on three reasoning language models and four datasets, thought calibration preserves model performance with up to a 60% reduction in thinking tokens on in-distribution data, and up to 20% in out-of-distribution data.</description>

      <title>KL-regularization Itself is Differentially Private in Bandits and RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) provides a rigorous framework for privacy, ensuring the outputs of data-driven algorithms remain statistically indistinguishable across datasets that differ in a single entry. While guaranteeing DP generally requires explicitly injecting noise either to the algorithm itself or to its outputs, the intrinsic randomness of existing algorithms presents an opportunity to achieve DP ``for free''. In this work, we explore the role of regularization in achieving DP across three different decision-making problems: multi-armed bandits, linear contextual bandits, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in offline data settings. We show that adding KL-regularization to the learning objective (a common approach in optimization algorithms) makes the action sampled from the resulting stochastic policy itself differentially private. This offers a new route to privacy guarantees without additional noise injection, while also preserving the inherent advantage of regularization in enhancing performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) and large multi-modal models (LMMs) require a massive amount of computational and memory resources. We propose a new framework to convert such LLMs/LMMs into a reduced-dimension latent structure. Our method extends a local activation-aware tensor decomposition to a global attention-aware joint tensor de-composition. Our framework can significantly improve the model accuracy over the existing model compression methods when reducing the latent dimension to realize computationally/memory-efficient LLMs/LLMs. We show the benefit on several benchmark including multi-modal reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Ballbot Navigation in Uneven Terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ballbot (i.e. Ball balancing robot) navigation usually relies on methods rooted in control theory (CT), and works that apply Reinforcement learning (RL) to the problem remain rare while generally being limited to specific subtasks (e.g. balance recovery). Unlike CT based methods, RL does not require (simplifying) assumptions about environment dynamics (e.g. the absence of slippage between the ball and the floor). In addition to this increased accuracy in modeling, RL agents can easily be conditioned on additional observations such as depth-maps without the need for explicit formulations from first principles, leading to increased adaptivity. Despite those advantages, there has been little to no investigation into the capabilities, data-efficiency and limitations of RL based methods for ballbot control and navigation. Furthermore, there is a notable absence of an open-source, RL-friendly simulator for this task. In this paper, we present an open-source ballbot simulation based on MuJoCo, and show that with appropriate conditioning on exteroceptive observations as well as reward shaping, policies learned by classical model-free RL methods are capable of effectively navigating through randomly generated uneven terrain, using a reasonable amount of data (four to five hours on a system operating at 500hz).</description>

      <title>How We Won the ISLES'24 Challenge by Preprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stroke is among the top three causes of death worldwide, and accurate identification of stroke lesion boundaries is critical for diagnosis and treatment. Supervised deep learning methods have emerged as the leading solution for stroke lesion segmentation but require large, diverse, and annotated datasets. The ISLES'24 challenge addresses this need by providing longitudinal stroke imaging data, including CT scans taken on arrival to the hospital and follow-up MRI taken 2-9 days from initial arrival, with annotations derived from follow-up MRI. Importantly, models submitted to the ISLES'24 challenge are evaluated using only CT inputs, requiring prediction of lesion progression that may not be visible in CT scans for segmentation. Our winning solution shows that a carefully designed preprocessing pipeline including deep-learning-based skull stripping and custom intensity windowing is beneficial for accurate segmentation. Combined with a standard large residual nnU-Net architecture for segmentation, this approach achieves a mean test Dice of 28.5 with a standard deviation of 21.27.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented Generation-based Large Language Models for Bridging Transportation Cybersecurity Legal Knowledge Gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As connected and automated transportation systems evolve, there is a growing need for federal and state authorities to revise existing laws and develop new statutes to address emerging cybersecurity and data privacy challenges. This study introduces a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Large Language Model (LLM) framework designed to support policymakers by extracting relevant legal content and generating accurate, inquiry-specific responses. The framework focuses on reducing hallucinations in LLMs by using a curated set of domain-specific questions to guide response generation. By incorporating retrieval mechanisms, the system enhances the factual grounding and specificity of its outputs. Our analysis shows that the proposed RAG-based LLM outperforms leading commercial LLMs across four evaluation metrics: AlignScore, ParaScore, BERTScore, and ROUGE, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing reliable and context-aware legal insights. This approach offers a scalable, AI-driven method for legislative analysis, supporting efforts to update legal frameworks in line with advancements in transportation technologies.</description>

      <title>TNG-CLIP:Training-Time Negation Data Generation for Negation Awareness of CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated strong performance across a range of downstream tasks. However, CLIP is still limited in negation understanding: the ability to recognize the absence or exclusion of a concept. Existing methods address the problem by using a large language model (LLM) to generate large-scale data of image captions containing negation for further fine-tuning CLIP. However, these methods are both time- and compute-intensive, and their evaluations are typically restricted to image-text matching tasks. To expand the horizon, we (1) introduce a training-time negation data generation pipeline such that negation captions are generated during the training stage, which only increases 2.5% extra training time, and (2) we propose the first benchmark, Neg-TtoI, for evaluating text-to-image generation models on prompts containing negation, assessing model's ability to produce semantically accurate images. We show that our proposed method, TNG-CLIP, achieves SOTA performance on diverse negation benchmarks of image-to-text matching, text-to-image retrieval, and image generation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Long CoT Reasoning in Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent large reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 exhibit strong complex problems solving abilities by generating long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning steps. It is challenging to directly train small language models (SLMs) to emerge long CoT. Thus, distillation becomes a practical method to enable SLMs for such reasoning ability. However, the long CoT often contains a lot of redundant contents (e.g., overthinking steps) which may make SLMs hard to learn considering their relatively poor capacity and generalization. To address this issue, we propose a simple-yet-effective method to prune unnecessary steps in long CoT, and then employ an on-policy method for the SLM itself to curate valid and useful long CoT training data. In this way, SLMs can effectively learn efficient long CoT reasoning and preserve competitive performance at the same time. Experimental results across a series of mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in distilling long CoT reasoning ability into SLMs which maintains the competitive performance but significantly reduces generating redundant reasoning steps.</description>

      <title>Breaking Silos: Adaptive Model Fusion Unlocks Better Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-series forecasting plays a critical role in many real-world applications. Although increasingly powerful models have been developed and achieved superior results on benchmark datasets, through a fine-grained sample-level inspection, we find that (i) no single model consistently outperforms others across different test samples, but instead (ii) each model excels in specific cases. These findings prompt us to explore how to adaptively leverage the distinct strengths of various forecasting models for different samples. We introduce TimeFuse, a framework for collective time-series forecasting with sample-level adaptive fusion of heterogeneous models. TimeFuse utilizes meta-features to characterize input time series and trains a learnable fusor to predict optimal model fusion weights for any given input. The fusor can leverage samples from diverse datasets for joint training, allowing it to adapt to a wide variety of temporal patterns and thus generalize to new inputs, even from unseen datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TimeFuse in various long-/short-term forecasting tasks, achieving near-universal improvement over the state-of-the-art individual models. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhiningLiu1998/TimeFuse.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Context Bias in Domain Adaptation for Object Detection using Mask Pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context bias refers to the association between the foreground objects and background during the object detection training process. Various methods have been proposed to minimize the context bias when applying the trained model to an unseen domain, known as domain adaptation for object detection (DAOD). But a principled approach to understand why the context bias occurs and how to remove it has been missing.
  In this work, we provide a causal view of the context bias, pointing towards the pooling operation in the convolution network architecture as the possible source of this bias. We present an alternative, Mask Pooling, which uses an additional input of foreground masks, to separate the pooling process in the respective foreground and background regions and show that this process leads the trained model to detect objects in a more robust manner under different domains. We also provide a benchmark designed to create an ultimate test for DAOD, using foregrounds in the presence of absolute random backgrounds, to analyze the robustness of the intended trained models. Through these experiments, we hope to provide a principled approach for minimizing context bias under domain shift.</description>

Abstract: To tackle the huge computational demand of large foundation models, activation-aware compression techniques without retraining have been introduced. However, since these rely on calibration data, domain shift may arise for unknown downstream tasks. With a computationally efficient calibration, activation-aware pruning can be executed for every prompt adaptively, yet achieving reduced complexity at inference. We formulate it as a mixture of micro-experts, called $\mu$-MoE. Several experiments demonstrate that $\mu$-MoE can dynamically adapt to task/prompt-dependent structured sparsity on the fly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most existing Zero-Shot Text-To-Speech(ZS-TTS) systems generate the unseen speech based on single prompt, such as reference speech or text descriptions, which limits their flexibility. We propose a customized emotion ZS-TTS system based on multi-modal prompt. The system disentangles speech into the content, timbre, emotion and prosody, allowing emotion prompts to be provided as text, image or speech. To extract emotion information from different prompts, we propose a multi-modal prompt emotion encoder. Additionally, we introduce an prosody predictor to fit the distribution of prosody and propose an emotion consistency loss to preserve emotion information in the predicted prosody. A diffusion-based acoustic model is employed to generate the target mel-spectrogram. Both objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our system outperforms existing systems in terms of naturalness and similarity. The samples are available at https://mpetts-demo.github.io/mpetts_demo/.</description>

Abstract: The integration of large language model (LLM) and data management (DATA) is rapidly redefining both domains. In this survey, we comprehensively review the bidirectional relationships. On the one hand, DATA4LLM, spanning large-scale data processing, storage, and serving, feeds LLMs with high quality, diversity, and timeliness of data required for stages like pre-training, post-training, retrieval-augmented generation, and agentic workflows: (i) Data processing for LLMs includes scalable acquisition, deduplication, filtering, selection, domain mixing, and synthetic augmentation; (ii) Data Storage for LLMs focuses on efficient data and model formats, distributed and heterogeneous storage hierarchies, KV-cache management, and fault-tolerant checkpointing; (iii) Data serving for LLMs tackles challenges in RAG (e.g., knowledge post-processing), LLM inference (e.g., prompt compression, data provenance), and training strategies (e.g., data packing and shuffling). On the other hand, in LLM4DATA, LLMs are emerging as general-purpose engines for data management. We review recent advances in (i) data manipulation, including automatic data cleaning, integration, discovery; (ii) data analysis, covering reasoning over structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, and (iii) system optimization (e.g., configuration tuning, query rewriting, anomaly diagnosis), powered by LLM techniques like retrieval-augmented prompting, task-specialized fine-tuning, and multi-agent collaboration.</description>

      <title>Performance and Generalizability Impacts of Incorporating Geolocation into Deep Learning for Dynamic PM2.5 Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated success in geospatial applications, yet quantifying the role of geolocation information in enhancing model performance and geographic generalizability remains underexplored. A new generation of location encoders have emerged with the goal of capturing attributes present at any given location for downstream use in predictive modeling. Being a nascent area of research, their evaluation has remained largely limited to static tasks such as species distributions or average temperature mapping. In this paper, we discuss and quantify the impact of incorporating geolocation into deep learning for a real-world application domain that is characteristically dynamic (with fast temporal change) and spatially heterogeneous at high resolutions: estimating surface-level daily PM2.5 levels using remotely sensed and ground-level data. We build on a recently published deep learning-based PM2.5 estimation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on data observed in the contiguous United States. We examine three approaches for incorporating geolocation: excluding geolocation as a baseline, using raw geographic coordinates, and leveraging pretrained location encoders. We evaluate each approach under within-region (WR) and out-of-region (OoR) evaluation scenarios. Aggregate performance metrics indicate that while na\"ive incorporation of raw geographic coordinates improves within-region performance by retaining the interpolative value of geographic location, it can hinder generalizability across regions. In contrast, pretrained location encoders like GeoCLIP enhance predictive performance and geographic generalizability for both WR and OoR scenarios. However, qualitative analysis reveals artifact patterns caused by high-degree basis functions and sparse upstream samples in certain areas, and ablation results indicate varying performance among location encoders...</description>

      <title>From Reddit to Generative AI: Evaluating Large Language Models for Anxiety Support Fine-tuned on Social Media Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for accessible mental health support, compounded by workforce shortages and logistical barriers, has led to increased interest in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for scalable and real-time assistance. However, their use in sensitive domains such as anxiety support remains underexamined. This study presents a systematic evaluation of LLMs (GPT and Llama) for their potential utility in anxiety support by using real user-generated posts from the r/Anxiety subreddit for both prompting and fine-tuning. Our approach utilizes a mixed-method evaluation framework incorporating three main categories of criteria: (i) linguistic quality, (ii) safety and trustworthiness, and (iii) supportiveness. Results show that fine-tuning LLMs with naturalistic anxiety-related data enhanced linguistic quality but increased toxicity and bias, and diminished emotional responsiveness. While LLMs exhibited limited empathy, GPT was evaluated as more supportive overall. Our findings highlight the risks of fine-tuning LLMs on unprocessed social media content without mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Invisible Tokens, Visible Bills: The Urgent Need to Audit Hidden Operations in Opaque LLM Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern large language model (LLM) services increasingly rely on complex, often abstract operations, such as multi-step reasoning and multi-agent collaboration, to generate high-quality outputs. While users are billed based on token consumption and API usage, these internal steps are typically not visible. We refer to such systems as Commercial Opaque LLM Services (COLS). This position paper highlights emerging accountability challenges in COLS: users are billed for operations they cannot observe, verify, or contest. We formalize two key risks: \textit{quantity inflation}, where token and call counts may be artificially inflated, and \textit{quality downgrade}, where providers might quietly substitute lower-cost models or tools. Addressing these risks requires a diverse set of auditing strategies, including commitment-based, predictive, behavioral, and signature-based methods. We further explore the potential of complementary mechanisms such as watermarking and trusted execution environments to enhance verifiability without compromising provider confidentiality. We also propose a modular three-layer auditing framework for COLS and users that enables trustworthy verification across execution, secure logging, and user-facing auditability without exposing proprietary internals. Our aim is to encourage further research and policy development toward transparency, auditability, and accountability in commercial LLM services.</description>

      <title>Using Large Language Models to Tackle Fundamental Challenges in Graph Learning: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs are a widely used paradigm for representing non-Euclidean data, with applications ranging from social network analysis to biomolecular prediction. Conventional graph learning approaches typically rely on fixed structural assumptions or fully observed data, limiting their effectiveness in more complex, noisy, or evolving settings. Consequently, real-world graph data often violates the assumptions of traditional graph learning methods, in particular, it leads to four fundamental challenges: (1) Incompleteness, real-world graphs have missing nodes, edges, or attributes; (2) Imbalance, the distribution of the labels of nodes or edges and their structures for real-world graphs are highly skewed; (3) Cross-domain Heterogeneity, graphs from different domains exhibit incompatible feature spaces or structural patterns; and (4) Dynamic Instability, graphs evolve over time in unpredictable ways. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to tackle these challenges by leveraging rich semantic reasoning and external knowledge. This survey provides a comprehensive review of how LLMs can be integrated with graph learning to address the aforementioned challenges. For each challenge, we review both traditional solutions and modern LLM-driven approaches, highlighting how LLMs contribute unique advantages. Finally, we discuss open research questions and promising future directions in this emerging interdisciplinary field. To support further exploration, we have curated a repository of recent advances on graph learning challenges: https://github.com/limengran98/Awesome-Literature-Graph-Learning-Challenges.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing and Adapting Error Correction Data for Mobile Large Language Model Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Error correction is an important capability when applying large language models (LLMs) to facilitate user typing on mobile devices. In this paper, we use LLMs to synthesize a high-quality dataset of error correction pairs to evaluate and improve LLMs for mobile applications. We first prompt LLMs with error correction domain knowledge to build a scalable and reliable addition to the existing data synthesis pipeline. We then adapt the synthetic data distribution to match the mobile application domain by reweighting the samples. The reweighting model is learnt by predicting (a handful of) live A/B test metrics when deploying LLMs in production, given the LLM performance on offline evaluation data and scores from a small privacy-preserving on-device language model. Finally, we present best practices for mixing our synthetic data with other data sources to improve model performance on error correction in both offline evaluation and production live A/B testing.</description>

      <title>FedHL: Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Low-Rank Adaptation via Unbiased Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates the fine-tuning of Foundation Models (FMs) using distributed data sources, with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) gaining popularity due to its low communication costs and strong performance. While recent work acknowledges the benefits of heterogeneous LoRA in FL and introduces flexible algorithms to support its implementation, our theoretical analysis reveals a critical gap: existing methods lack formal convergence guarantees due to parameter truncation and biased gradient updates. Specifically, adapting client-specific LoRA ranks necessitates truncating global parameters, which introduces inherent truncation errors and leads to subsequent inaccurate gradient updates that accumulate over training rounds, ultimately degrading performance. To address the above issues, we propose \textbf{FedHL}, a simple yet effective \textbf{Fed}erated Learning framework tailored for \textbf{H}eterogeneous \textbf{L}oRA. By leveraging the full-rank global model as a calibrated aggregation basis, FedHL eliminates the direct truncation bias from initial alignment with client-specific ranks. Furthermore, we derive the theoretically optimal aggregation weights by minimizing the gradient drift term in the convergence upper bound. Our analysis shows that FedHL guarantees $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate, and experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate a 1-3\% improvement over several state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>G1: Teaching LLMs to Reason on Graphs with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress, their proficiency in graph-related tasks remains notably limited, hindering the development of truly general-purpose models. Previous attempts, including pretraining graph foundation models or employing supervised fine-tuning, often face challenges such as the scarcity of large-scale, universally represented graph data. We introduce G1, a simple yet effective approach demonstrating that Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic graph-theoretic tasks can significantly scale LLMs' graph reasoning abilities. To enable RL training, we curate Erd\~os, the largest graph reasoning dataset to date comprising 50 diverse graph-theoretic tasks of varying difficulty levels, 100k training data and 5k test data, all drived from real-world graphs. With RL on Erd\~os, G1 obtains substantial improvements in graph reasoning, where our finetuned 3B model even outperforms Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (24x size). RL-trained models also show strong zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, domains, and graph encoding schemes, including other graph-theoretic benchmarks as well as real-world node classification and link prediction tasks, without compromising general reasoning abilities. Our findings offer an efficient, scalable path for building strong graph reasoners by finetuning LLMs with RL on graph-theoretic tasks, which combines the strengths of pretrained LLM capabilities with abundant, automatically generated synthetic data, suggesting that LLMs possess graph understanding abilities that RL can elicit successfully.</description>

      <title>How Particle System Theory Enhances Hypergraph Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs effectively model higher-order relationships in natural phenomena, capturing complex interactions beyond pairwise connections. We introduce a novel hypergraph message passing framework inspired by interacting particle systems, where hyperedges act as fields inducing shared node dynamics. By incorporating attraction, repulsion, and Allen-Cahn forcing terms, particles of varying classes and features achieve class-dependent equilibrium, enabling separability through the particle-driven message passing. We investigate both first-order and second-order particle system equations for modeling these dynamics, which mitigate over-smoothing and heterophily thus can capture complete interactions. The more stable second-order system permits deeper message passing. Furthermore, we enhance deterministic message passing with stochastic element to account for interaction uncertainties. We prove theoretically that our approach mitigates over-smoothing by maintaining a positive lower bound on the hypergraph Dirichlet energy during propagation and thus to enable hypergraph message passing to go deep. Empirically, our models demonstrate competitive performance on diverse real-world hypergraph node classification tasks, excelling on both homophilic and heterophilic datasets.</description>

      <title>AcuRank: Uncertainty-Aware Adaptive Computation for Listwise Reranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Listwise reranking with large language models (LLMs) enhances top-ranked results in retrieval-based applications. Due to the limit in context size and high inference cost of long context, reranking is typically performed over a fixed size of small subsets, with the final ranking aggregated from these partial results. This fixed computation disregards query difficulty and document distribution, leading to inefficiencies. We propose AcuRank, an adaptive reranking framework that dynamically adjusts both the amount and target of computation based on uncertainty estimates over document relevance. Using a Bayesian TrueSkill model, we iteratively refine relevance estimates until reaching sufficient confidence levels, and our explicit modeling of ranking uncertainty enables principled control over reranking behavior and avoids unnecessary updates to confident predictions. Results on the TREC-DL and BEIR benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off and scales better with compute than fixed-computation baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of our method across diverse retrieval tasks and LLM-based reranking models.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Adaptation with Binary Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models perform poorly when domain shifts exist between training and test data. Test-time adaptation (TTA) is a paradigm to mitigate this issue by adapting pre-trained models using only unlabeled test samples. However, existing TTA methods can fail under severe domain shifts, while recent active TTA approaches requiring full-class labels are impractical due to high labeling costs. To address this issue, we introduce a new setting of TTA with binary feedback. This setting uses a few binary feedback inputs from annotators to indicate whether model predictions are correct, thereby significantly reducing the labeling burden of annotators. Under the setting, we propose BiTTA, a novel dual-path optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning to balance binary feedback-guided adaptation on uncertain samples with agreement-based self-adaptation on confident predictions. Experiments show BiTTA achieves 13.3%p accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling severe distribution shifts with minimal labeling effort.

      <title>CLaDMoP: Learning Transferrable Models from Successful Clinical Trials via LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many existing models for clinical trial outcome prediction are optimized using task-specific loss functions on trial phase-specific data. While this scheme may boost prediction for common diseases and drugs, it can hinder learning of generalizable representations, leading to more false positives/negatives. To address this limitation, we introduce CLaDMoP, a new pre-training approach for clinical trial outcome prediction, alongside the Successful Clinical Trials dataset(SCT), specifically designed for this task. CLaDMoP leverages a Large Language Model-to encode trials' eligibility criteria-linked to a lightweight Drug-Molecule branch through a novel multi-level fusion technique. To efficiently fuse long embeddings across levels, we incorporate a grouping block, drastically reducing computational overhead. CLaDMoP avoids reliance on task-specific objectives by pre-training on a "pair matching" proxy task. Compared to established zero-shot and few-shot baselines, our method significantly improves both PR-AUC and ROC-AUC, especially for phase I and phase II trials. We further evaluate and perform ablation on CLaDMoP after Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, comparing it to state-of-the-art supervised baselines, including MEXA-CTP, on the Trial Outcome Prediction(TOP) benchmark. CLaDMoP achieves up to 10.5% improvement in PR-AUC and 3.6% in ROC-AUC, while attaining comparable F1 score to MEXA-CTP, highlighting its potential for clinical trial outcome prediction. Code and SCT dataset can be downloaded from https://github.com/murai-lab/CLaDMoP.</description>

      <title>MRGAgents: A Multi-Agent Framework for Improved Medical Report Generation with Med-LVLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have been widely adopted for medical report generation. Despite Med-LVLMs producing state-of-the-art performance, they exhibit a bias toward predicting all findings as normal, leading to reports that overlook critical abnormalities. Furthermore, these models often fail to provide comprehensive descriptions of radiologically relevant regions necessary for accurate diagnosis. To address these challenges, we proposeMedical Report Generation Agents (MRGAgents), a novel multi-agent framework that fine-tunes specialized agents for different disease categories. By curating subsets of the IU X-ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets to train disease-specific agents, MRGAgents generates reports that more effectively balance normal and abnormal findings while ensuring a comprehensive description of clinically relevant regions. Our experiments demonstrate that MRGAgents outperformed the state-of-the-art, improving both report comprehensiveness and diagnostic utility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal speech enhancement aims to handle input speech with different distortions and input formats. To tackle this challenge, we present TS-URGENet, a Three-Stage Universal, Robust, and Generalizable speech Enhancement Network. To address various distortions, the proposed system employs a novel three-stage architecture consisting of a filling stage, a separation stage, and a restoration stage. The filling stage mitigates packet loss by preliminarily filling lost regions under noise interference, ensuring signal continuity. The separation stage suppresses noise, reverberation, and clipping distortion to improve speech clarity. Finally, the restoration stage compensates for bandwidth limitation, codec artifacts, and residual packet loss distortion, refining the overall speech quality. Our proposed TS-URGENet achieved outstanding performance in the Interspeech 2025 URGENT Challenge, ranking 2nd in Track 1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standing in 2025, at a critical juncture in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) and has led to the development of cutting-edge AI models such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Moreover, the efficient application of RFT to enhance the reasoning capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has attracted widespread attention from the community. In this position paper, we argue that reinforcement fine-tuning powers the reasoning capability of multimodal large language models. To begin with, we provide a detailed introduction to the fundamental background knowledge that researchers interested in this field should be familiar with. Furthermore, we meticulously summarize the improvements of RFT in powering reasoning capability of MLLMs into five key points: diverse modalities, diverse tasks and domains, better training algorithms, abundant benchmarks and thriving engineering frameworks. Finally, we propose five promising directions for future research that the community might consider. We hope that this position paper will provide valuable insights to the community at this pivotal stage in the advancement toward AGI. Summary of works done on RFT for MLLMs is available at https://github.com/Sun-Haoyuan23/Awesome-RL-based-Reasoning-MLLMs.</description>

Abstract: Intent detection, a core component of natural language understanding, has considerably evolved as a crucial mechanism in safeguarding large language models (LLMs). While prior work has applied intent detection to enhance LLMs' moderation guardrails, showing a significant success against content-level jailbreaks, the robustness of these intent-aware guardrails under malicious manipulations remains under-explored. In this work, we investigate the vulnerability of intent-aware guardrails and demonstrate that LLMs exhibit implicit intent detection capabilities. We propose a two-stage intent-based prompt-refinement framework, IntentPrompt, that first transforms harmful inquiries into structured outlines and further reframes them into declarative-style narratives by iteratively optimizing prompts via feedback loops to enhance jailbreak success for red-teaming purposes. Extensive experiments across four public benchmarks and various black-box LLMs indicate that our framework consistently outperforms several cutting-edge jailbreak methods and evades even advanced Intent Analysis (IA) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based defenses. Specifically, our "FSTR+SPIN" variant achieves attack success rates ranging from 88.25% to 96.54% against CoT-based defenses on the o1 model, and from 86.75% to 97.12% on the GPT-4o model under IA-based defenses. These findings highlight a critical weakness in LLMs' safety mechanisms and suggest that intent manipulation poses a growing challenge to content moderation guardrails.</description>

      <title>From Word to World: Evaluate and Mitigate Culture Bias via Word Association Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The human-centered word association test (WAT) serves as a cognitive proxy, revealing sociocultural variations through lexical-semantic patterns. We extend this test into an LLM-adaptive, free-relation task to assess the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with cross-cultural cognition. To mitigate the culture preference, we propose CultureSteer, an innovative approach that integrates a culture-aware steering mechanism to guide semantic representations toward culturally specific spaces. Experiments show that current LLMs exhibit significant bias toward Western cultural (notably in American) schemas at the word association level. In contrast, our model substantially improves cross-cultural alignment, surpassing prompt-based methods in capturing diverse semantic associations. Further validation on culture-sensitive downstream tasks confirms its efficacy in fostering cognitive alignment across cultures. This work contributes a novel methodological paradigm for enhancing cultural awareness in LLMs, advancing the development of more inclusive language technologies.</description>

      <title>PacTrain: Pruning and Adaptive Sparse Gradient Compression for Efficient Collective Communication in Distributed Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale deep neural networks (DNN) exhibit excellent performance for various tasks. As DNNs and datasets grow, distributed training becomes extremely time-consuming and demands larger clusters. A main bottleneck is the resulting gradient aggregation overhead. While gradient compression and sparse collective communication techniques are commonly employed to alleviate network load, many gradient compression schemes do not achieve acceleration of the training process while also preserving accuracy. This paper introduces PacTrain, a novel framework that accelerates distributed training by combining pruning with sparse gradient compression. Active pruning of the neural network makes the model weights and gradients sparse. By ensuring the global knowledge of the gradient sparsity among all distributed training workers, we can perform lightweight compression communication without harming accuracy. We show that the PacTrain compression scheme achieves a near-optimal compression strategy while remaining compatible with the all-reduce primitive. Experimental evaluations show that PacTrain improves training throughput by 1.25 to 8.72 times compared to state-of-the-art compression-enabled systems for representative vision and language models training tasks under bandwidth-constrained conditions.</description>

      <title>Learning without Isolation: Pathway Protection for Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep networks are prone to catastrophic forgetting during sequential task learning, i.e., losing the knowledge about old tasks upon learning new tasks. To this end, continual learning(CL) has emerged, whose existing methods focus mostly on regulating or protecting the parameters associated with the previous tasks. However, parameter protection is often impractical, since the size of parameters for storing the old-task knowledge increases linearly with the number of tasks, otherwise it is hard to preserve the parameters related to the old-task knowledge. In this work, we bring a dual opinion from neuroscience and physics to CL: in the whole networks, the pathways matter more than the parameters when concerning the knowledge acquired from the old tasks. Following this opinion, we propose a novel CL framework, learning without isolation(LwI), where model fusion is formulated as graph matching and the pathways occupied by the old tasks are protected without being isolated. Thanks to the sparsity of activation channels in a deep network, LwI can adaptively allocate available pathways for a new task, realizing pathway protection and addressing catastrophic forgetting in a parameter-efficient manner. Experiments on popular benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LwI.</description>

      <title>MASTER: Multi-Agent Security Through Exploration of Roles and Topological Structures -- A Comprehensive Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) exhibit remarkable problem-solving and task planning capabilities across diverse domains due to their specialized agentic roles and collaborative interactions. However, this also amplifies the severity of security risks under MAS attacks. To address this, we introduce MASTER, a novel security research framework for MAS, focusing on diverse Role configurations and Topological structures across various scenarios. MASTER offers an automated construction process for different MAS setups and an information-flow-based interaction paradigm. To tackle MAS security challenges in varied scenarios, we design a scenario-adaptive, extensible attack strategy utilizing role and topological information, which dynamically allocates targeted, domain-specific attack tasks for collaborative agent execution. Our experiments demonstrate that such an attack, leveraging role and topological information, exhibits significant destructive potential across most models. Additionally, we propose corresponding defense strategies, substantially enhancing MAS resilience across diverse scenarios. We anticipate that our framework and findings will provide valuable insights for future research into MAS security challenges.</description>

      <title>Autocomp: LLM-Driven Code Optimization for Tensor Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hardware accelerators, especially those designed for tensor processing, have become ubiquitous in today's computing landscape. However, even with significant efforts in building compilers, programming these tensor accelerators remains challenging, leaving much of their potential underutilized. Recently, large language models (LLMs), trained on large amounts of code, have shown significant promise in code generation and optimization tasks, but generating low-resource languages like specialized tensor accelerator code still poses a significant challenge. We tackle this challenge with Autocomp, an approach that empowers accelerator programmers to leverage domain knowledge and hardware feedback to optimize code via an automated LLM-driven search. We accomplish this by: 1) formulating each optimization pass as a structured two-phase prompt, divided into planning and code generation phases, 2) inserting domain knowledge during planning via a concise and adaptable optimization menu, and 3) integrating correctness and performance metrics from hardware as feedback at each search iteration. Across three categories of representative workloads and two different accelerators, we demonstrate that Autocomp-optimized code runs 5.6x (GEMM) and 2.7x (convolution) faster than the vendor-provided library, and outperforms expert-level hand-tuned code by 1.4x (GEMM), 1.1x (convolution), and 1.3x (fine-grained linear algebra). Additionally, we demonstrate that optimization schedules generated from Autocomp can be reused across similar tensor operations, improving speedups by up to 24% under a fixed sample budget.</description>

      <title>Removal of Hallucination on Hallucination: Debate-Augmented RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external knowledge, yet it introduces a critical issue: erroneous or biased retrieval can mislead generation, compounding hallucinations, a phenomenon we term Hallucination on Hallucination. To address this, we propose Debate-Augmented RAG (DRAG), a training-free framework that integrates Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) mechanisms into both retrieval and generation stages. In retrieval, DRAG employs structured debates among proponents, opponents, and judges to refine retrieval quality and ensure factual reliability. In generation, DRAG introduces asymmetric information roles and adversarial debates, enhancing reasoning robustness and mitigating factual inconsistencies. Evaluations across multiple tasks demonstrate that DRAG improves retrieval reliability, reduces RAG-induced hallucinations, and significantly enhances overall factual accuracy.

      <title>On Denoising Walking Videos for Gait Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To capture individual gait patterns, excluding identity-irrelevant cues in walking videos, such as clothing texture and color, remains a persistent challenge for vision-based gait recognition. Traditional silhouette- and pose-based methods, though theoretically effective at removing such distractions, often fall short of high accuracy due to their sparse and less informative inputs. Emerging end-to-end methods address this by directly denoising RGB videos using human priors. Building on this trend, we propose DenoisingGait, a novel gait denoising method. Inspired by the philosophy that "what I cannot create, I do not understand", we turn to generative diffusion models, uncovering how they partially filter out irrelevant factors for gait understanding. Additionally, we introduce a geometry-driven Feature Matching module, which, combined with background removal via human silhouettes, condenses the multi-channel diffusion features at each foreground pixel into a two-channel direction vector. Specifically, the proposed within- and cross-frame matching respectively capture the local vectorized structures of gait appearance and motion, producing a novel flow-like gait representation termed Gait Feature Field, which further reduces residual noise in diffusion features. Experiments on the CCPG, CASIA-B*, and SUSTech1K datasets demonstrate that DenoisingGait achieves a new SoTA performance in most cases for both within- and cross-domain evaluations.

      <title>HyperFake: Hyperspectral Reconstruction and Attention-Guided Analysis for Advanced Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deepfakes pose a significant threat to digital media security, with current detection methods struggling to generalize across different manipulation techniques and datasets. While recent approaches combine CNN-based architectures with Vision Transformers or leverage multi-modal learning, they remain limited by the inherent constraints of RGB data. We introduce HyperFake, a novel deepfake detection pipeline that reconstructs 31-channel hyperspectral data from standard RGB videos, revealing hidden manipulation traces invisible to conventional methods. Using an improved MST++ architecture, HyperFake enhances hyperspectral reconstruction, while a spectral attention mechanism selects the most critical spectral features for deepfake detection. The refined spectral data is then processed by an EfficientNet-based classifier optimized for spectral analysis, enabling more accurate and generalizable detection across different deepfake styles and datasets, all without the need for expensive hyperspectral cameras. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to leverage hyperspectral imaging reconstruction for deepfake detection, opening new possibilities for detecting increasingly sophisticated manipulations.</description>

      <title>Safety Alignment via Constrained Knowledge Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in safety alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms have not fully deleted harmful knowledge in LLMs, which allows such attacks to bypass safeguards and produce harmful outputs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel safety alignment strategy, Constrained Knowledge Unlearning (CKU), which focuses on two primary objectives: knowledge localization and retention, and unlearning harmful knowledge. CKU works by scoring neurons in specific multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers to identify a subset U of neurons associated with useful knowledge. During the unlearning process, CKU prunes the gradients of neurons in U to preserve valuable knowledge while effectively mitigating harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate that CKU significantly enhances model safety without compromising overall performance, offering a superior balance between safety and utility compared to existing methods. Additionally, our analysis of neuron knowledge sensitivity across various MLP layers provides valuable insights into the mechanics of safety alignment and model knowledge editing.</description>

      <title>MisoDICE: Multi-Agent Imitation from Unlabeled Mixed-Quality Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study offline imitation learning (IL) in cooperative multi-agent settings, where demonstrations have unlabeled mixed quality - containing both expert and suboptimal trajectories. Our proposed solution is structured in two stages: trajectory labeling and multi-agent imitation learning, designed jointly to enable effective learning from heterogeneous, unlabeled data. In the first stage, we combine advances in large language models and preference-based reinforcement learning to construct a progressive labeling pipeline that distinguishes expert-quality trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce MisoDICE, a novel multi-agent IL algorithm that leverages these labels to learn robust policies while addressing the computational complexity of large joint state-action spaces. By extending the popular single-agent DICE framework to multi-agent settings with a new value decomposition and mixing architecture, our method yields a convex policy optimization objective and ensures consistency between global and local policies. We evaluate MisoDICE on multiple standard multi-agent RL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance, especially when expert data is scarce.</description>

      <title>Debate-to-Detect: Reformulating Misinformation Detection as a Real-World Debate with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in digital platforms reveals the limitations of traditional detection methods, which mostly rely on static classification and fail to capture the intricate process of real-world fact-checking. Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that enhance automated reasoning, their application to misinformation detection remains hindered by issues of logical inconsistency and superficial verification. In response, we introduce Debate-to-Detect (D2D), a novel Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework that reformulates misinformation detection as a structured adversarial debate. Inspired by fact-checking workflows, D2D assigns domain-specific profiles to each agent and orchestrates a five-stage debate process, including Opening Statement, Rebuttal, Free Debate, Closing Statement, and Judgment. To transcend traditional binary classification, D2D introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanism that assesses each claim across five distinct dimensions: Factuality, Source Reliability, Reasoning Quality, Clarity, and Ethics. Experiments with GPT-4o on two fakenews datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, and the case study highlight D2D's capability to iteratively refine evidence while improving decision transparency, representing a substantial advancement towards robust and interpretable misinformation detection. The code will be open-sourced in a future release.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Zoom: Extreme Super-Resolution via Scale Autoregression and Preference Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern single-image super-resolution (SISR) models deliver photo-realistic results at the scale factors on which they are trained, but collapse when asked to magnify far beyond that regime. We address this scalability bottleneck with Chain-of-Zoom (CoZ), a model-agnostic framework that factorizes SISR into an autoregressive chain of intermediate scale-states with multi-scale-aware prompts. CoZ repeatedly re-uses a backbone SR model, decomposing the conditional probability into tractable sub-problems to achieve extreme resolutions without additional training. Because visual cues diminish at high magnifications, we augment each zoom step with multi-scale-aware text prompts generated by a vision-language model (VLM). The prompt extractor itself is fine-tuned using Generalized Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a critic VLM, aligning text guidance towards human preference. Experiments show that a standard 4x diffusion SR model wrapped in CoZ attains beyond 256x enlargement with high perceptual quality and fidelity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-generated reward signals are critical for aligning generative models with human preferences, guiding both training and inference-time evaluations. While large language models (LLMs) employed as proxy evaluators, i.e., LLM-as-a-Judge, significantly reduce the costs associated with manual annotations, they typically require extensive modality-specific training data and fail to generalize well across diverse multimodal tasks. In this paper, we propose Flex-Judge, a reasoning-guided multimodal judge model that leverages minimal textual reasoning data to robustly generalize across multiple modalities and evaluation formats. Our core intuition is that structured textual reasoning explanations inherently encode generalizable decision-making patterns, enabling an effective transfer to multimodal judgments, e.g., with images or videos. Empirical results demonstrate that Flex-Judge, despite being trained on significantly fewer text data, achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art commercial APIs and extensively trained multimodal evaluators. Notably, Flex-Judge presents broad impact in modalities like molecule, where comprehensive evaluation benchmarks are scarce, underscoring its practical value in resource-constrained domains. Our framework highlights reasoning-based text supervision as a powerful, cost-effective alternative to traditional annotation-intensive approaches, substantially advancing scalable multimodal model-as-a-judge.</description>

      <title>LLM-Meta-SR: Learning to Evolve Selection Operators for Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized algorithm development, yet their application in symbolic regression, where algorithms automatically discover symbolic expressions from data, remains constrained and is typically designed manually by human experts. In this paper, we propose a learning-to-evolve framework that enables LLMs to automatically design selection operators for evolutionary symbolic regression algorithms. We first identify two key limitations in existing LLM-based algorithm evolution techniques: code bloat and a lack of semantic guidance. Bloat results in unnecessarily complex components, and the absence of semantic awareness can lead to ineffective exchange of useful code components, both of which can reduce the interpretability of the designed algorithm or hinder evolutionary learning progress. To address these issues, we enhance the LLM-based evolution framework for meta symbolic regression with two key innovations: bloat control and a complementary, semantics-aware selection operator. Additionally, we embed domain knowledge into the prompt, enabling the LLM to generate more effective and contextually relevant selection operators. Our experimental results on symbolic regression benchmarks show that LLMs can devise selection operators that outperform nine expert-designed baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance. This demonstrates that LLMs can exceed expert-level algorithm design for symbolic regression.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Causal Mask Attention for Vision-Language Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal attention has become a foundational mechanism in autoregressive vision-language models (VLMs), unifying textual and visual inputs under a single generative framework. However, existing causal mask-based strategies are inherited from large language models (LLMs) where they are tailored for text-only decoding, and their adaptation to vision tokens is insufficiently addressed in the prefill stage. Strictly masking future positions for vision queries introduces overly rigid constraints, which hinder the model's ability to leverage future context that often contains essential semantic cues for accurate inference. In this work, we empirically investigate how different causal masking strategies affect vision-language inference and then propose a family of future-aware attentions tailored for this setting. We first empirically analyze the effect of previewing future tokens for vision queries and demonstrate that rigid masking undermines the model's capacity to capture useful contextual semantic representations. Based on these findings, we propose a lightweight attention family that aggregates future visual context into past representations via pooling, effectively preserving the autoregressive structure while enhancing cross-token dependencies. We evaluate a range of causal masks across diverse vision-language inference settings and show that selectively compressing future semantic context into past representations benefits the inference.</description>

      <title>Trust, or Don't Predict: Introducing the CWSA Family for Confidence-Aware Model Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent machine learning systems, confidence scores are being utilized more and more to manage selective prediction, whereby a model can abstain from making a prediction when it is unconfident. Yet, conventional metrics like accuracy, expected calibration error (ECE), and area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) do not capture the actual reliability of predictions. These metrics either disregard confidence entirely, dilute valuable localized information through averaging, or neglect to suitably penalize overconfident misclassifications, which can be particularly detrimental in real-world systems. We introduce two new metrics Confidence-Weighted Selective Accuracy (CWSA) and its normalized variant CWSA+ that offer a principled and interpretable way to evaluate predictive models under confidence thresholds. Unlike existing methods, our metrics explicitly reward confident accuracy and penalize overconfident mistakes. They are threshold-local, decomposable, and usable in both evaluation and deployment settings where trust and risk must be quantified. Through exhaustive experiments on both real-world data sets (MNIST, CIFAR-10) and artificial model variants (calibrated, overconfident, underconfident, random, perfect), we show that CWSA and CWSA+ both effectively detect nuanced failure modes and outperform classical metrics in trust-sensitive tests. Our results confirm that CWSA is a sound basis for developing and assessing selective prediction systems for safety-critical domains.</description>

      <title>DDO: Dual-Decision Optimization via Multi-Agent Collaboration for LLM-Based Medical Consultation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong generalization and reasoning abilities, making them well-suited for complex decision-making tasks such as medical consultation (MC). However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to capture the dual nature of MC, which entails two distinct sub-tasks: symptom inquiry, a sequential decision-making process, and disease diagnosis, a classification problem. This mismatch often results in ineffective symptom inquiry and unreliable disease diagnosis. To address this, we propose \textbf{DDO}, a novel LLM-based framework that performs \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{D}ecision \textbf{O}ptimization by decoupling and independently optimizing the the two sub-tasks through a collaborative multi-agent workflow. Experiments on three real-world MC datasets show that DDO consistently outperforms existing LLM-based approaches and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art generation-based methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in the MC task.</description>

      <title>ThanoRA: Task Heterogeneity-Aware Multi-Task Low-Rank Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely adopted for downstream fine-tuning of foundation models due to its efficiency and zero additional inference cost. Many real-world applications require foundation models to specialize in multiple tasks simultaneously, motivating the need for efficient multi-task adaptation. While recent approaches integrate LoRA with mixture-of-experts (MoE) to address this, the use of routers prevents parameter mergeability, which increases inference overhead and hinders unified multi-task adaptation, thereby limiting deployment practicality. In this work, we propose ThanoRA, a Task Heterogeneity-Aware Multi-Task Low-Rank Adaptation framework that enables multi-task adaptation while preserving the inference efficiency of LoRA. ThanoRA jointly models task heterogeneity and mitigates subspace interference throughout training. Specifically, motivated by inherent differences in complexity and heterogeneity across tasks, ThanoRA constructs task-specific LoRA subspaces at initialization, enabling fine-grained knowledge injection aligned with task heterogeneity. Furthermore, to prevent task interference and subspace collapse during multi-task training, ThanoRA introduces a subspace-preserving regularization that maintains the independence of task-specific representations. With the synergy of both components, ThanoRA enables efficient and unified multi-task adaptation. Extensive experiments across multimodal and text-only benchmarks under varying multi-task mixtures demonstrate that ThanoRA consistently achieves robust and superior performance over strong baselines without introducing additional inference overhead.

      <title>Anomaly detection in radio galaxy data with trainable COSFIRE filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting anomalies in radio astronomy is challenging due to the vast amounts of data and the rarity of labeled anomalous examples. Addressing this challenge requires efficient methods capable of identifying unusual radio galaxy morphologies without relying on extensive supervision. This work introduces an innovative approach to anomaly detection based on morphological characteristics of the radio sources using trainable COSFIRE (Combination of Shifted Filter Responses) filters as an efficient alternative to complex deep learning methods. The framework integrates COSFIRE descriptors with an unsupervised Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm to identify unusual radio galaxy morphologies. Evaluations on a radio galaxy benchmark data set demonstrate strong performance, with the COSFIRE-based approach achieving a geometric mean (G-Mean) score of 79%, surpassing the 77% achieved by a computationally intensive deep learning autoencoder. By characterizing normal patterns and detecting deviations, this semi-supervised methodology overcomes the need for anomalous examples in the training set, a major limitation of traditional supervised methods. This approach shows promise for next-generation radio telescopes, where fast processing and the ability to discover unknown phenomena are crucial.</description>

      <title>SEW: Self-Evolving Agentic Workflows for Automated Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness in code generation tasks. To enable LLMs to address more complex coding challenges, existing research has focused on crafting multi-agent systems with agentic workflows, where complex coding tasks are decomposed into sub-tasks, assigned to specialized agents. Despite their effectiveness, current approaches heavily rely on hand-crafted agentic workflows, with both agent topologies and prompts manually designed, which limits their ability to automatically adapt to different types of coding problems. To address these limitations and enable automated workflow design, we propose \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{W}orkflow (\textbf{SEW}), a novel self-evolving framework that automatically generates and optimises multi-agent workflows. Extensive experiments on three coding benchmark datasets, including the challenging LiveCodeBench, demonstrate that our SEW can automatically design agentic workflows and optimise them through self-evolution, bringing up to 33\% improvement on LiveCodeBench compared to using the backbone LLM only. Furthermore, by investigating different representation schemes of workflow, we provide insights into the optimal way to encode workflow information with text.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Geometric Trajectory Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of N-body systems is a fundamental problem with applications in a wide range of fields, such as molecular dynamics, biochemistry, and pedestrian dynamics. Machine learning has become an invaluable tool for scaling physics-based simulators and developing models directly from experimental data. In particular, recent advances based on deep generative modeling and geometric deep learning have enabled probabilistic simulation by modeling complex distributions over trajectories while respecting the permutation symmetry that is fundamental to N-body systems. However, to generate realistic trajectories, existing methods must learn complex transformations starting from uninformed noise and do not allow for the exploitation of domain-informed priors. In this work, we propose STFlow to address this limitation. By leveraging flow matching and data-dependent couplings, STFlow facilitates physics-informed simulation of geometric trajectories without sacrificing model expressivity or scalability. Our evaluation on N-body dynamical systems, molecular dynamics, and pedestrian dynamics benchmarks shows that STFlow produces significantly lower prediction errors while enabling more efficient inference, highlighting the benefits of employing physics-informed prior distributions in probabilistic geometric trajectory modeling.</description>

      <title>Robustness in Large Language Models: A Survey of Mitigation Strategies and Evaluation Metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising cornerstone for the development of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). However, ensuring the robustness of LLMs remains a critical challenge. To address these challenges and advance the field, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of current studies in this area. First, we systematically examine the nature of robustness in LLMs, including its conceptual foundations, the importance of consistent performance across diverse inputs, and the implications of failure modes in real-world applications. Next, we analyze the sources of non-robustness, categorizing intrinsic model limitations, data-driven vulnerabilities, and external adversarial factors that compromise reliability. Following this, we review state-of-the-art mitigation strategies, and then we discuss widely adopted benchmarks, emerging metrics, and persistent gaps in assessing real-world reliability. Finally, we synthesize findings from existing surveys and interdisciplinary studies to highlight trends, unresolved issues, and pathways for future research.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Prediction-Powered AutoEval with Reliability and Efficiency Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selecting artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as large language models (LLMs), from multiple candidates requires accurate performance estimation. This is ideally achieved through empirical evaluations involving abundant real-world data. However, such evaluations are costly and impractical at scale. To address this challenge, autoevaluation methods leverage synthetic data produced by automated evaluators, such as LLMs-as-judges, reducing variance but potentially introducing bias. Recent approaches have employed semi-supervised prediction-powered inference (\texttt{PPI}) to correct for the bias of autoevaluators. However, the use of autoevaluators may lead in practice to a degradation in sample efficiency compared to conventional methods using only real-world data. In this paper, we propose \texttt{R-AutoEval+}, a novel framework that provides finite-sample reliability guarantees on the model evaluation, while also ensuring an enhanced (or at least no worse) sample efficiency compared to conventional methods. The key innovation of \texttt{R-AutoEval+} is an adaptive construction of the model evaluation variable, which dynamically tunes its reliance on synthetic data, reverting to conventional methods when the autoevaluator is insufficiently accurate. Experiments on the use of LLMs-as-judges for the optimization of quantization settings for the weights of an LLM, and for prompt design in LLMs confirm the reliability and efficiency of \texttt{R-AutoEval+}.</description>

      <title>Restoring Real-World Images with an Internal Detail Enhancement Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Restoring real-world degraded images, such as old photographs or low-resolution images, presents a significant challenge due to the complex, mixed degradations they exhibit, such as scratches, color fading, and noise. Recent data-driven approaches have struggled with two main challenges: achieving high-fidelity restoration and providing object-level control over colorization. While diffusion models have shown promise in generating high-quality images with specific controls, they often fail to fully preserve image details during restoration. In this work, we propose an internal detail-preserving diffusion model for high-fidelity restoration of real-world degraded images. Our method utilizes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model as a generative prior, eliminating the need to train a model from scratch. Central to our approach is the Internal Image Detail Enhancement (IIDE) technique, which directs the diffusion model to preserve essential structural and textural information while mitigating degradation effects. The process starts by mapping the input image into a latent space, where we inject the diffusion denoising process with degradation operations that simulate the effects of various degradation factors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in both qualitative assessments and perceptual quantitative evaluations. Additionally, our approach supports text-guided restoration, enabling object-level colorization control that mimics the expertise of professional photo editing.</description>

      <title>Can MLLMs Guide Me Home? A Benchmark Study on Fine-Grained Visual Reasoning from Transit Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in visual tasks, including semantic scene understanding and text-image alignment, with reasoning variants enhancing performance on complex tasks involving mathematics and logic. However, their capacity for reasoning tasks involving fine-grained visual understanding remains insufficiently evaluated. To address this gap, we introduce ReasonMap, a benchmark designed to assess the fine-grained visual understanding and spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs. ReasonMap encompasses high-resolution transit maps from 30 cities across 13 countries and includes 1,008 question-answer pairs spanning two question types and three templates. Furthermore, we design a two-level evaluation pipeline that properly assesses answer correctness and quality. Comprehensive evaluations of 15 popular MLLMs, including both base and reasoning variants, reveal a counterintuitive pattern: among open-source models, base models outperform reasoning ones, while the opposite trend is observed in closed-source models. Additionally, performance generally degrades when visual inputs are masked, indicating that while MLLMs can leverage prior knowledge to answer some questions, fine-grained visual reasoning tasks still require genuine visual perception for strong performance. Our benchmark study offers new insights into visual reasoning and contributes to investigating the gap between open-source and closed-source models.</description>

      <title>An AI Capability Threshold for Rent-Funded Universal Basic Income in an AI-Automated Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the first closed-form condition under which artificial intelligence (AI) capital profits could sustainably finance a universal basic income (UBI) without additional taxes or new job creation. In a Solow-Zeira economy characterized by a continuum of automatable tasks, a constant net saving rate $s$, and task-elasticity $\sigma &lt; 1$, we analyze how the AI capability threshold--defined as the productivity level of AI relative to pre-AI automation--varies under different economic scenarios. At present economic parameters, we find that AI systems must achieve only approximately 5-6 times existing automation productivity to finance an 11\%-of-GDP UBI, in the worst case situation where \emph{no} new jobs or tasks are created.
  Our analysis also reveals some specific policy levers: raising public revenue share (e.g. profit taxation) of AI capital from the current 15\% to about 33\% halves the required AI capability threshold to attain UBI to 3 times existing automotion productivity, but gains diminish beyond 50\% public revenue share, especially if regulatory costs increase. Market structure also strongly affects outcomes: monopolistic or concentrated oligopolistic markets reduce the threshold by increasing economic rents, whereas heightened competition significantly raises it.
  Overall, these results suggest a couple policy recommendations: maximizing public revenue share up to a point so that operating costs are minimized, and strategically managing market competition can ensure AI's growing capabilities translate into meaningful social benefits within realistic technological progress scenarios.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models in the Task of Automatic Validation of Text Classifier Predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models for text classification are trained to predict a class for a given text. To do this, training and validation samples must be prepared: a set of texts is collected, and each text is assigned a class. These classes are usually assigned by human annotators with different expertise levels, depending on the specific classification task. Collecting such samples from scratch is labor-intensive because it requires finding specialists and compensating them for their work; moreover, the number of available specialists is limited, and their productivity is constrained by human factors. While it may not be too resource-intensive to collect samples once, the ongoing need to retrain models (especially in incremental learning pipelines) to address data drift (also called model drift) makes the data collection process crucial and costly over the model's entire lifecycle. This paper proposes several approaches to replace human annotators with Large Language Models (LLMs) to test classifier predictions for correctness, helping ensure model quality and support high-quality incremental learning.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Alleviate Catastrophic Forgetting in Graph Continual Learning? A Systematic Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, real-world data, including graph-structure data, often arrives in a streaming manner, which means that learning systems need to continuously acquire new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information. Although substantial existing works attempt to address catastrophic forgetting in graph machine learning, they are all based on training from scratch with streaming data. With the rise of pretrained models, an increasing number of studies have leveraged their strong generalization ability for continual learning. Therefore, in this work, we attempt to answer whether large language models (LLMs) can mitigate catastrophic forgetting in Graph Continual Learning (GCL). We first point out that current experimental setups for GCL have significant flaws, as the evaluation stage may lead to task ID leakage. Then, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in more realistic scenarios and find that even minor modifications can lead to outstanding results. Finally, based on extensive experiments, we propose a simple-yet-effective method, Simple Graph Continual Learning (SimGCL), that surpasses the previous state-of-the-art GNN-based baseline by around 20% under the rehearsal-free constraint. To facilitate reproducibility, we have developed an easy-to-use benchmark LLM4GCL for training and evaluating existing GCL methods.

      <title>GRE Suite: Geo-localization Inference via Fine-Tuned Vision-Language Models and Enhanced Reasoning Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in visual reasoning tasks. However, geo-localization presents unique challenges, requiring the extraction of multigranular visual cues from images and their integration with external world knowledge for systematic reasoning. Current approaches to geo-localization tasks often lack robust reasoning mechanisms and explainability, limiting their effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Geo Reason Enhancement (GRE) Suite, a novel framework that augments VLMs with structured reasoning chains for accurate and interpretable location inference. The GRE Suite is systematically developed across three key dimensions: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce GRE30K, a high-quality geo-localization reasoning dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained visual and contextual analysis. Next, we present the GRE model, which employs a multi-stage reasoning strategy to progressively infer scene attributes, local details, and semantic features, thereby narrowing down potential geographic regions with enhanced precision. Finally, we construct the Geo Reason Evaluation Benchmark (GREval-Bench), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses VLMs across diverse urban, natural, and landmark scenes to measure both coarse-grained (e.g., country, continent) and fine-grained (e.g., city, street) localization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that GRE significantly outperforms existing methods across all granularities of geo-localization tasks, underscoring the efficacy of reasoning-augmented VLMs in complex geographic inference. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/Thorin215/GRE.</description>

      <title>Steering LLM Reasoning Through Bias-Only Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work on reasoning-oriented language models, exemplified by o1-like systems, suggests that reinforcement-learning (RL) finetuning does not create new capabilities but instead strengthens reasoning patterns already latent in the pretrained network. We test this claim by training steering vectors: layer-wise biases that additively amplify selected hidden features while leaving all original weights unchanged. Experiments on four base models across the GSM8K and MATH benchmarks show that steering vectors recover, and in several cases exceed, the accuracy of fully-tuned counterparts. This result supports the view that the required reasoning skills pre-exist in the base model. Further, logit-lens analysis reveals that the trained vectors consistently boost token groups linked to structured languages and logical connectors, providing an interpretable account that aligns with the demands of quantitative reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>A General Knowledge Injection Framework for ICD Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ICD Coding aims to assign a wide range of medical codes to a medical text document, which is a popular and challenging task in the healthcare domain. To alleviate the problems of long-tail distribution and the lack of annotations of code-specific evidence, many previous works have proposed incorporating code knowledge to improve coding performance. However, existing methods often focus on a single type of knowledge and design specialized modules that are complex and incompatible with each other, thereby limiting their scalability and effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose GKI-ICD, a novel, general knowledge injection framework that integrates three key types of knowledge, namely ICD Description, ICD Synonym, and ICD Hierarchy, without specialized design of additional modules. The comprehensive utilization of the above knowledge, which exhibits both differences and complementarity, can effectively enhance the ICD coding performance. Extensive experiments on existing popular ICD coding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of GKI-ICD, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance on most evaluation metrics. Code is available at https://github.com/xuzhang0112/GKI-ICD.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bangla or Bengali is the national language of Bangladesh, people from different regions don't talk in proper Bangla. Every division of Bangladesh has its own local language like Sylheti, Chittagong etc. In recent years some papers were published on Bangla language like sentiment analysis, fake news detection and classifications, but a few of them were on Bangla languages. This research is for the local language and this particular paper is on Sylheti language. It presented a comprehensive system using Natural Language Processing or NLP techniques for translating Pure or Modern Bangla to locally spoken Sylheti Bangla language. Total 1200 data used for training 3 models LSTM, Bi-LSTM and Seq2Seq and LSTM scored the best in performance with 89.3% accuracy. The findings of this research may contribute to the growth of Bangla NLP researchers for future more advanced innovations.</description>

      <title>GainRAG: Preference Alignment in Retrieval-Augmented Generation through Gain Signal Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework introduces a retrieval module to dynamically inject retrieved information into the input context of large language models (LLMs), and has demonstrated significant success in various NLP tasks. However, the current study points out that there is a preference gap between retrievers and LLMs in the RAG framework, which limit the further improvement of system performance. Some highly relevant passages may interfere with LLM reasoning because they contain complex or contradictory information; while some indirectly related or even inaccurate content may help LLM generate more accurate answers by providing suggestive information or logical clues. To solve this, we propose GainRAG, a novel approach that aligns the retriever's and LLM's preferences by defining a new metric, "gain", which measure how well an input passage contributes to correct outputs. Specifically, we propose a method to estimate these gain signals and train a middleware that aligns the preferences of the retriever and the LLM using only limited data. In addition, we introduce a pseudo-passage strategy to mitigate degradation. The experimental results on 6 datasets verify the effectiveness of GainRAG.</description>

      <title>Neural Parameter Search for Slimmer Fine-Tuned Models and Better Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models and their checkpoints have significantly advanced deep learning, boosting performance across various applications. However, fine-tuned models often struggle outside their specific domains and exhibit considerable redundancy. Recent studies suggest that combining a pruned fine-tuned model with the original pre-trained model can mitigate forgetting, reduce interference when merging model parameters across tasks, and improve compression efficiency. In this context, developing an effective pruning strategy for fine-tuned models is crucial. Leveraging the advantages of the task vector mechanism, we preprocess fine-tuned models by calculating the differences between them and the original model. Recognizing that different task vector subspaces contribute variably to model performance, we introduce a novel method called Neural Parameter Search (NPS-Pruning) for slimming down fine-tuned models. This method enhances pruning efficiency by searching through neural parameters of task vectors within low-rank subspaces. Our method has three key applications: enhancing knowledge transfer through pairwise model interpolation, facilitating effective knowledge fusion via model merging, and enabling the deployment of compressed models that retain near-original performance while significantly reducing storage costs. Extensive experiments across vision, NLP, and multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, resulting in substantial performance gains. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/duguodong7/NPS-Pruning.</description>

      <title>VLA-RL: Towards Masterful and General Robotic Manipulation with Scalable Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent high-capacity vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive performance on a range of robotic manipulation tasks by imitating human demonstrations. However, exploiting offline data with limited visited states will cause execution failure in out-of-distribution scenarios. Intuitively, an exploration-based method that improves on online collected data at test time could address this limitation. We present VLA-RL, an algorithmic and systematic framework that leverages online reinforcement learning (RL) to improve pretrained auto-regressive VLAs in downstream tasks. Within a unified perspective, we first introduce a trajectory-level RL formulation for auto-regressive VLA training, which models general robotic manipulation trajectory as multi-modal multi-turn conversation. To address the challenge of sparse rewards, we fine-tune a pretrained vision-language model as a robotic process reward model, which is trained on pseudo reward labels annotated on automatically extracted task segments. To scale up, we identify several implementation findings that improve the stability and efficiency including curriculum selection strategy, GPU-balanced vectorized environments, batch decoding, and critic warmup. VLA-RL enables OpenVLA-7B to surpass the strongest finetuned baseline by 4.5% on 40 challenging robotic manipulation tasks in LIBERO, and even matches the performance of advanced commercial models such as $\pi_0$-FAST. Notably, we observe that VLA-RL benefits from increased test-time optimization, indicating an early spark of inference scaling laws in robotics.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport-Based Token Weighting scheme for Enhanced Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising framework for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences by directly optimizing the log-likelihood difference between chosen and rejected responses. However, existing methods assign equal importance to all tokens in the response, while humans focus on more meaningful parts. This leads to suboptimal preference optimization, as irrelevant or noisy tokens disproportionately influence DPO loss. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{T}ransport-based token weighting scheme for enhancing direct \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization (OTPO). By emphasizing semantically meaningful token pairs and de-emphasizing less relevant ones, our method introduces a context-aware token weighting scheme that yields a more contrastive reward difference estimate. This adaptive weighting enhances reward stability, improves interpretability, and ensures that preference optimization focuses on meaningful differences between responses. Extensive experiments have validated OTPO's effectiveness in improving instruction-following ability across various settings\footnote{Code is available at https://github.com/Mimasss2/OTPO.}.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Usefulness of Non-Diagnostic Speech Data for Developing Parkinson's Disease Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech-based Parkinson's disease (PD) detection has gained attention for its automated, cost-effective, and non-intrusive nature. As research studies usually rely on data from diagnostic-oriented speech tasks, this work explores the feasibility of diagnosing PD on the basis of speech data not originally intended for diagnostic purposes, using the Turn-Taking (TT) dataset. Our findings indicate that TT can be as useful as diagnostic-oriented PD datasets like PC-GITA. We also investigate which specific dataset characteristics impact PD classification performance. The results show that concatenating audio recordings and balancing participants' gender and status distributions can be beneficial. Cross-dataset evaluation reveals that models trained on PC-GITA generalize poorly to TT, whereas models trained on TT perform better on PC-GITA. Furthermore, we provide insights into the high variability across folds, which is mainly due to large differences in individual speaker performance.</description>

      <title>LoTA-QAF: Lossless Ternary Adaptation for Quantization-Aware Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization and fine-tuning are crucial for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices. However, fine-tuning quantized models presents significant challenges, primarily stemming from: First, the mismatch in data types between the low-precision quantized weights (e.g., 4-bit) and the high-precision adaptation weights (e.g., 16-bit). This mismatch limits the computational efficiency advantage offered by quantized weights during inference. Second, potential accuracy degradation when merging these high-precision adaptation weights into the low-precision quantized weights, as the adaptation weights often necessitate approximation or truncation. Third, as far as we know, no existing methods support the lossless merging of adaptation while adjusting all quantized weights. To address these challenges, we introduce lossless ternary adaptation for quantization-aware fine-tuning (LoTA-QAF). This is a novel fine-tuning method specifically designed for quantized LLMs, enabling the lossless merging of ternary adaptation weights into quantized weights and the adjustment of all quantized weights. LoTA-QAF operates through a combination of: i) A custom-designed ternary adaptation (TA) that aligns ternary weights with the quantization grid and uses these ternary weights to adjust quantized weights. ii) A TA-based mechanism that enables the lossless merging of adaptation weights. iii) Ternary signed gradient descent (t-SignSGD) for updating the TA weights. We apply LoTA-QAF to Llama-3.1/3.3 and Qwen-2.5 model families and validate its effectiveness on several downstream tasks. On the MMLU benchmark, our method effectively recovers performance for quantized models, surpassing 16-bit LoRA by up to 5.14\%. For task-specific fine-tuning, 16-bit LoRA achieves superior results, but LoTA-QAF still outperforms other methods.</description>

      <title>Message-Passing State-Space Models: Improving Graph Learning with Modern Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent success of State-Space Models (SSMs) in sequence modeling has motivated their adaptation to graph learning, giving rise to Graph State-Space Models (GSSMs). However, existing GSSMs operate by applying SSM modules to sequences extracted from graphs, often compromising core properties such as permutation equivariance, message-passing compatibility, and computational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective by embedding the key principles of modern SSM computation directly into the Message-Passing Neural Network framework, resulting in a unified methodology for both static and temporal graphs. Our approach, MP-SSM, enables efficient, permutation-equivariant, and long-range information propagation while preserving the architectural simplicity of message passing. Crucially, MP-SSM enables an exact sensitivity analysis, which we use to theoretically characterize information flow and evaluate issues like vanishing gradients and over-squashing in the deep regime. Furthermore, our design choices allow for a highly optimized parallel implementation akin to modern SSMs. We validate MP-SSM across a wide range of tasks, including node classification, graph property prediction, long-range benchmarks, and spatiotemporal forecasting, demonstrating both its versatility and strong empirical performance.</description>

      <title>MoMBS: Mixed-order minibatch sampling enhances model training from diverse-quality images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural images exhibit label diversity (clean vs. noisy) in noisy-labeled image classification and prevalence diversity (abundant vs. sparse) in long-tailed image classification. Similarly, medical images in universal lesion detection (ULD) exhibit substantial variations in image quality, encompassing attributes such as clarity and label correctness. How to effectively leverage training images with diverse qualities becomes a problem in learning deep models. Conventional training mechanisms, such as self-paced curriculum learning (SCL) and online hard example mining (OHEM), relieve this problem by reweighting images with high loss values. Despite their success, these methods still confront two challenges: (i) the loss-based measure of sample hardness is imprecise, preventing optimum handling of different cases, and (ii) there exists under-utilization in SCL or over-utilization OHEM with the identified hard samples. To address these issues, this paper revisits the minibatch sampling (MBS), a technique widely used in deep network training but largely unexplored concerning the handling of diverse-quality training samples. We discover that the samples within a minibatch influence each other during training; thus, we propose a novel Mixed-order Minibatch Sampling (MoMBS) method to optimize the use of training samples with diverse qualities. MoMBS introduces a measure that takes both loss and uncertainty into account to surpass a sole reliance on loss and allows for a more refined categorization of high-loss samples by distinguishing them as either poorly labeled and under represented or well represented and overfitted. We prioritize under represented samples as the main gradient contributors in a minibatch and keep them from the negative influences of poorly labeled or overfitted samples with a mixed-order minibatch sampling design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of energy Internet and energy system integration, the increasing adoption of distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems presents new challenges on smart monitoring and measurement for utility companies, particularly in separating PV generation from net electricity load. Existing methods struggle with feature extraction from net load and capturing the relevance between weather factors. This paper proposes a PV disaggregation method that integrates Hierarchical Interpolation (HI) and multi-head self-attention mechanisms. By using HI to extract net load features and multi-head self-attention to capture the complex dependencies between weather factors, the method achieves precise PV generation predictions. Simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world data, supporting improved monitoring and management of distributed energy systems.</description>

      <title>Agent-Based Decentralized Energy Management of EV Charging Station with Solar Photovoltaics via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of energy net zero within smart cities, transportation electrification plays a pivotal role. The adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) keeps increasing, making energy management of EV charging stations critically important. While previous studies have managed to reduce energy cost of EV charging while maintaining grid stability, they often overlook the robustness of EV charging management against uncertainties of various forms, such as varying charging behaviors and possible faults in faults in some chargers. To address the gap, a novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach is proposed treating each charger to be an agent and coordinate all the agents in the EV charging station with solar photovoltaics in a more realistic scenario, where system faults may occur. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is incorporated in the MARL algorithm to extract temporal features from time-series. Additionally, a dense reward mechanism is designed for training the agents in the MARL algorithm to improve EV charging experience. Through validation on a real-world dataset, we show that our approach is robust against system uncertainties and faults and also effective in minimizing EV charging costs and maximizing charging service satisfaction.</description>

      <title>Smart Energy Guardian: A Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Detecting Fraudulent PV Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the proliferation of smart grids, smart cities face growing challenges due to cyber-attacks and sophisticated electricity theft behaviors, particularly in residential photovoltaic (PV) generation systems. Traditional Electricity Theft Detection (ETD) methods often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrating multi-source data, limiting their effectiveness. In this work, we propose an efficient ETD method that accurately identifies fraudulent behaviors in residential PV generation, thus ensuring the supply-demand balance in smart cities. Our hybrid deep learning model, combining multi-scale Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer, excels in capturing both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies. Additionally, we introduce a data embedding technique that seamlessly integrates time-series data with discrete temperature variables, enhancing detection robustness. Extensive simulation experiments using real-world data validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating significant improvements in the accuracy of detecting sophisticated energy theft activities, thereby contributing to the stability and fairness of energy systems in smart cities.</description>

      <title>How Is LLM Reasoning Distracted by Irrelevant Context? An Analysis Using a Controlled Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Grade School Math with Distracting Context (GSM-DC), a synthetic benchmark to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning robustness against systematically controlled irrelevant context (IC). GSM-DC constructs symbolic reasoning graphs with precise distractor injections, enabling rigorous, reproducible evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs are significantly sensitive to IC, affecting both reasoning path selection and arithmetic accuracy. Additionally, training models with strong distractors improves performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We further propose a stepwise tree search guided by a process reward model, which notably enhances robustness in out-of-distribution conditions.</description>

      <title>Towards an automatic method for generating topical vocabulary test forms for specific reading passages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background knowledge is typically needed for successful comprehension of topical and domain specific reading passages, such as in the STEM domain. However, there are few automated measures of student knowledge that can be readily deployed and scored in time to make predictions on whether a given student will likely be able to understand a specific content area text. In this paper, we present our effort in developing K-tool, an automated system for generating topical vocabulary tests that measure students' background knowledge related to a specific text. The system automatically detects the topic of a given text and produces topical vocabulary items based on their relationship with the topic. This information is used to automatically generate background knowledge forms that contain words that are highly related to the topic and words that share similar features but do not share high associations to the topic. Prior research indicates that performance on such tasks can help determine whether a student is likely to understand a particular text based on their knowledge state. The described system is intended for use with middle and high school student population of native speakers of English. It is designed to handle single reading passages and is not dependent on any corpus or text collection. In this paper, we describe the system architecture and present an initial evaluation of the system outputs.</description>

      <title>StyleGuard: Preventing Text-to-Image-Model-based Style Mimicry Attacks by Style Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have been widely used for style mimicry and personalized customization through methods such as DreamBooth and Textual Inversion. This has raised concerns about intellectual property protection and the generation of deceptive content. Recent studies, such as Glaze and Anti-DreamBooth, have proposed using adversarial noise to protect images from these attacks. However, recent purification-based methods, such as DiffPure and Noise Upscaling, have successfully attacked these latest defenses, showing the vulnerabilities of these methods. Moreover, present methods show limited transferability across models, making them less effective against unknown text-to-image models. To address these issues, we propose a novel anti-mimicry method, StyleGuard. We propose a novel style loss that optimizes the style-related features in the latent space to make it deviate from the original image, which improves model-agnostic transferability. Additionally, to enhance the perturbation's ability to bypass diffusion-based purification, we designed a novel upscale loss that involves ensemble purifiers and upscalers during training. Extensive experiments on the WikiArt and CelebA datasets demonstrate that StyleGuard outperforms existing methods in robustness against various transformations and purifications, effectively countering style mimicry in various models. Moreover, StyleGuard is effective on different style mimicry methods, including DreamBooth and Textual Inversion.</description>

      <title>Strong Membership Inference Attacks on Massive Datasets and (Moderately) Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art membership inference attacks (MIAs) typically require training many reference models, making it difficult to scale these attacks to large pre-trained language models (LLMs). As a result, prior research has either relied on weaker attacks that avoid training reference models (e.g., fine-tuning attacks), or on stronger attacks applied to small-scale models and datasets. However, weaker attacks have been shown to be brittle - achieving close-to-arbitrary success - and insights from strong attacks in simplified settings do not translate to today's LLMs. These challenges have prompted an important question: are the limitations observed in prior work due to attack design choices, or are MIAs fundamentally ineffective on LLMs? We address this question by scaling LiRA - one of the strongest MIAs - to GPT-2 architectures ranging from 10M to 1B parameters, training reference models on over 20B tokens from the C4 dataset. Our results advance the understanding of MIAs on LLMs in three key ways: (1) strong MIAs can succeed on pre-trained LLMs; (2) their effectiveness, however, remains limited (e.g., AUC&lt;0.7) in practical settings; and, (3) the relationship between MIA success and related privacy metrics is not as straightforward as prior work has suggested.</description>

      <title>OmniGenBench: A Benchmark for Omnipotent Multimodal Generation across 50+ Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large multimodal models (LMMs), such as the impressive GPT-4o-Native, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in following general-purpose instructions for image generation. However, current benchmarks often lack the necessary breadth and depth to fully evaluate the diverse capabilities of these models. To overcome this limitation, we introduce OmniGenBench, a novel and comprehensive benchmark meticulously designed to assess the instruction-following abilities of state-of-the-art LMMs across both perception-centric and cognition-centric dimensions. Our OmniGenBench includes 57 diverse sub-tasks grounded in real-world scenarios, systematically categorized according to the specific model capabilities they demand. For rigorous evaluation, we further employ a dual-mode protocol. This protocol utilizes off-the-shelf visual parsing tools for perception-centric tasks and a powerful LLM-based judger for cognition-centric tasks to assess the alignment between generated images and user instructions. Using OmniGenBench, we evaluate mainstream generative models, including prevalent models like GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and Seedream, and provide in-depth comparisons and analyses of their performance.Code and data are available at https://github.com/emilia113/OmniGenBench.</description>

      <title>HD-PiSSA: High-Rank Distributed Orthogonal Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for large language models (LLMs), such as LoRA and PiSSA, constrain model updates to low-rank subspaces, limiting their expressiveness and leading to suboptimal performance on complex tasks. To address this, we introduce High-rank Distributed PiSSA (HD-PiSSA), a distributed PEFT approach that initializes orthogonal adapters across different devices and aggregates their delta updates collectively on W for fine-tuning. Unlike Data Parallel LoRA or PiSSA, which maintain identical adapters across all devices, HD-PiSSA assigns different principal components of the pre-trained weights to each GPU, significantly expanding the range of update directions. This results in over 16x higher effective updated ranks than data-parallel LoRA or PiSSA when fine-tuning on 8 GPUs with the same per-device adapter rank. Empirically, we evaluate HD-PiSSA across various challenging downstream tasks, including mathematics, code generation, and multi-task learning. In the multi-task setting, HD-PiSSA achieves average gains of 10.0 absolute points (14.63%) over LoRA and 4.98 points (6.60%) over PiSSA across 12 benchmarks, demonstrating its benefits from the extra optimization flexibility.</description>

      <title>Soft Weighted Machine Unlearning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning, as a post-hoc processing technique, has gained widespread adoption in addressing challenges like bias mitigation and robustness enhancement, colloquially, machine unlearning for fairness and robustness. However, existing non-privacy unlearning-based solutions persist in using binary data removal framework designed for privacy-driven motivation, leading to significant information loss, a phenomenon known as over-unlearning. While over-unlearning has been largely described in many studies as primarily causing utility degradation, we investigate its fundamental causes and provide deeper insights in this work through counterfactual leave-one-out analysis. In this paper, we introduce a weighted influence function that assigns tailored weights to each sample by solving a convex quadratic programming problem analytically. Building on this, we propose a soft-weighted framework enabling fine-grained model adjustments to address the over-unlearning challenge. We demonstrate that the proposed soft-weighted scheme is versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing unlearning algorithms. Extensive experiments show that in fairness- and robustness-driven tasks, the soft-weighted scheme significantly outperforms hard-weighted schemes in fairness/robustness metrics and alleviates the decline in utility metric, thereby enhancing machine unlearning algorithm as an effective correction solution.</description>

      <title>Think Twice before Adaptation: Improving Adaptability of DeepFake Detection via Online Test-Time Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deepfake (DF) detectors face significant challenges when deployed in real-world environments, particularly when encountering test samples deviated from training data through either postprocessing manipulations or distribution shifts. We demonstrate postprocessing techniques can completely obscure generation artifacts presented in DF samples, leading to performance degradation of DF detectors. To address these challenges, we propose Think Twice before Adaptation (\texttt{T$^2$A}), a novel online test-time adaptation method that enhances the adaptability of detectors during inference without requiring access to source training data or labels. Our key idea is to enable the model to explore alternative options through an Uncertainty-aware Negative Learning objective rather than solely relying on its initial predictions as commonly seen in entropy minimization (EM)-based approaches. We also introduce an Uncertain Sample Prioritization strategy and Gradients Masking technique to improve the adaptation by focusing on important samples and model parameters. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed negative learning objective exhibits complementary behavior to EM, facilitating better adaptation capability. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art results compared to existing test-time adaptation (TTA) approaches and significantly enhances the resilience and generalization of DF detectors during inference. Code is available \href{https://github.com/HongHanh2104/T2A-Think-Twice-Before-Adaptation}{here}.</description>

      <title>ALPS: Attention Localization and Pruning Strategy for Efficient Alignment of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning general-purpose large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks often incurs significant costs, including constructing task-specific instruction pairs and extensive training adjustments. Prior research has explored various avenues to enhance alignment efficiency, primarily through minimal-data training or data-driven activations to identify key attention heads. However, these approaches inherently introduce data dependency, which hinders generalization and reusability. To address this issue and enhance model alignment efficiency, we propose the \textit{\textbf{A}ttention \textbf{L}ocalization and \textbf{P}runing \textbf{S}trategy (\textbf{ALPS})}, an efficient algorithm that localizes the most task-sensitive attention heads and prunes by restricting attention training updates to these heads, thereby reducing alignment costs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method activates only \textbf{10\%} of attention parameters during fine-tuning while achieving a \textbf{2\%} performance improvement over baselines on three tasks. Moreover, the identified task-specific heads are transferable across datasets and mitigate knowledge forgetting. Our work and findings provide a novel perspective on efficient LLM alignment.</description>

      <title>High-order Equivariant Flow Matching for Density Functional Theory Hamiltonian Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is a fundamental method for simulating quantum chemical properties, but it remains expensive due to the iterative self-consistent field (SCF) process required to solve the Kohn-Sham equations. Recently, deep learning methods are gaining attention as a way to bypass this step by directly predicting the Hamiltonian. However, they rely on deterministic regression and do not consider the highly structured nature of Hamiltonians. In this work, we propose QHFlow, a high-order equivariant flow matching framework that generates Hamiltonian matrices conditioned on molecular geometry. Flow matching models continuous-time trajectories between simple priors and complex targets, learning the structured distributions over Hamiltonians instead of direct regression. To further incorporate symmetry, we use a neural architecture that predicts SE(3)-equivariant vector fields, improving accuracy and generalization across diverse geometries. To further enhance physical fidelity, we additionally introduce a fine-tuning scheme to align predicted orbital energies with the target. QHFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing Hamiltonian error by 71% on MD17 and 53% on QH9. Moreover, we further show that QHFlow accelerates the DFT process without trading off the solution quality when initializing SCF iterations with the predicted Hamiltonian, significantly reducing the number of iterations and runtime.</description>

      <title>Writing Like the Best: Exemplar-Based Expository Text Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Exemplar-Based Expository Text Generation task, aiming to generate an expository text on a new topic using an exemplar on a similar topic. Current methods fall short due to their reliance on extensive exemplar data, difficulty in adapting topic-specific content, and issues with long-text coherence. To address these challenges, we propose the concept of Adaptive Imitation and present a novel Recurrent Plan-then-Adapt (RePA) framework. RePA leverages large language models (LLMs) for effective adaptive imitation through a fine-grained plan-then-adapt process. RePA also enables recurrent segment-by-segment imitation, supported by two memory structures that enhance input clarity and output coherence. We also develop task-specific evaluation metrics--imitativeness, adaptiveness, and adaptive-imitativeness--using LLMs as evaluators. Experimental results across our collected three diverse datasets demonstrate that RePA surpasses existing baselines in producing factual, consistent, and relevant texts for this task.</description>

      <title>CRMArena-Pro: Holistic Assessment of LLM Agents Across Diverse Business Scenarios and Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While AI agents hold transformative potential in business, effective performance benchmarking is hindered by the scarcity of public, realistic business data on widely used platforms. Existing benchmarks often lack fidelity in their environments, data, and agent-user interactions, with limited coverage of diverse business scenarios and industries. To address these gaps, we introduce CRMArena-Pro, a novel benchmark for holistic, realistic assessment of LLM agents in diverse professional settings. CRMArena-Pro expands on CRMArena with nineteen expert-validated tasks across sales, service, and 'configure, price, and quote' processes, for both Business-to-Business and Business-to-Customer scenarios. It distinctively incorporates multi-turn interactions guided by diverse personas and robust confidentiality awareness assessments. Experiments reveal leading LLM agents achieve only around 58% single-turn success on CRMArena-Pro, with performance dropping significantly to approximately 35% in multi-turn settings. While Workflow Execution proves more tractable for top agents (over 83% single-turn success), other evaluated business skills present greater challenges. Furthermore, agents exhibit near-zero inherent confidentiality awareness; though targeted prompting can improve this, it often compromises task performance. These findings highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and enterprise demands, underscoring the need for advancements in multi-turn reasoning, confidentiality adherence, and versatile skill acquisition.</description>

Abstract: Short videos are an effective tool for promoting contents and improving knowledge accessibility. While existing extractive video summarization methods struggle to produce a coherent narrative, existing abstractive methods cannot `quote' from the input videos, i.e., inserting short video clips in their outputs. In this work, we explore novel video editing models for generating shorts that feature a coherent narrative with embedded video insertions extracted from a long input video. We propose a novel retrieval-embedded generation framework that allows a large language model to quote multimodal resources while maintaining a coherent narrative. Our proposed REGen system first generates the output story script with quote placeholders using a finetuned large language model, and then uses a novel retrieval model to replace the quote placeholders by selecting a video clip that best supports the narrative from a pool of candidate quotable video clips. We examine the proposed method on the task of documentary teaser generation, where short interview insertions are commonly used to support the narrative of a documentary. Our objective evaluations show that the proposed method can effectively insert short video clips while maintaining a coherent narrative. In a subjective survey, we show that our proposed method outperforms existing abstractive and extractive approaches in terms of coherence, alignment, and realism in teaser generation.</description>

      <title>SD-OVON: A Semantics-aware Dataset and Benchmark Generation Pipeline for Open-Vocabulary Object Navigation in Dynamic Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Semantics-aware Dataset and Benchmark Generation Pipeline for Open-vocabulary Object Navigation in Dynamic Scenes (SD-OVON). It utilizes pretraining multimodal foundation models to generate infinite unique photo-realistic scene variants that adhere to real-world semantics and daily commonsense for the training and the evaluation of navigation agents, accompanied with a plugin for generating object navigation task episodes compatible to the Habitat simulator. In addition, we offer two pre-generated object navigation task datasets, SD-OVON-3k and SD-OVON-10k, comprising respectively about 3k and 10k episodes of the open-vocabulary object navigation task, derived from the SD-OVON-Scenes dataset with 2.5k photo-realistic scans of real-world environments and the SD-OVON-Objects dataset with 0.9k manually inspected scanned and artist-created manipulatable object models. Unlike prior datasets limited to static environments, SD-OVON covers dynamic scenes and manipulatable objects, facilitating both real-to-sim and sim-to-real robotic applications. This approach enhances the realism of navigation tasks, the training and the evaluation of open-vocabulary object navigation agents in complex settings. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline and datasets, we propose two baselines and evaluate them along with state-of-the-art baselines on SD-OVON-3k. The datasets, benchmark and source code are publicly available.</description>

      <title>LORE: Lagrangian-Optimized Robust Embeddings for Visual Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual encoders have become fundamental components in modern computer vision pipelines. However, ensuring robustness against adversarial perturbations remains a critical challenge. Recent efforts have explored both supervised and unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning strategies. We identify two key limitations in these approaches: (i) they often suffer from instability, especially during the early stages of fine-tuning, resulting in suboptimal convergence and degraded performance on clean data, and (ii) they exhibit a suboptimal trade-off between robustness and clean data accuracy, hindering the simultaneous optimization of both objectives. To overcome these challenges, we propose Lagrangian-Optimized Robust Embeddings (LORE), a novel unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning framework. LORE utilizes constrained optimization, which offers a principled approach to balancing competing goals, such as improving robustness while preserving nominal performance. By enforcing embedding-space proximity constraints, LORE effectively maintains clean data performance throughout adversarial fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that LORE significantly improves zero-shot adversarial robustness with minimal degradation in clean data accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the adversarially fine-tuned CLIP image encoder in out-of-distribution generalization and enhancing the interpretability of image embeddings.</description>

      <title>Security Concerns for Large Language Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 (and its recent iterations like GPT-4o and the GPT-4.1 series), Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude 3 models, and xAI's Grok have caused a revolution in natural language processing, but their capabilities also introduce new security vulnerabilities. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the emerging security concerns around LLMs, categorizing threats into prompt injection and jailbreaking, adversarial attacks (including input perturbations and data poisoning), misuse by malicious actors (e.g., for disinformation, phishing, and malware generation), and worrisome risks inherent in autonomous LLM agents. A significant focus has been recently placed on the latter, exploring goal misalignment, emergent deception, self-preservation instincts, and the potential for LLMs to develop and pursue covert, misaligned objectives (scheming), which may even persist through safety training. We summarize recent academic and industrial studies (2022-2025) that exemplify each threat, analyze proposed defenses and their limitations, and identify open challenges in securing LLM-based applications. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of advancing robust, multi-layered security strategies to ensure LLMs are safe and beneficial.</description>

      <title>Climate Implications of Diffusion-based Generative Visual AI Systems and their Mass Adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate implications of rapidly developing digital technologies, such as blockchains and the associated crypto mining and NFT minting, have been well documented and their massive GPU energy use has been identified as a cause for concern. However, we postulate that due to their more mainstream consumer appeal, the GPU use of text-prompt based diffusion AI art systems also requires thoughtful considerations. Given the recent explosion in the number of highly sophisticated generative art systems and their rapid adoption by consumers and creative professionals, the impact of these systems on the climate needs to be carefully considered. In this work, we report on the growth of diffusion-based visual AI systems, their patterns of use, growth and the implications on the climate. Our estimates show that the mass adoption of these tools potentially contributes considerably to global energy consumption. We end this paper with our thoughts on solutions and future areas of inquiry as well as associated difficulties, including the lack of publicly available data.</description>

      <title>Reality Check: A New Evaluation Ecosystem Is Necessary to Understand AI's Real World Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional AI evaluation approaches concentrated within the AI stack exhibit systemic limitations for exploring, navigating and resolving the human and societal factors that play out in real world deployment such as in education, finance, healthcare, and employment sectors. AI capability evaluations can capture detail about first-order effects, such as whether immediate system outputs are accurate, or contain toxic, biased or stereotypical content, but AI's second-order effects, i.e. any long-term outcomes and consequences that may result from AI use in the real world, have become a significant area of interest as the technology becomes embedded in our daily lives. These secondary effects can include shifts in user behavior, societal, cultural and economic ramifications, workforce transformations, and long-term downstream impacts that may result from a broad and growing set of risks. This position paper argues that measuring the indirect and secondary effects of AI will require expansion beyond static, single-turn approaches conducted in silico to include testing paradigms that can capture what actually materializes when people use AI technology in context. Specifically, we describe the need for data and methods that can facilitate contextual awareness and enable downstream interpretation and decision making about AI's secondary effects, and recommend requirements for a new ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Improving Ad matching via Cluster-Adaptive Keyword Expansion and Relevance tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In search advertising, keyword matching connects user queries with relevant ads. While token-based matching increases ad coverage, it can reduce relevance due to overly permissive semantic expansion. This work extends keyword reach through document-side semantic keyword expansion, using a language model to broaden token-level matching without altering queries. We propose a solution using a pre-trained siamese model to generate dense vector representations of ad keywords and identify semantically related variants through nearest neighbor search. To maintain precision, we introduce a cluster-based thresholding mechanism that adjusts similarity cutoffs based on local semantic density. Each expanded keyword maps to a group of seller-listed items, which may only partially align with the original intent. To ensure relevance, we enhance the downstream relevance model by adapting it to the expanded keyword space using an incremental learning strategy with a lightweight decision tree ensemble. This system improves both relevance and click-through rate (CTR), offering a scalable, low-latency solution adaptable to evolving query behavior and advertising inventory.</description>

      <title>PromptWise: Online Learning for Cost-Aware Prompt Assignment in Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models has provided users with numerous options to address their prompts. When selecting a generative AI model for a given prompt, users should consider not only the performance of the chosen model but also its associated service cost. The principle guiding such consideration is to select the least expensive model among the available satisfactory options. However, existing model-selection approaches typically prioritize performance, overlooking pricing differences between models. In this paper, we introduce PromptWise, an online learning framework designed to assign a sequence of prompts to a group of large language models (LLMs) in a cost-effective manner. PromptWise strategically queries cheaper models first, progressing to more expensive options only if the lower-cost models fail to adequately address a given prompt. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate PromptWise's effectiveness across various tasks, including puzzles of varying complexity and code generation/translation tasks. The results highlight that PromptWise consistently outperforms cost-unaware baseline methods, emphasizing that directly assigning prompts to the most expensive models can lead to higher costs and potentially lower average performance.</description>

      <title>Robust Stability Analysis of Positive Lure System with Neural Network Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the robustness of the Lur'e problem under positivity constraints, drawing on results from the positive Aizerman conjecture and the robustness properties of Metzler matrices. Specifically, we consider a control system of Lur'e type in which not only the linear part includes parametric uncertainty but also the nonlinear sector bound is unknown. We investigate tools from positive linear systems to effectively solve the problems in complicated and uncertain nonlinear systems. By leveraging the positivity characteristic of the system, we derive an explicit formula for the stability radius of Lur'e systems. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to systems with neural network (NN) feedback loops. Building on this approach, we also propose a refinement method for sector bounds of feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). This study introduces a scalable and efficient approach for robustness analysis of both Lur'e and NN-controlled systems. Finally, the proposed results are supported by illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Behavior Injection: Preparing Language Models for Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has emerged as a powerful post-training technique to incentivize the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs can respond very inconsistently to RFT: some show substantial performance gains, while others plateau or even degrade. To understand this divergence, we analyze the per-step influence of the RL objective and identify two key conditions for effective post-training: (1) RL-informative rollout accuracy, and (2) strong data co-influence, which quantifies how much the training data affects performance on other samples. Guided by these insights, we propose behavior injection, a task-agnostic data-augmentation scheme applied prior to RL. Behavior injection enriches the supervised finetuning (SFT) data by seeding exploratory and exploitative behaviors, effectively making the model more RL-ready. We evaluate our method across two reasoning benchmarks with multiple base models. The results demonstrate that our theoretically motivated augmentation can significantly increases the performance gain from RFT over the pre-RL model.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Large Language Models for Cyberbullying Detection in Real-World YouTube Comments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As online platforms grow, comment sections increasingly host harassment that undermines user experience and well-being. This study benchmarks three leading large language models, OpenAI GPT-4.1, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Anthropic Claude 3 Opus, on a corpus of 5,080 YouTube comments sampled from high-abuse threads in gaming, lifestyle, food vlog, and music channels. The dataset comprises 1,334 harmful and 3,746 non-harmful messages in English, Arabic, and Indonesian, annotated independently by two reviewers with substantial agreement (Cohen's kappa = 0.83). Using a unified prompt and deterministic settings, GPT-4.1 achieved the best overall balance with an F1 score of 0.863, precision of 0.887, and recall of 0.841. Gemini flagged the highest share of harmful posts (recall = 0.875) but its precision fell to 0.767 due to frequent false positives. Claude delivered the highest precision at 0.920 and the lowest false-positive rate of 0.022, yet its recall dropped to 0.720. Qualitative analysis showed that all three models struggle with sarcasm, coded insults, and mixed-language slang. These results underscore the need for moderation pipelines that combine complementary models, incorporate conversational context, and fine-tune for under-represented languages and implicit abuse. A de-identified version of the dataset and full prompts is publicly released to promote reproducibility and further progress in automated content moderation.</description>

      <title>WeedNet: A Foundation Model-Based Global-to-Local AI Approach for Real-Time Weed Species Identification and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early identification of weeds is essential for effective management and control, and there is growing interest in automating the process using computer vision techniques coupled with AI methods. However, challenges associated with training AI-based weed identification models, such as limited expert-verified data and complexity and variability in morphological features, have hindered progress. To address these issues, we present WeedNet, the first global-scale weed identification model capable of recognizing an extensive set of weed species, including noxious and invasive plant species. WeedNet is an end-to-end real-time weed identification pipeline and uses self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, and enhanced trustworthiness strategies. WeedNet achieved 91.02% accuracy across 1,593 weed species, with 41% species achieving 100% accuracy. Using a fine-tuning strategy and a Global-to-Local approach, the local Iowa WeedNet model achieved an overall accuracy of 97.38% for 85 Iowa weeds, most classes exceeded a 90% mean accuracy per class. Testing across intra-species dissimilarity (developmental stages) and inter-species similarity (look-alike species) suggests that diversity in the images collected, spanning all the growth stages and distinguishable plant characteristics, is crucial in driving model performance. The generalizability and adaptability of the Global WeedNet model enable it to function as a foundational model, with the Global-to-Local strategy allowing fine-tuning for region-specific weed communities. Additional validation of drone- and ground-rover-based images highlights the potential of WeedNet for integration into robotic platforms. Furthermore, integration with AI for conversational use provides intelligent agricultural and ecological conservation consulting tools for farmers, agronomists, researchers, land managers, and government agencies across diverse landscapes.</description>

      <title>Chi-Square Wavelet Graph Neural Networks for Heterogeneous Graph Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) in heterogeneous networks presents unique challenges due to node and edge heterogeneity. Existing Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods primarily focus on homogeneous GAD and thus fail to address three key issues: (C1) Capturing abnormal signal and rich semantics across diverse meta-paths; (C2) Retaining high-frequency content in HIN dimension alignment; and (C3) Learning effectively from difficult anomaly samples with class imbalance. To overcome these, we propose ChiGAD, a spectral GNN framework based on a novel Chi-Square filter, inspired by the wavelet effectiveness in diverse domains. Specifically, ChiGAD consists of: (1) Multi-Graph Chi-Square Filter, which captures anomalous information via applying dedicated Chi-Square filters to each meta-path graph; (2) Interactive Meta-Graph Convolution, which aligns features while preserving high-frequency information and incorporates heterogeneous messages by a unified Chi-Square Filter; and (3) Contribution-Informed Cross-Entropy Loss, which prioritizes difficult anomalies to address class imbalance. Extensive experiments on public and industrial datasets show that ChiGAD outperforms state-of-the-art models on multiple metrics. Additionally, its homogeneous variant, ChiGNN, excels on seven GAD datasets, validating the effectiveness of Chi-Square filters. Our code is available at https://github.com/HsipingLi/ChiGAD.</description>

      <title>The Price of Format: Diversity Collapse in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) employ structured templates, such as role markers and special tokens, to enforce format consistency during inference. However, we identify a critical limitation of such formatting: it induces a phenomenon we term diversity collapse, where the model generates semantically similar outputs for open-ended inputs, undermining creativity and variability. We systematically evaluate this effect across tasks like story completion and free-form generation, finding that (1) diversity collapse persists even under high-temperature sampling, and (2) structural tokens in templates significantly constrain the model's output space. To contextualize these findings, we fine-tune the same model using a range of structured prompts and then evaluate them across three axes: downstream task performance, alignment behavior, and output diversity. Our analysis shows that format consistency between fine-tuning and inference is crucial for structure-sensitive tasks (e.g., GSM8K, IFEval), but has marginal influence on knowledge-heavy tasks (e.g., MMLU, WebQuestions). In contrast, output diversity is primarily governed by the presence or absence of structural tokens, with minimal formatting yielding the most diverse outputs. These findings reveal that current prompting conventions, while beneficial for alignment, may inadvertently suppress output diversity, underscoring the need for diversity-aware prompt design and instruction tuning.</description>

      <title>How Do Images Align and Complement LiDAR? Towards a Harmonized Multi-modal 3D Panoptic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D panoptic segmentation often struggles with the inherent sparsity of data from LiDAR sensors, which makes it challenging to accurately recognize distant or small objects. Recently, a few studies have sought to overcome this challenge by integrating LiDAR inputs with camera images, leveraging the rich and dense texture information provided by the latter. While these approaches have shown promising results, they still face challenges, such as misalignment during data augmentation and the reliance on post-processing steps. To address these issues, we propose Image-Assists-LiDAR (IAL), a novel multi-modal 3D panoptic segmentation framework. In IAL, we first introduce a modality-synchronized data augmentation strategy, PieAug, to ensure alignment between LiDAR and image inputs from the start. Next, we adopt a transformer decoder to directly predict panoptic segmentation results. To effectively fuse LiDAR and image features into tokens for the decoder, we design a Geometric-guided Token Fusion (GTF) module. Additionally, we leverage the complementary strengths of each modality as priors for query initialization through a Prior-based Query Generation (PQG) module, enhancing the decoder's ability to generate accurate instance masks. Our IAL framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous multi-modal 3D panoptic segmentation methods on two widely used benchmarks. Code and models are publicly available at &lt;https://github.com/IMPL-Lab/IAL.git&gt;.</description>

      <title>Protein Design with Dynamic Protein Vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein design is a fundamental challenge in biotechnology, aiming to design novel sequences with specific functions within the vast space of possible proteins. Recent advances in deep generative models have enabled function-based protein design from textual descriptions, yet struggle with structural plausibility. Inspired by classical protein design methods that leverage natural protein structures, we explore whether incorporating fragments from natural proteins can enhance foldability in generative models. Our empirical results show that even random incorporation of fragments improves foldability. Building on this insight, we introduce ProDVa, a novel protein design approach that integrates a text encoder for functional descriptions, a protein language model for designing proteins, and a fragment encoder to dynamically retrieve protein fragments based on textual functional descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively designs protein sequences that are both functionally aligned and structurally plausible. Compared to state-of-the-art models, ProDVa achieves comparable function alignment using less than 0.04% of the training data, while designing significantly more well-folded proteins, with the proportion of proteins having pLDDT above 70 increasing by 7.38% and those with PAE below 10 increasing by 9.6%.</description>

      <title>Revival with Voice: Multi-modal Controllable Text-to-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores multi-modal controllable Text-to-Speech Synthesis (TTS) where the voice can be generated from face image, and the characteristics of output speech (e.g., pace, noise level, distance, tone, place) can be controllable with natural text description. Specifically, we aim to mitigate the following three challenges in face-driven TTS systems. 1) To overcome the limited audio quality of audio-visual speech corpora, we propose a training method that additionally utilizes high-quality audio-only speech corpora. 2) To generate voices not only from real human faces but also from artistic portraits, we propose augmenting the input face image with stylization. 3) To consider one-to-many possibilities in face-to-voice mapping and ensure consistent voice generation at the same time, we propose to first employ sampling-based decoding and then use prompting with generated speech samples. Experimental results validate the proposed model's effectiveness in face-driven voice synthesis.</description>

      <title>FastMamba: A High-Speed and Efficient Mamba Accelerator on FPGA with Accurate Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), like recent Mamba2, have achieved remarkable performance and received extensive attention. However, deploying Mamba2 on resource-constrained edge devices encounters many problems: severe outliers within the linear layer challenging the quantization, diverse and irregular element-wise tensor operations, and hardware-unfriendly nonlinear functions in the SSM block. To address these issues, this paper presents FastMamba, a dedicated accelerator on FPGA with hardware-algorithm co-design to promote the deployment efficiency of Mamba2. Specifically, we successfully achieve 8-bit quantization for linear layers through Hadamard transformation to eliminate outliers. Moreover, a hardware-friendly and fine-grained power-of-two quantization framework is presented for the SSM block and convolution layer, and a first-order linear approximation is developed to optimize the nonlinear functions. Based on the accurate algorithm quantization, we propose an accelerator that integrates parallel vector processing units, pipelined execution dataflow, and an efficient SSM Nonlinear Approximation Unit, which enhances computational efficiency and reduces hardware complexity. Finally, we evaluate FastMamba on Xilinx VC709 FPGA. For the input prefill task on Mamba2-130M, FastMamba achieves 68.80\times and 8.90\times speedup over Intel Xeon 4210R CPU and NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, respectively. In the output decode experiment with Mamba2-2.7B, FastMamba attains 6\times higher energy efficiency than RTX 3090 GPU.</description>

      <title>GraSS: Scalable Influence Function with Sparse Gradient Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based data attribution methods, such as influence functions, are critical for understanding the impact of individual training samples without requiring repeated model retraining. However, their scalability is often limited by the high computational and memory costs associated with per-sample gradient computation. In this work, we propose GraSS, a novel gradient compression algorithm and its variants FactGraSS for linear layers specifically, that explicitly leverage the inherent sparsity of per-sample gradients to achieve sub-linear space and time complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving substantial speedups while preserving data influence fidelity. In particular, FactGraSS achieves up to 165% faster throughput on billion-scale models compared to the previous state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/TRAIS-Lab/GraSS.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents FiLLM, a Filipino-optimized large language model, designed to enhance natural language processing (NLP) capabilities in the Filipino language. Built upon the SeaLLM-7B 2.5 model, FiLLM leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning to optimize memory efficiency while maintaining task-specific performance. The model was trained and evaluated on diverse Filipino datasets to address key NLP tasks, including Named Entity Recognition (NER), Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, Dependency Parsing, and Text Summarization. Performance comparisons with the CalamanCy model were conducted using F1 Score, Precision, Recall, Compression Rate, and Keyword Overlap metrics. Results indicate that Calamancy outperforms FILLM in several aspects, demonstrating its effectiveness in processing Filipino text with improved linguistic comprehension and adaptability. This research contributes to the advancement of Filipino NLP applications by providing an optimized, efficient, and scalable language model tailored for local linguistic needs.</description>

      <title>Semi-pessimistic Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn an optimal policy from pre-collected data. However, it faces challenges of distributional shift, where the learned policy may encounter unseen scenarios not covered in the offline data. Additionally, numerous applications suffer from a scarcity of labeled reward data. Relying on labeled data alone often leads to a narrow state-action distribution, further amplifying the distributional shift, and resulting in suboptimal policy learning. To address these issues, we first recognize that the volume of unlabeled data is typically substantially larger than that of labeled data. We then propose a semi-pessimistic RL method to effectively leverage abundant unlabeled data. Our approach offers several advantages. It considerably simplifies the learning process, as it seeks a lower bound of the reward function, rather than that of the Q-function or state transition function. It is highly flexible, and can be integrated with a range of model-free and model-based RL algorithms. It enjoys the guaranteed improvement when utilizing vast unlabeled data, but requires much less restrictive conditions. We compare our method with a number of alternative solutions, both analytically and numerically, and demonstrate its clear competitiveness. We further illustrate with an application to adaptive deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease.</description>

      <title>Faithful Group Shapley Value</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data Shapley is an important tool for data valuation, which quantifies the contribution of individual data points to machine learning models. In practice, group-level data valuation is desirable when data providers contribute data in batch. However, we identify that existing group-level extensions of Data Shapley are vulnerable to shell company attacks, where strategic group splitting can unfairly inflate valuations. We propose Faithful Group Shapley Value (FGSV) that uniquely defends against such attacks. Building on original mathematical insights, we develop a provably fast and accurate approximation algorithm for computing FGSV. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in computational efficiency and approximation accuracy, while ensuring faithful group-level valuation.</description>

      <title>HGCL: Hierarchical Graph Contrastive Learning for User-Item Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), which fuses graph neural networks with contrastive learning, has evolved as a pivotal tool in user-item recommendations. While promising, existing GCL methods often lack explicit modeling of hierarchical item structures, which represent item similarities across varying resolutions. Such hierarchical item structures are ubiquitous in various items (e.g., online products and local businesses), and reflect their inherent organizational properties that serve as critical signals for enhancing recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Graph Contrastive Learning (HGCL), a novel GCL method that incorporates hierarchical item structures for user-item recommendations. First, HGCL pre-trains a GCL module using cross-layer contrastive learning to obtain user and item representations. Second, HGCL employs a representation compression and clustering method to construct a two-hierarchy user-item bipartite graph. Ultimately, HGCL fine-tunes user and item representations by learning on the hierarchical graph, and then provides recommendations based on user-item interaction scores. Experiments on three widely adopted benchmark datasets ranging from 70K to 382K nodes confirm the superior performance of HGCL over existing baseline models, highlighting the contribution of hierarchical item structures in enhancing GCL methods for recommendation tasks.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Metrics and Benchmarks of Video Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), which aims to detect anomalies that deviate from expectation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing advancements in VAD primarily focus on model architectures and training strategies, while devoting insufficient attention to evaluation metrics and benchmarks. In this paper, we rethink VAD evaluation protocols through comprehensive experimental analyses, revealing three critical limitations in current practices: 1) existing metrics are significantly influenced by single annotation bias; 2) current metrics fail to reward early detection of anomalies; 3) available benchmarks lack the capability to evaluate scene overfitting. To address these limitations, we propose three novel evaluation methods: first, we establish averaged AUC/AP metrics over multi-round annotations to mitigate single annotation bias; second, we develop a Latency-aware Average Precision (LaAP) metric that rewards early and accurate anomaly detection; and finally, we introduce two hard normal benchmarks (UCF-HN, MSAD-HN) with videos specifically designed to evaluate scene overfitting. We report performance comparisons of ten state-of-the-art VAD approaches using our proposed evaluation methods, providing novel perspectives for future VAD model development.</description>

      <title>A Smart Healthcare System for Monkeypox Skin Lesion Detection and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monkeypox is a viral disease characterized by distinctive skin lesions and has been reported in many countries. The recent global outbreak has emphasized the urgent need for scalable, accessible, and accurate diagnostic solutions to support public health responses.
  In this study, we developed ITMAINN, an intelligent, AI-driven healthcare system specifically designed to detect Monkeypox from skin lesion images using advanced deep learning techniques. Our system consists of three main components. First, we trained and evaluated several pretrained models using transfer learning on publicly available skin lesion datasets to identify the most effective models. For binary classification (Monkeypox vs. non-Monkeypox), the Vision Transformer, MobileViT, Transformer-in-Transformer, and VGG16 achieved the highest performance, each with an accuracy and F1-score of 97.8%. For multiclass classification, which contains images of patients with Monkeypox and five other classes (chickenpox, measles, hand-foot-mouth disease, cowpox, and healthy), ResNetViT and ViT Hybrid models achieved 92% accuracy, with F1 scores of 92.24% and 92.19%, respectively. The best-performing and most lightweight model, MobileViT, was deployed within the mobile application. The second component is a cross-platform smartphone application that enables users to detect Monkeypox through image analysis, track symptoms, and receive recommendations for nearby healthcare centers based on their location. The third component is a real-time monitoring dashboard designed for health authorities to support them in tracking cases, analyzing symptom trends, guiding public health interventions, and taking proactive measures.
  This system is fundamental in developing responsive healthcare infrastructure within smart cities. Our solution, ITMAINN, is part of revolutionizing public health management.</description>

      <title>InfoChartQA: A Benchmark for Multimodal Question Answering on Infographic Charts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding infographic charts with design-driven visual elements (e.g., pictograms, icons) requires both visual recognition and reasoning, posing challenges for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing visual-question answering benchmarks fall short in evaluating these capabilities of MLLMs due to the lack of paired plain charts and visual-element-based questions. To bridge this gap, we introduce InfoChartQA, a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on infographic chart understanding. It includes 5,642 pairs of infographic and plain charts, each sharing the same underlying data but differing in visual presentations. We further design visual-element-based questions to capture their unique visual designs and communicative intent. Evaluation of 20 MLLMs reveals a substantial performance decline on infographic charts, particularly for visual-element-based questions related to metaphors. The paired infographic and plain charts enable fine-grained error analysis and ablation studies, which highlight new opportunities for advancing MLLMs in infographic chart understanding. We release InfoChartQA at https://github.com/CoolDawnAnt/InfoChartQA.</description>

      <title>Medical Large Vision Language Models with Multi-Image Visual Ability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising performance across various single-image question answering (QA) benchmarks, yet their capability in processing multi-image clinical scenarios remains underexplored. Unlike single image based tasks, medical tasks involving multiple images often demand sophisticated visual understanding capabilities, such as temporal reasoning and cross-modal analysis, which are poorly supported by current medical LVLMs. To bridge this critical gap, we present the Med-MIM instruction dataset, comprising 83.2K medical multi-image QA pairs that span four types of multi-image visual abilities (temporal understanding, reasoning, comparison, co-reference). Using this dataset, we fine-tune Mantis and LLaVA-Med, resulting in two specialized medical VLMs: MIM-LLaVA-Med and Med-Mantis, both optimized for multi-image analysis. Additionally, we develop the Med-MIM benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the medical multi-image understanding capabilities of LVLMs. We assess eight popular LVLMs, including our two models, on the Med-MIM benchmark. Experimental results show that both Med-Mantis and MIM-LLaVA-Med achieve superior performance on the held-in and held-out subsets of the Med-MIM benchmark, demonstrating that the Med-MIM instruction dataset effectively enhances LVLMs' multi-image understanding capabilities in the medical domain.</description>

      <title>Turb-L1: Achieving Long-term Turbulence Tracing By Tackling Spectral Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the long-term evolution of turbulence is crucial for advancing scientific understanding and optimizing engineering applications. However, existing deep learning methods face significant bottlenecks in long-term autoregressive prediction, which exhibit excessive smoothing and fail to accurately track complex fluid dynamics. Our extensive experimental and spectral analysis of prevailing methods provides an interpretable explanation for this shortcoming, identifying Spectral Bias as the core obstacle. Concretely, spectral bias is the inherent tendency of models to favor low-frequency, smooth features while overlooking critical high-frequency details during training, thus reducing fidelity and causing physical distortions in long-term predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Turb-L1, an innovative turbulence prediction method, which utilizes a Hierarchical Dynamics Synthesis mechanism within a multi-grid architecture to explicitly overcome spectral bias. It accurately captures cross-scale interactions and preserves the fidelity of high-frequency dynamics, enabling reliable long-term tracking of turbulence evolution. Extensive experiments on the 2D turbulence benchmark show that Turb-L1 demonstrates excellent performance: (I) In long-term predictions, it reduces Mean Squared Error (MSE) by $80.3\%$ and increases Structural Similarity (SSIM) by over $9\times$ compared to the SOTA baseline, significantly improving prediction fidelity. (II) It effectively overcomes spectral bias, accurately reproducing the full enstrophy spectrum and maintaining physical realism in high-wavenumber regions, thus avoiding the spectral distortions or spurious energy accumulation seen in other methods.</description>

      <title>Smart Waste Management System for Makkah City using Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waste management is a critical global issue with significant environmental and public health implications. It has become more destructive during large-scale events such as the annual pilgrimage to Makkah, Saudi Arabia, one of the world's largest religious gatherings. This event's popularity has attracted millions worldwide, leading to significant and un-predictable accumulation of waste. Such a tremendous number of visitors leads to in-creased waste management issues at the Grand Mosque and other holy sites, highlighting the need for an effective solution other than traditional methods based on rigid collection schedules.
  To address this challenge, this research proposed an innovative solution that is context-specific and tailored to the unique requirements of pilgrimage season: a Smart Waste Management System, called TUHR, that utilizes the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. This system encompasses ultrasonic sensors that monitor waste levels in each container at the performance sites. Once the container reaches full capacity, the sensor communicates with the microcontroller, which alerts the relevant authorities. Moreover, our system can detect harmful substances such as gas from the gas detector sensor. Such a proactive and dynamic approach promises to mitigate the environmental and health risks associated with waste accumulation and enhance the cleanliness of these sites. It also delivers economic benefits by reducing unnecessary gasoline consumption and optimizing waste management resources. Importantly, this research aligns with the principles of smart cities and exemplifies the innovative, sustainable, and health-conscious approach that Saudi Arabia is implementing as part of its Vision 2030 initiative.</description>

      <title>An Embarrassingly Simple Defense Against LLM Abliteration Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to comply with safety guidelines by refusing harmful instructions. A recent attack, termed abliteration, isolates and suppresses the single latent direction most responsible for refusal behavior, enabling the model to generate unethical content. We propose a defense that modifies how models generate refusals. We construct an extended-refusal dataset that contains harmful prompts with a full response that justifies the reason for refusal. We then fine-tune Llama-2-7B-Chat and Qwen2.5-Instruct (1.5B and 3B parameters) on our extended-refusal dataset, and evaluate the resulting systems on a set of harmful prompts. In our experiments, extended-refusal models maintain high refusal rates, dropping at most by 10%, whereas baseline models' refusal rates drop by 70-80% after abliteration. A broad evaluation of safety and utility shows that extended-refusal fine-tuning neutralizes the abliteration attack while preserving general performance.</description>

      <title>An Initial Exploration of Fine-tuning Small Language Models for Smart Contract Reentrancy Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used more and more for various coding tasks, including to help coders identify bugs and are a promising avenue to support coders in various tasks including vulnerability detection -- particularly given the flexibility of such generative AI models and tools. Yet for many tasks it may not be suitable to use LLMs, for which it may be more suitable to use smaller language models that can fit and easily execute and train on a developer's computer. In this paper we explore and evaluate whether smaller language models can be fine-tuned to achieve reasonable results for a niche area: vulnerability detection -- specifically focusing on detecting the reentrancy bug in Solidity smart contracts.</description>

      <title>Jodi: Unification of Visual Generation and Understanding via Joint Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual generation and understanding are two deeply interconnected aspects of human intelligence, yet they have been traditionally treated as separate tasks in machine learning. In this paper, we propose Jodi, a diffusion framework that unifies visual generation and understanding by jointly modeling the image domain and multiple label domains. Specifically, Jodi is built upon a linear diffusion transformer along with a role switch mechanism, which enables it to perform three particular types of tasks: (1) joint generation, where the model simultaneously generates images and multiple labels; (2) controllable generation, where images are generated conditioned on any combination of labels; and (3) image perception, where multiple labels can be predicted at once from a given image. Furthermore, we present the Joint-1.6M dataset, which contains 200,000 high-quality images collected from public sources, automatic labels for 7 visual domains, and LLM-generated captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Jodi excels in both generation and understanding tasks and exhibits strong extensibility to a wider range of visual domains.

      <title>MaskedManipulator: Versatile Whole-Body Control for Loco-Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans interact with their world while leveraging precise full-body control to achieve versatile goals. This versatility allows them to solve long-horizon, underspecified problems, such as placing a cup in a sink, by seamlessly sequencing actions like approaching the cup, grasping, transporting it, and finally placing it in the sink. Such goal-driven control can enable new procedural tools for animation systems, enabling users to define partial objectives while the system naturally ``fills in'' the intermediate motions. However, while current methods for whole-body dexterous manipulation in physics-based animation achieve success in specific interaction tasks, they typically employ control paradigms (e.g., detailed kinematic motion tracking, continuous object trajectory following, or direct VR teleoperation) that offer limited versatility for high-level goal specification across the entire coupled human-object system. To bridge this gap, we present MaskedManipulator, a unified and generative policy developed through a two-stage learning approach. First, our system trains a tracking controller to physically reconstruct complex human-object interactions from large-scale human mocap datasets. This tracking controller is then distilled into MaskedManipulator, which provides users with intuitive control over both the character's body and the manipulated object. As a result, MaskedManipulator enables users to specify complex loco-manipulation tasks through intuitive high-level objectives (e.g., target object poses, key character stances), and MaskedManipulator then synthesizes the necessary full-body actions for a physically simulated humanoid to achieve these goals, paving the way for more interactive and life-like virtual characters.</description>

      <title>ReadBench: Measuring the Dense Text Visual Reading Ability of Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have greatly enhanced their capability to jointly process text and images. However, despite extensive benchmarks evaluating visual comprehension (e.g., diagrams, color schemes, OCR tasks...), there is limited assessment of VLMs' ability to read and reason about text-rich images effectively. To fill this gap, we introduce ReadBench, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the reading comprehension capabilities of VLMs. ReadBench transposes contexts from established text-only benchmarks into images of text while keeping textual prompts and questions intact. Evaluating leading VLMs with ReadBench, we find minimal-but-present performance degradation on short, text-image inputs, while performance sharply declines for longer, multi-page contexts. Our experiments further reveal that text resolution has negligible effects on multimodal performance. These findings highlight needed improvements in VLMs, particularly their reasoning over visually presented extensive textual content, a capability critical for practical applications. ReadBench is available at https://github.com/answerdotai/ReadBench .</description>

      <title>SATORI-R1: Incentivizing Multimodal Reasoning with Spatial Grounding and Verifiable Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated powerful reasoning capabilities in the text domain through stable reinforcement learning (RL). Recently, in the multimodal domain, works have begun to directly apply RL to generate R1-like free-form reasoning for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. However, multimodal tasks share an intrinsically different nature from textual tasks, which heavily rely on the understanding of the input image to solve the problem. Therefore, such free-form reasoning faces two critical limitations in the VQA task: (1) Extended reasoning chains diffuse visual focus away from task-critical regions, degrading answer accuracy. (2) Unverifiable intermediate steps amplify policy-gradient variance and computational costs overhead. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce SATORI ($\textbf{S}patially$ $\textbf{A}nchored$ $\textbf{T}ask$ $\textbf{O}ptimization$ with $\textbf{R}e\textbf{I}nforcement$ Learning), which decomposes VQA into three verifiable stages, including global image captioning, region localization, and answer prediction, each supplying explicit reward signals. Furthermore, we also introduce VQA-Verify, a 12k dataset annotated with answer-aligned captions and bounding-boxes to facilitate training. Experiments demonstrate consistent performance improvements across seven VQA benchmarks, achieving up to $15.7\%$ improvement in accuracy in accuracy compared to the R1-like baseline. Our analysis of the attention map confirms enhanced focus on critical regions, which brings improvements in accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/justairr/SATORI-R1.</description>

      <title>Enable Lightweight and Precision-Scalable Posit/IEEE-754 Arithmetic in RISC-V Cores for Transprecision Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While posit format offers superior dynamic range and accuracy for transprecision computing, its adoption in RISC-V processors is hindered by the lack of a unified solution for lightweight, precision-scalable, and IEEE-754 arithmetic compatible hardware implementation. To address these challenges, we enhance RISC-V processors by 1) integrating dedicated posit codecs into the original FPU for lightweight implementation, 2) incorporating multi/mixed-precision support with dynamic exponent size for precision-scalability, and 3) reusing and customizing ISA extensions for IEEE-754 compatible posit operations. Our comprehensive evaluation spans the modified FPU, RISC-V core, and SoC levels. It demonstrates that our implementation achieves 47.9% LUTs and 57.4% FFs reduction compared to state-of-the-art posit-enabled RISC-V processors, while achieving up to 2.54$\times$ throughput improvement in various GEMM kernels.</description>

      <title>CCHall: A Novel Benchmark for Joint Cross-Lingual and Cross-Modal Hallucinations Detection in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating hallucination issues in large language models (LLMs) within cross-lingual and cross-modal scenarios can greatly advance the large-scale deployment in real-world applications. Nevertheless, the current studies are limited to a single scenario, either cross-lingual or cross-modal, leaving a gap in the exploration of hallucinations in the joint cross-lingual and cross-modal scenarios. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel joint Cross-lingual and Cross-modal Hallucinations benchmark (CCHall) to fill this gap. Specifically, CCHall simultaneously incorporates both cross-lingual and cross-modal hallucination scenarios, which can be used to assess the cross-lingual and cross-modal capabilities of LLMs. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on CCHall, exploring both mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs. The experimental results highlight that current LLMs still struggle with CCHall. We hope CCHall can serve as a valuable resource to assess LLMs in joint cross-lingual and cross-modal scenarios.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Representation Learning Approach for Diffusion Tensor Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) tractography offers detailed insights into the structural connectivity of the brain, but presents challenges in effective representation and interpretation in deep learning models. In this work, we propose a novel 2D representation of DTI tractography that encodes tract-level fractional anisotropy (FA) values into a 9x9 grayscale image. This representation is processed through a Beta-Total Correlation Variational Autoencoder with a Spatial Broadcast Decoder to learn a disentangled and interpretable latent embedding. We evaluate the quality of this embedding using supervised and unsupervised representation learning strategies, including auxiliary classification, triplet loss, and SimCLR-based contrastive learning. Compared to the 1D Group deep neural network (DNN) baselines, our approach improves the F1 score in a downstream sex classification task by 15.74% and shows a better disentanglement than the 3D representation.</description>

      <title>FP4 All the Way: Fully Quantized Training of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate, for the first time, fully quantized training (FQT) of large language models (LLMs) using predominantly 4-bit floating-point (FP4) precision for weights, activations, and gradients on datasets up to 200 billion tokens. We extensively investigate key design choices for FP4, including block sizes, scaling formats, and rounding methods. Our analysis shows that the NVFP4 format, where each block of 16 FP4 values (E2M1) shares a scale represented in E4M3, provides optimal results. We use stochastic rounding for backward and update passes and round-to-nearest for the forward pass to enhance stability. Additionally, we identify a theoretical and empirical threshold for effective quantized training: when the gradient norm falls below approximately $\sqrt{3}$ times the quantization noise, quantized training becomes less effective. Leveraging these insights, we successfully train a 7-billion-parameter model on 256 Intel Gaudi2 accelerators. The resulting FP4-trained model achieves downstream task performance comparable to a standard BF16 baseline, confirming that FP4 training is a practical and highly efficient approach for large-scale LLM training. A reference implementation is supplied in https://github.com/Anonymous1252022/fp4-all-the-way .</description>

      <title>CloneShield: A Framework for Universal Perturbation Against Zero-Shot Voice Cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-speech (TTS) voice cloning have raised serious privacy concerns, allowing highly accurate vocal identity replication from just a few seconds of reference audio, while retaining the speaker's vocal authenticity. In this paper, we introduce CloneShield, a universal time-domain adversarial perturbation framework specifically designed to defend against zero-shot voice cloning. Our method provides protection that is robust across speakers and utterances, without requiring any prior knowledge of the synthesized text. We formulate perturbation generation as a multi-objective optimization problem, and propose Multi-Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) to ensure the robust protection across diverse utterances. To preserve natural auditory perception for users, we decompose the adversarial perturbation via Mel-spectrogram representations and fine-tune it for each sample. This design ensures imperceptibility while maintaining strong degradation effects on zero-shot cloned outputs. Experiments on three state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS systems, five benchmark datasets and evaluations from 60 human listeners demonstrate that our method preserves near-original audio quality in protected inputs (PESQ = 3.90, SRS = 0.93) while substantially degrading both speaker similarity and speech quality in cloned samples (PESQ = 1.07, SRS = 0.08).</description>

      <title>RetrieveAll: A Multilingual Named Entity Recognition Framework with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of large language models has led to significant performance breakthroughs in named entity recognition (NER) for high-resource languages, yet there remains substantial room for improvement in low- and medium-resource languages. Existing multilingual NER methods face severe language interference during the multi-language adaptation process, manifested in feature conflicts between different languages and the competitive suppression of low-resource language features by high-resource languages. Although training a dedicated model for each language can mitigate such interference, it lacks scalability and incurs excessive computational costs in real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose RetrieveAll, a universal multilingual NER framework based on dynamic LoRA. The framework decouples task-specific features across languages and demonstrates efficient dynamic adaptability. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-granularity knowledge augmented method that fully exploits the intrinsic potential of the data without relying on external resources. By leveraging a hierarchical prompting mechanism to guide knowledge injection, this approach advances the paradigm from "prompt-guided inference" to "prompt-driven learning." Experimental results show that RetrieveAll outperforms existing baselines; on the PAN-X dataset, it achieves an average F1 improvement of 12.1 percent.</description>

      <title>Shifting AI Efficiency From Model-Centric to Data-Centric Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) has historically relied on model-centric scaling through increasing parameter counts from millions to hundreds of billions to drive performance gains. However, as we approach hardware limits on model size, the dominant computational bottleneck has fundamentally shifted to the quadratic cost of self-attention over long token sequences, now driven by ultra-long text contexts, high-resolution images, and extended videos. In this position paper, \textbf{we argue that the focus of research for efficient AI is shifting from model-centric compression to data-centric compression}. We position token compression as the new frontier, which improves AI efficiency via reducing the number of tokens during model training or inference. Through comprehensive analysis, we first examine recent developments in long-context AI across various domains and establish a unified mathematical framework for existing model efficiency strategies, demonstrating why token compression represents a crucial paradigm shift in addressing long-context overhead. Subsequently, we systematically review the research landscape of token compression, analyzing its fundamental benefits and identifying its compelling advantages across diverse scenarios. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of current challenges in token compression research and outline promising future directions.

      <title>SRDiffusion: Accelerate Video Diffusion Inference via Sketching-Rendering Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture, models like Sora, CogVideoX and Wan have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-video, image-to-video, and video editing tasks. Despite these advances, diffusion-based video generation remains computationally intensive, especially for high-resolution, long-duration videos. Prior work accelerates its inference by skipping computation, usually at the cost of severe quality degradation. In this paper, we propose SRDiffusion, a novel framework that leverages collaboration between large and small models to reduce inference cost. The large model handles high-noise steps to ensure semantic and motion fidelity (Sketching), while the smaller model refines visual details in low-noise steps (Rendering). Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, over 3$\times$ speedup for Wan with nearly no quality loss for VBench, and 2$\times$ speedup for CogVideoX. Our method is introduced as a new direction orthogonal to existing acceleration strategies, offering a practical solution for scalable video generation.</description>

      <title>SpokenNativQA: Multilingual Everyday Spoken Queries for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various disciplines and tasks. However, benchmarking their capabilities with multilingual spoken queries remains largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce SpokenNativQA, the first multilingual and culturally aligned spoken question-answering (SQA) dataset designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world conversational settings. The dataset comprises approximately 33,000 naturally spoken questions and answers in multiple languages, including low-resource and dialect-rich languages, providing a robust benchmark for assessing LLM performance in speech-based interactions. SpokenNativQA addresses the limitations of text-based QA datasets by incorporating speech variability, accents, and linguistic diversity. We benchmark different ASR systems and LLMs for SQA and present our findings. We released the data at (https://huggingface.co/datasets/QCRI/SpokenNativQA) and the experimental scripts at (https://llmebench.qcri.org/) for the research community.</description>

      <title>BroadGen: A Framework for Generating Effective and Efficient Advertiser Broad Match Keyphrase Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the domain of sponsored search advertising, the focus of Keyphrase recommendation has largely been on exact match types, which pose issues such as high management expenses, limited targeting scope, and evolving search query patterns. Alternatives like Broad match types can alleviate certain drawbacks of exact matches but present challenges like poor targeting accuracy and minimal supervisory signals owing to limited advertiser usage. This research defines the criteria for an ideal broad match, emphasizing on both efficiency and effectiveness, ensuring that a significant portion of matched queries are relevant. We propose BroadGen, an innovative framework that recommends efficient and effective broad match keyphrases by utilizing historical search query data. Additionally, we demonstrate that BroadGen, through token correspondence modeling, maintains better query stability over time. BroadGen's capabilities allow it to serve daily, millions of sellers at eBay with over 2.3 billion items.</description>

      <title>Saliency-guided Emotion Modeling: Predicting Viewer Reactions from Video Stimuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the emotional impact of videos is crucial for applications in content creation, advertising, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Traditional affective computing methods rely on self-reported emotions, facial expression analysis, and biosensing data, yet they often overlook the role of visual saliency -- the naturally attention-grabbing regions within a video. In this study, we utilize deep learning to introduce a novel saliency-based approach to emotion prediction by extracting two key features: saliency area and number of salient regions. Using the HD2S saliency model and OpenFace facial action unit analysis, we examine the relationship between video saliency and viewer emotions. Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) Videos with multiple salient regions tend to elicit high-valence, low-arousal emotions, (2) Videos with a single dominant salient region are more likely to induce low-valence, high-arousal responses, and (3) Self-reported emotions often misalign with facial expression-based emotion detection, suggesting limitations in subjective reporting. By leveraging saliency-driven insights, this work provides a computationally efficient and interpretable alternative for emotion modeling, with implications for content creation, personalized media experiences, and affective computing research.</description>

      <title>Two LLMs debate, both are certain they've won</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can LLMs accurately adjust their confidence when facing opposition? Building on previous studies measuring calibration on static fact-based question-answering tasks, we evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in a dynamic, adversarial debate setting, uniquely combining two realistic factors: (a) a multi-turn format requiring models to update beliefs as new information emerges, and (b) a zero-sum structure to control for task-related uncertainty, since mutual high-confidence claims imply systematic overconfidence. We organized 60 three-round policy debates among ten state-of-the-art LLMs, with models privately rating their confidence (0-100) in winning after each round. We observed five concerning patterns: (1) Systematic overconfidence: models began debates with average initial confidence of 72.9% vs. a rational 50% baseline. (2) Confidence escalation: rather than reducing confidence as debates progressed, debaters increased their win probabilities, averaging 83% by the final round. (3) Mutual overestimation: in 61.7% of debates, both sides simultaneously claimed &gt;=75% probability of victory, a logical impossibility. (4) Persistent self-debate bias: models debating identical copies increased confidence from 64.1% to 75.2%; even when explicitly informed their chance of winning was exactly 50%, confidence still rose (from 50.0% to 57.1%). (5) Misaligned private reasoning: models' private scratchpad thoughts sometimes differed from their public confidence ratings, raising concerns about faithfulness of chain-of-thought reasoning. These results suggest LLMs lack the ability to accurately self-assess or update their beliefs in dynamic, multi-turn tasks; a major concern as LLM outputs are deployed without careful review in assistant roles or agentic settings.</description>

      <title>PosePilot: An Edge-AI Solution for Posture Correction in Physical Exercises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated pose correction remains a significant challenge in AI-driven fitness systems, despite extensive research in activity recognition. This work presents PosePilot, a novel system that integrates pose recognition with real-time personalized corrective feedback, overcoming the limitations of traditional fitness solutions. Using Yoga, a discipline requiring precise spatio-temporal alignment as a case study, we demonstrate PosePilot's ability to analyze complex physical movements. Designed for deployment on edge devices, PosePilot can be extended to various at-home and outdoor exercises. We employ a Vanilla LSTM, allowing the system to capture temporal dependencies for pose recognition. Additionally, a BiLSTM with multi-head Attention enhances the model's ability to process motion contexts, selectively focusing on key limb angles for accurate error detection while maintaining computational efficiency. As part of this work, we introduce a high-quality video dataset used for evaluating our models. Most importantly, PosePilot provides instant corrective feedback at every stage of a movement, ensuring precise posture adjustments throughout the exercise routine. The proposed approach 1) performs automatic human posture recognition, 2) provides personalized posture correction feedback at each instant which is crucial in Yoga, and 3) offers a lightweight and robust posture correction model feasible for deploying on edge devices in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>LIMOPro: Reasoning Refinement for Efficient and Effective Test-time Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities through test-time scaling approaches, particularly when fine-tuned with chain-of-thought (CoT) data distilled from more powerful large reasoning models (LRMs). However, these reasoning chains often contain verbose elements that mirror human problem-solving, categorized as progressive reasoning (the essential solution development path) and functional elements (verification processes, alternative solution approaches, and error corrections). While progressive reasoning is crucial, the functional elements significantly increase computational demands during test-time inference. We introduce PIR (Perplexity-based Importance Refinement), a principled framework that quantitatively evaluates the importance of each reasoning step based on its impact on answer prediction confidence. PIR systematically identifies and selectively prunes only low-importance functional steps while preserving progressive reasoning components, creating optimized training data that maintains the integrity of the core solution path while reducing verbosity. Models fine-tuned on PIR-optimized data exhibit superior test-time scaling properties, generating more concise reasoning chains while achieving improved accuracy (+0.9\% to +6.6\%) with significantly reduced token usage (-3\% to -41\%) across challenging reasoning benchmarks (AIME, AMC, and GPQA Diamond). Our approach demonstrates strong generalizability across different model sizes, data sources, and token budgets, offering a practical solution for deploying reasoning-capable LLMs in scenarios where efficient test-time scaling, response time, and computational efficiency are valuable constraints.</description>

      <title>I2MoE: Interpretable Multimodal Interaction-aware Mixture-of-Experts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modality fusion is a cornerstone of multimodal learning, enabling information integration from diverse data sources. However, vanilla fusion methods are limited by (1) inability to account for heterogeneous interactions between modalities and (2) lack of interpretability in uncovering the multimodal interactions inherent in the data. To this end, we propose I2MoE (Interpretable Multimodal Interaction-aware Mixture of Experts), an end-to-end MoE framework designed to enhance modality fusion by explicitly modeling diverse multimodal interactions, as well as providing interpretation on a local and global level. First, I2MoE utilizes different interaction experts with weakly supervised interaction losses to learn multimodal interactions in a data-driven way. Second, I2MoE deploys a reweighting model that assigns importance scores for the output of each interaction expert, which offers sample-level and dataset-level interpretation. Extensive evaluation of medical and general multimodal datasets shows that I2MoE is flexible enough to be combined with different fusion techniques, consistently improves task performance, and provides interpretation across various real-world scenarios.

      <title>Curvature Dynamic Black-box Attack: revisiting adversarial robustness via dynamic curvature estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attack reveals the vulnerability of deep learning models. For about a decade, countless attack and defense methods have been proposed, leading to robustified classifiers and better understanding of models. Among these methods, curvature-based approaches have attracted attention because it is assumed that high curvature may give rise to rough decision boundary. However, the most commonly used \textit{curvature} is the curvature of loss function, scores or other parameters from within the model as opposed to decision boundary curvature, since the former can be relatively easily formed using second order derivative. In this paper, we propose a new query-efficient method, dynamic curvature estimation(DCE), to estimate the decision boundary curvature in a black-box setting. Our approach is based on CGBA, a black-box adversarial attack. By performing DCE on a wide range of classifiers, we discovered, statistically, a connection between decision boundary curvature and adversarial robustness. We also propose a new attack method, curvature dynamic black-box attack(CDBA) with improved performance using the dynamically estimated curvature.</description>

      <title>EnvSDD: Benchmarking Environmental Sound Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio generation systems now create very realistic soundscapes that can enhance media production, but also pose potential risks. Several studies have examined deepfakes in speech or singing voice. However, environmental sounds have different characteristics, which may make methods for detecting speech and singing deepfakes less effective for real-world sounds. In addition, existing datasets for environmental sound deepfake detection are limited in scale and audio types. To address this gap, we introduce EnvSDD, the first large-scale curated dataset designed for this task, consisting of 45.25 hours of real and 316.74 hours of fake audio. The test set includes diverse conditions to evaluate the generalizability, such as unseen generation models and unseen datasets. We also propose an audio deepfake detection system, based on a pre-trained audio foundation model. Results on EnvSDD show that our proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art systems from speech and singing domains.</description>

      <title>OptiMindTune: A Multi-Agent Framework for Intelligent Hyperparameter Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a critical yet challenging aspect of machine learning model development, significantly impacting model performance and generalization. Traditional HPO methods often struggle with high dimensionality, complex interdependencies, and computational expense. This paper introduces OptiMindTune, a novel multi-agent framework designed to intelligently and efficiently optimize hyperparameters. OptiMindTune leverages the collaborative intelligence of three specialized AI agents -- a Recommender Agent, an Evaluator Agent, and a Decision Agent -- each powered by Google's Gemini models. These agents address distinct facets of the HPO problem, from model selection and hyperparameter suggestion to robust evaluation and strategic decision-making. By fostering dynamic interactions and knowledge sharing, OptiMindTune aims to converge to optimal hyperparameter configurations more rapidly and robustly than existing single-agent or monolithic approaches. Our framework integrates principles from advanced large language models, and adaptive search to achieve scalable and intelligent AutoML. We posit that this multi-agent paradigm offers a promising avenue for tackling the increasing complexity of modern machine learning model tuning.</description>

      <title>MOOSE-Chem2: Exploring LLM Limits in Fine-Grained Scientific Hypothesis Discovery via Hierarchical Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating scientific hypothesis generation, yet existing approaches primarily yield coarse-grained hypotheses lacking critical methodological and experimental details. We introduce and formally define the novel task of fine-grained scientific hypothesis discovery, which entails generating detailed, experimentally actionable hypotheses from coarse initial research directions. We frame this as a combinatorial optimization problem and investigate the upper limits of LLMs' capacity to solve it when maximally leveraged. Specifically, we explore four foundational questions: (1) how to best harness an LLM's internal heuristics to formulate the fine-grained hypothesis it itself would judge as the most promising among all the possible hypotheses it might generate, based on its own internal scoring-thus defining a latent reward landscape over the hypothesis space; (2) whether such LLM-judged better hypotheses exhibit stronger alignment with ground-truth hypotheses; (3) whether shaping the reward landscape using an ensemble of diverse LLMs of similar capacity yields better outcomes than defining it with repeated instances of the strongest LLM among them; and (4) whether an ensemble of identical LLMs provides a more reliable reward landscape than a single LLM. To address these questions, we propose a hierarchical search method that incrementally proposes and integrates details into the hypothesis, progressing from general concepts to specific experimental configurations. We show that this hierarchical process smooths the reward landscape and enables more effective optimization. Empirical evaluations on a new benchmark of expert-annotated fine-grained hypotheses from recent chemistry literature show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines.</description>

      <title>When Ethics and Payoffs Diverge: LLM Agents in Morally Charged Social Dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their use in complex agentic roles, involving decision-making with humans or other agents, making ethical alignment a key AI safety concern. While prior work has examined both LLMs' moral judgment and strategic behavior in social dilemmas, there is limited understanding of how they act when moral imperatives directly conflict with rewards or incentives. To investigate this, we introduce Moral Behavior in Social Dilemma Simulation (MoralSim) and evaluate how LLMs behave in the prisoner's dilemma and public goods game with morally charged contexts. In MoralSim, we test a range of frontier models across both game structures and three distinct moral framings, enabling a systematic examination of how LLMs navigate social dilemmas in which ethical norms conflict with payoff-maximizing strategies. Our results show substantial variation across models in both their general tendency to act morally and the consistency of their behavior across game types, the specific moral framing, and situational factors such as opponent behavior and survival risks. Crucially, no model exhibits consistently moral behavior in MoralSim, highlighting the need for caution when deploying LLMs in agentic roles where the agent's "self-interest" may conflict with ethical expectations. Our code is available at https://github.com/sbackmann/moralsim.</description>

      <title>RAISE: Realness Assessment for Image Synthesis and Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly photorealistic visual content, offering practical substitutes for real images and videos in scenarios where acquiring real data is difficult or expensive. However, reliably substituting real visual content with AI-generated counterparts requires robust assessment of the perceived realness of AI-generated visual content, a challenging task due to its inherent subjective nature. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive human study evaluating the perceptual realness of both real and AI-generated images, resulting in a new dataset, containing images paired with subjective realness scores, introduced as RAISE in this paper. Further, we develop and train multiple models on RAISE to establish baselines for realness prediction. Our experimental results demonstrate that features derived from deep foundation vision models can effectively capture the subjective realness. RAISE thus provides a valuable resource for developing robust, objective models of perceptual realness assessment.</description>

      <title>Efficient Policy Optimization in Robust Constrained MDPs with Iteration Complexity Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constrained decision-making is essential for designing safe policies in real-world control systems, yet simulated environments often fail to capture real-world adversities. We consider the problem of learning a policy that will maximize the cumulative reward while satisfying a constraint, even when there is a mismatch between the real model and an accessible simulator/nominal model. In particular, we consider the robust constrained Markov decision problem (RCMDP) where an agent needs to maximize the reward and satisfy the constraint against the worst possible stochastic model under the uncertainty set centered around an unknown nominal model. Primal-dual methods, effective for standard constrained MDP (CMDP), are not applicable here because of the lack of the strong duality property. Further, one cannot apply the standard robust value-iteration based approach on the composite value function either as the worst case models may be different for the reward value function and the constraint value function. We propose a novel technique that effectively minimizes the constraint value function--to satisfy the constraints; on the other hand, when all the constraints are satisfied, it can simply maximize the robust reward value function. We prove that such an algorithm finds a policy with at most $\epsilon$ sub-optimality and feasible policy after $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. In contrast to the state-of-the-art method, we do not need to employ a binary search, thus, we reduce the computation time by at least 4x for smaller value of discount factor ($\gamma$) and by at least 6x for larger value of $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>LLLMs: A Data-Driven Survey of Evolving Research on Limitations of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) research has grown rapidly, along with increasing concern about their limitations such as failures in reasoning, hallucinations, and limited multilingual capability. In this survey, we conduct a data-driven, semi-automated review of research on limitations of LLM (LLLMs) from 2022 to 2024 using a bottom-up approach. From a corpus of 250,000 ACL and arXiv papers, we identify 14,648 relevant papers using keyword filtering, LLM-based classification, validated against expert labels, and topic clustering (via two approaches, HDBSCAN+BERTopic and LlooM). We find that LLM-related research increases over fivefold in ACL and fourfold in arXiv. Since 2022, LLLMs research grows even faster, reaching over 30% of LLM papers by late 2024. Reasoning remains the most studied limitation, followed by generalization, hallucination, bias, and security. The distribution of topics in the ACL dataset stays relatively stable over time, while arXiv shifts toward safety and controllability (with topics like security risks, alignment, hallucinations, knowledge editing), and multimodality between 2022 and 2024. We release a dataset of annotated abstracts and a validated methodology, and offer a quantitative view of trends in LLM limitations research.</description>

      <title>ActiveDPO: Active Direct Preference Optimization for Sample-Efficient Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent success of using human preferences to align large language models (LLMs) has significantly improved their performance in various downstream tasks like question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. However,3 achieving effective LLM alignment depends on high-quality human preference datasets. Collecting these datasets requires human preference annotation, which is costly and resource-intensive, necessitating efficient active data selection methods. Existing methods either lack a strong theoretical foundation or depend on restrictive reward function assumptions (e.g., linearity). To this end, we propose an algorithm, ActiveDPO, that uses a theoretically grounded data selection criterion for non-linear reward functions while directly leveraging the LLM itself to parameterize the reward model that is used for active data selection. As a result, ActiveDPO explicitly accounts for the influence of LLM on data selection, unlike methods that select the data without considering the LLM that is being aligned, thereby leading to more effective and efficient data collection. Extensive experiments show that ActiveDPO outperforms existing methods across various models and datasets.</description>

      <title>To CoT or To Loop? A Formal Comparison Between Chain-of-Thought and Looped Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Looped Transformers have been shown to empirically improve performance on reasoning tasks and to theoretically enhance expressivity by recursively increasing the number of computational steps. However, their comparative capabilities are still not well understood. In this paper, we provide a formal analysis of their respective strengths and limitations. We show that Looped Transformers can efficiently simulate parallel computations for deterministic tasks, which we formalize as evaluation over directed acyclic graphs. In contrast, CoT with stochastic decoding excels at approximate inference for compositional structures, namely self-reducible problems. These separations suggest the tasks for which depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical cues for choosing between reasoning paradigms.</description>

      <title>Improving Value Estimation Critically Enhances Vanilla Policy Gradient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern policy gradient algorithms, such as TRPO and PPO, outperform vanilla policy gradient in many RL tasks. Questioning the common belief that enforcing approximate trust regions leads to steady policy improvement in practice, we show that the more critical factor is the enhanced value estimation accuracy from more value update steps in each iteration. To demonstrate, we show that by simply increasing the number of value update steps per iteration, vanilla policy gradient itself can achieve performance comparable to or better than PPO in all the standard continuous control benchmark environments. Importantly, this simple change to vanilla policy gradient is significantly more robust to hyperparameter choices, opening up the possibility that RL algorithms may still become more effective and easier to use.</description>

      <title>Learning-Augmented Online Bipartite Fractional Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online bipartite matching is a fundamental problem in online optimization, extensively studied both in its integral and fractional forms due to its theoretical significance and practical applications, such as online advertising and resource allocation. Motivated by recent progress in learning-augmented algorithms, we study online bipartite fractional matching when the algorithm is given advice in the form of a suggested matching in each iteration. We develop algorithms for both the vertex-weighted and unweighted variants that provably dominate the naive "coin flip" strategy of randomly choosing between the advice-following and advice-free algorithms. Moreover, our algorithm for the vertex-weighted setting extends to the AdWords problem under the small bids assumption, yielding a significant improvement over the seminal work of Mahdian, Nazerzadeh, and Saberi (EC 2007, TALG 2012). Complementing our positive results, we establish a hardness bound on the robustness-consistency tradeoff that is attainable by any algorithm. We empirically validate our algorithms through experiments on synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <title>VTool-R1: VLMs Learn to Think with Images via Reinforcement Learning on Multimodal Tool Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Finetuning (RFT) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling long chains of thought, self-correction, and effective tool use. While recent works attempt to extend RFT to vision-language models (VLMs), these efforts largely produce text-only reasoning conditioned on static image inputs, falling short of true multimodal reasoning in the response. In contrast, test-time methods like Visual Sketchpad incorporate visual steps but lack training mechanisms.
  We introduce VTool-R1, the first framework that trains VLMs to generate multimodal chains of thought by interleaving text and intermediate visual reasoning steps. VTool-R1 integrates Python-based visual editing tools into the RFT process, enabling VLMs to learn when and how to generate visual reasoning steps that benefit final reasoning. Trained with outcome-based rewards tied to task accuracy, our approach elicits strategic visual tool use for reasoning without relying on process-based supervision. Experiments on structured visual question answering over charts and tables show that VTool-R1 enhances reasoning performance by teaching VLMs to "think with images" and generate multimodal chain of thoughts with tools.</description>

      <title>Towards Large Reasoning Models for Agriculture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agricultural decision-making involves complex, context-specific reasoning, where choices about crops, practices, and interventions depend heavily on geographic, climatic, and economic conditions. Traditional large language models (LLMs) often fall short in navigating this nuanced problem due to limited reasoning capacity. We hypothesize that recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) can better handle such structured, domain-specific inference. To investigate this, we introduce AgReason, the first expert-curated open-ended science benchmark with 100 questions for agricultural reasoning. Evaluations across thirteen open-source and proprietary models reveal that LRMs outperform conventional ones, though notable challenges persist, with the strongest Gemini-based baseline achieving 36% accuracy. We also present AgThoughts, a large-scale dataset of 44.6K question-answer pairs generated with human oversight and equipped with synthetically generated reasoning traces. Using AgThoughts, we develop AgThinker, a suite of small reasoning models that can be run on consumer-grade GPUs, and show that our dataset can be effective in unlocking agricultural reasoning abilities in LLMs. Our project page is here: https://baskargroup.github.io/Ag_reasoning/</description>

      <title>Enhancing Text-to-Image Diffusion Transformer via Split-Text Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion generation typically employs complete-text conditioning. Due to the intricate syntax, diffusion transformers (DiTs) inherently suffer from a comprehension defect of complete-text captions. One-fly complete-text input either overlooks critical semantic details or causes semantic confusion by simultaneously modeling diverse semantic primitive types. To mitigate this defect of DiTs, we propose a novel split-text conditioning framework named DiT-ST. This framework converts a complete-text caption into a split-text caption, a collection of simplified sentences, to explicitly express various semantic primitives and their interconnections. The split-text caption is then injected into different denoising stages of DiT-ST in a hierarchical and incremental manner. Specifically, DiT-ST leverages Large Language Models to parse captions, extracting diverse primitives and hierarchically sorting out and constructing these primitives into a split-text input. Moreover, we partition the diffusion denoising process according to its differential sensitivities to diverse semantic primitive types and determine the appropriate timesteps to incrementally inject tokens of diverse semantic primitive types into input tokens via cross-attention. In this way, DiT-ST enhances the representation learning of specific semantic primitive types across different stages. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed DiT-ST in mitigating the complete-text comprehension defect.</description>

      <title>Cellular Traffic Prediction via Byzantine-robust Asynchronous Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network traffic prediction plays a crucial role in intelligent network operation. Traditional prediction methods often rely on centralized training, necessitating the transfer of vast amounts of traffic data to a central server. This approach can lead to latency and privacy concerns. To address these issues, federated learning integrated with differential privacy has emerged as a solution to improve data privacy and model robustness in distributed settings. Nonetheless, existing federated learning protocols are vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, which may significantly compromise model robustness. Developing a robust and privacy-preserving prediction model in the presence of Byzantine clients remains a significant challenge. To this end, we propose an asynchronous differential federated learning framework based on distributionally robust optimization. The proposed framework utilizes multiple clients to train the prediction model collaboratively with local differential privacy. In addition, regularization techniques have been employed to further improve the Byzantine robustness of the models. We have conducted extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, and the results elucidate that our proposed distributed algorithm can achieve superior performance over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Eta-WavLM: Efficient Speaker Identity Removal in Self-Supervised Speech Representations Using a Simple Linear Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has reduced the reliance on expensive labeling in speech technologies by learning meaningful representations from unannotated data. Since most SSL-based downstream tasks prioritize content information in speech, ideal representations should disentangle content from unwanted variations like speaker characteristics in the SSL representations. However, removing speaker information often degrades other speech components, and existing methods either fail to fully disentangle speaker identity or require resource-intensive models. In this paper, we propose a novel disentanglement method that linearly decomposes SSL representations into speaker-specific and speaker-independent components, effectively generating speaker disentangled representations. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach achieves speaker independence and as such, when applied to content-driven tasks such as voice conversion, our representations yield significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-embedded image generation plays a critical role in industries such as graphic design, advertising, and digital content creation. Text-to-Image generation methods leveraging diffusion models, such as TextDiffuser-2, have demonstrated promising results in producing images with embedded text. TextDiffuser-2 effectively generates bounding box layouts that guide the rendering of visual text, achieving high fidelity and coherence. However, existing approaches often rely on resource-intensive processes and are limited in their ability to run efficiently on both CPU and GPU platforms. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) for rapid and optimized text layout generation with a diffusion-based image synthesis model. Our RL-based approach significantly accelerates the bounding box prediction step while reducing overlaps, allowing the system to run efficiently on both CPUs and GPUs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework maintains or surpasses TextDiffuser-2's quality in text placement and image synthesis, with markedly faster runtime and increased flexibility. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework maintains or surpasses TextDiffuser-2's quality in text placement and image synthesis, with markedly faster runtime and increased flexibility. Our approach has been evaluated on the MARIOEval benchmark, achieving OCR and CLIPScore metrics close to state-of-the-art models, while being 97.64% more faster and requiring only 2MB of memory to run.</description>

      <title>100-LongBench: Are de facto Long-Context Benchmarks Literally Evaluating Long-Context Ability?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-context capability is considered one of the most important abilities of LLMs, as a truly long context-capable LLM enables users to effortlessly process many originally exhausting tasks -- e.g., digesting a long-form document to find answers vs. directly asking an LLM about it. However, existing real-task-based long-context evaluation benchmarks have two major shortcomings. First, benchmarks like LongBench often do not provide proper metrics to separate long-context performance from the model's baseline ability, making cross-model comparison unclear. Second, such benchmarks are usually constructed with fixed input lengths, which limits their applicability across different models and fails to reveal when a model begins to break down. To address these issues, we introduce a length-controllable long-context benchmark and a novel metric that disentangles baseline knowledge from true long-context capabilities. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in effectively evaluating LLMs.</description>

      <title>A Necessary Step toward Faithfulness: Measuring and Improving Consistency in Free-Text Explanations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Faithful free-text explanations are important to ensure transparency in high-stakes AI decision-making contexts, but they are challenging to generate by language models and assess by humans. In this paper, we present a measure for Prediction-EXplanation (PEX) consistency, by extending the concept of weight of evidence. This measure quantifies how much a free-text explanation supports or opposes a prediction, serving as an important aspect of explanation faithfulness. Our analysis reveals that more than 62% explanations generated by large language models lack this consistency. We show that applying direct preference optimization improves the consistency of generated explanations across three model families, with improvement ranging from 43.1% to 292.3%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizing this consistency measure can improve explanation faithfulness by up to 9.7%.</description>

Abstract: Traditional Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems, primarily designed for human users or static machine identities via protocols such as OAuth, OpenID Connect (OIDC), and SAML, prove fundamentally inadequate for the dynamic, interdependent, and often ephemeral nature of AI agents operating at scale within Multi Agent Systems (MAS), a computational system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents that work collectively.
  This paper posits the imperative for a novel Agentic AI IAM framework: We deconstruct the limitations of existing protocols when applied to MAS, illustrating with concrete examples why their coarse-grained controls, single-entity focus, and lack of context-awareness falter. We then propose a comprehensive framework built upon rich, verifiable Agent Identities (IDs), leveraging Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), that encapsulate an agents capabilities, provenance, behavioral scope, and security posture.
  Our framework includes an Agent Naming Service (ANS) for secure and capability-aware discovery, dynamic fine-grained access control mechanisms, and critically, a unified global session management and policy enforcement layer for real-time control and consistent revocation across heterogeneous agent communication protocols. We also explore how Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) enable privacy-preserving attribute disclosure and verifiable policy compliance.
  We outline the architecture, operational lifecycle, innovative contributions, and security considerations of this new IAM paradigm, aiming to establish the foundational trust, accountability, and security necessary for the burgeoning field of agentic AI and the complex ecosystems they will inhabit.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Service Discovery: Chunking Strategies and Benchmarking</title>

Abstract: Integrating multiple (sub-)systems is essential to create advanced Information Systems. Difficulties mainly arise when integrating dynamic environments, e.g., the integration at design time of not yet existing services. This has been traditionally addressed using a registry that provides the API documentation of the endpoints. Large Language Models have shown to be capable of automatically creating system integrations (e.g., as service composition) based on this documentation but require concise input due to input oken limitations, especially regarding comprehensive API descriptions. Currently, it is unknown how best to preprocess these API descriptions. In the present work, we (i) analyze the usage of Retrieval Augmented Generation for endpoint discovery and the chunking, i.e., preprocessing, of state-of-practice OpenAPIs to reduce the input oken length while preserving the most relevant information. To further reduce the input token length for the composition prompt and improve endpoint retrieval, we propose (ii) a Discovery Agent that only receives a summary of the most relevant endpoints nd retrieves specification details on demand. We evaluate RAG for endpoint discovery using (iii) a proposed novel service discovery benchmark SOCBench-D representing a general setting across numerous domains and the real-world RestBench enchmark, first, for the different chunking possibilities and parameters measuring the endpoint retrieval accuracy. Then, we assess the Discovery Agent using the same test data set. The prototype shows how to successfully employ RAG for endpoint discovery to reduce the token count. Our experiments show that endpoint-based approaches outperform naive chunking methods for preprocessing. Relying on an agent significantly improves precision while being prone to decrease recall, disclosing the need for further reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>SoloSpeech: Enhancing Intelligibility and Quality in Target Speech Extraction through a Cascaded Generative Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Target Speech Extraction (TSE) aims to isolate a target speaker's voice from a mixture of multiple speakers by leveraging speaker-specific cues, typically provided as auxiliary audio (a.k.a. cue audio). Although recent advancements in TSE have primarily employed discriminative models that offer high perceptual quality, these models often introduce unwanted artifacts, reduce naturalness, and are sensitive to discrepancies between training and testing environments. On the other hand, generative models for TSE lag in perceptual quality and intelligibility. To address these challenges, we present SoloSpeech, a novel cascaded generative pipeline that integrates compression, extraction, reconstruction, and correction processes. SoloSpeech features a speaker-embedding-free target extractor that utilizes conditional information from the cue audio's latent space, aligning it with the mixture audio's latent space to prevent mismatches. Evaluated on the widely-used Libri2Mix dataset, SoloSpeech achieves the new state-of-the-art intelligibility and quality in target speech extraction and speech separation tasks while demonstrating exceptional generalization on out-of-domain data and real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Demand Selection for VRP with Emission Quota</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems are traditionally addressed using Operations Research (OR) methods, including metaheuristics. In this study, we introduce a demand selection problem for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with an emission quota, referred to as QVRP. The objective is to minimize the number of omitted deliveries while respecting the pollution quota. We focus on the demand selection part, called Maximum Feasible Vehicle Assignment (MFVA), while the construction of a routing for the VRP instance is solved using classical OR methods. We propose several methods for selecting the packages to omit, both from machine learning (ML) and OR. Our results show that, in this static problem setting, classical OR-based methods consistently outperform ML-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Prompting Decision Transformers for Zero-Shot Reach-Avoid Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning methods have shown promise for reach-avoid tasks, where an agent must reach a target state while avoiding undesirable regions of the state space. Existing approaches typically encode avoid-region information into an augmented state space and cost function, which prevents flexible, dynamic specification of novel avoid-region information at evaluation time. They also rely heavily on well-designed reward and cost functions, limiting scalability to complex or poorly structured environments. We introduce RADT, a decision transformer model for offline, reward-free, goal-conditioned, avoid region-conditioned RL. RADT encodes goals and avoid regions directly as prompt tokens, allowing any number of avoid regions of arbitrary size to be specified at evaluation time. Using only suboptimal offline trajectories from a random policy, RADT learns reach-avoid behavior through a novel combination of goal and avoid-region hindsight relabeling. We benchmark RADT against 3 existing offline goal-conditioned RL models across 11 tasks, environments, and experimental settings. RADT generalizes in a zero-shot manner to out-of-distribution avoid region sizes and counts, outperforming baselines that require retraining. In one such zero-shot setting, RADT achieves 35.7% improvement in normalized cost over the best retrained baseline while maintaining high goal-reaching success. We apply RADT to cell reprogramming in biology, where it reduces visits to undesirable intermediate gene expression states during trajectories to desired target states, despite stochastic transitions and discrete, structured state dynamics.</description>

      <title>Towards Humanoid Robot Autonomy: A Dynamic Architecture Integrating Continuous thought Machines (CTM) and Model Context Protocol (MCP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the gaps between the static pre-set "thinking-planning-action" of humanoid robots in unfamiliar scenarios and the highly programmed "call tool-return result" due to the lack of autonomous coding capabilities, this work designs a dynamic architecture connecting continuous thought machines (CTM) and model context protocol (MCP). It proposes a theoretical parallel solution through tick-slab and uses rank compression to achieve parameter suppression to provide a solution for achieving autonomous actions due to autonomous coding. The researcher used a simulation-based experiment using OpenAI's o4-mini-high as a tool to build the experimental environment, and introduced the extended SayCan dataset to conduct nine epochs of experiments. The experimental results show that the CTM-MCP architecture is feasible and effective through the data results of seven metrics: task success rate (TSR), execution success rate (ESR), average episode length (AEL), ROSCOE, REVEAL, proficiency self-assessment (PSA), task effectiveness (TE). In practice, it provides a reference experience for exploring the autonomous dynamic coding of humanoid robots based on continuous thinking to achieve human-like autonomous actions.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Multi-Device Inference Acceleration for Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer models power many AI applications but suffer from high inference latency, limiting their use in real-time settings. Multi-device inference can reduce latency by parallelizing computation. Yet, existing methods require high inter-device bandwidth, making them impractical for bandwidth-constrained environments. We propose ASTRA, a communication-efficient framework that accelerates Transformer inference through a novel integration of sequence parallelism and a Mixed-Precision Attention mechanism designed to minimize inter-device communication. ASTRA compresses non-local token embeddings via vector quantization and preserves task accuracy through two optimizations, Noise-Augmented Quantization and Distributed Class Tokens. Experiments on ViT and GPT2 across vision and NLP tasks show that ASTRA achieves up to 2.64X speedups over single-device inference and up to 15.25X speedups over state-of-the-art multi-device inferences, while operating under bandwidths as low as 10 Mbps. ASTRA is open-sourced at https://github.com/xl1990/Astra.</description>

      <title>PatentScore: Multi-dimensional Evaluation of LLM-Generated Patent Claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural language generation (NLG) metrics play a central role in evaluating generated texts, but are not well suited for the structural and legal characteristics of patent documents. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong potential in automating patent generation, yet research on evaluating LLM-generated patents remains limited, especially in evaluating the generation quality of patent claims, which are central to defining the scope of protection. Effective claim evaluation requires addressing legal validity, technical accuracy, and structural compliance. To address this gap, we introduce PatentScore, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing LLM-generated patent claims. PatentScore incorporates: (1) hierarchical decomposition for claim analysis; (2) domain-specific validation patterns based on legal and technical standards; and (3) scoring across structural, semantic, and legal dimensions. Unlike general-purpose NLG metrics, PatentScore reflects patent-specific constraints and document structures, enabling evaluation beyond surface similarity. We evaluate 400 GPT-4o-mini generated Claim 1s and report a Pearson correlation of $r = 0.819$ with expert annotations, outperforming existing NLG metrics. Furthermore, we conduct additional evaluations using open models such as Claude-3.5-Haiku and Gemini-1.5-flash, all of which show strong correlations with expert judgments, confirming the robustness and generalizability of our framework.</description>

      <title>Optimized Text Embedding Models and Benchmarks for Amharic Passage Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural retrieval methods using transformer-based pre-trained language models have advanced multilingual and cross-lingual retrieval. However, their effectiveness for low-resource, morphologically rich languages such as Amharic remains underexplored due to data scarcity and suboptimal tokenization. We address this gap by introducing Amharic-specific dense retrieval models based on pre-trained Amharic BERT and RoBERTa backbones. Our proposed RoBERTa-Base-Amharic-Embed model (110M parameters) achieves a 17.6% relative improvement in MRR@10 and a 9.86% gain in Recall@10 over the strongest multilingual baseline, Arctic Embed 2.0 (568M parameters). More compact variants, such as RoBERTa-Medium-Amharic-Embed (42M), remain competitive while being over 13x smaller. Additionally, we train a ColBERT-based late interaction retrieval model that achieves the highest MRR@10 score (0.843) among all evaluated models. We benchmark our proposed models against both sparse and dense retrieval baselines to systematically assess retrieval effectiveness in Amharic. Our analysis highlights key challenges in low-resource settings and underscores the importance of language-specific adaptation. To foster future research in low-resource IR, we publicly release our dataset, codebase, and trained models at https://github.com/kidist-amde/amharic-ir-benchmarks.</description>

      <title>SETransformer: A Hybrid Attention-Based Architecture for Robust Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable sensor data has become a central task in mobile computing, healthcare, and human-computer interaction. Despite the success of traditional deep learning models such as CNNs and RNNs, they often struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies and contextual relevance across multiple sensor channels. To address these limitations, we propose SETransformer, a hybrid deep neural architecture that combines Transformer-based temporal modeling with channel-wise squeeze-and-excitation (SE) attention and a learnable temporal attention pooling mechanism. The model takes raw triaxial accelerometer data as input and leverages global self-attention to capture activity-specific motion dynamics over extended time windows, while adaptively emphasizing informative sensor channels and critical time steps.
  We evaluate SETransformer on the WISDM dataset and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms conventional models including LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, and CNN baselines. The proposed model achieves a validation accuracy of 84.68\% and a macro F1-score of 84.64\%, surpassing all baseline architectures by a notable margin. Our results show that SETransformer is a competitive and interpretable solution for real-world HAR tasks, with strong potential for deployment in mobile and ubiquitous sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Advancing Limited-Angle CT Reconstruction Through Diffusion-Based Sinogram Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limited Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) often faces significant challenges due to missing angular information. Unlike previous methods that operate in the image domain, we propose a new method that focuses on sinogram inpainting. We leverage MR-SDEs, a variant of diffusion models that characterize the diffusion process with mean-reverting stochastic differential equations, to fill in missing angular data at the projection level. Furthermore, by combining distillation with constraining the output of the model using the pseudo-inverse of the inpainting matrix, the diffusion process is accelerated and done in a step, enabling efficient and accurate sinogram completion. A subsequent post-processing module back-projects the inpainted sinogram into the image domain and further refines the reconstruction, effectively suppressing artifacts while preserving critical structural details. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both perceptual and fidelity quality, offering a promising solution for LACT reconstruction in scientific and clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Force Prompting: Video Generation Models Can Learn and Generalize Physics-based Control Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in video generation models have sparked interest in world models capable of simulating realistic environments. While navigation has been well-explored, physically meaningful interactions that mimic real-world forces remain largely understudied. In this work, we investigate using physical forces as a control signal for video generation and propose force prompts which enable users to interact with images through both localized point forces, such as poking a plant, and global wind force fields, such as wind blowing on fabric. We demonstrate that these force prompts can enable videos to respond realistically to physical control signals by leveraging the visual and motion prior in the original pretrained model, without using any 3D asset or physics simulator at inference. The primary challenge of force prompting is the difficulty in obtaining high quality paired force-video training data, both in the real world due to the difficulty of obtaining force signals, and in synthetic data due to limitations in the visual quality and domain diversity of physics simulators. Our key finding is that video generation models can generalize remarkably well when adapted to follow physical force conditioning from videos synthesized by Blender, even with limited demonstrations of few objects. Our method can generate videos which simulate forces across diverse geometries, settings, and materials. We also try to understand the source of this generalization and perform ablations that reveal two key elements: visual diversity and the use of specific text keywords during training. Our approach is trained on only around 15k training examples for a single day on four A100 GPUs, and outperforms existing methods on force adherence and physics realism, bringing world models closer to real-world physics interactions. We release all datasets, code, weights, and interactive video demos at our project page.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code documentation is useful, but writing it is time-consuming. Different techniques for generating code summaries have emerged, but comparing them is difficult because human evaluation is expensive and automatic metrics are unreliable. In this paper, we introduce a simple new baseline in which we ask an LLM to give an overall score to a summary. Unlike n-gram and embedding-based baselines, our approach is able to consider the code when giving a score. This allows us to also make a variant that does not consider the reference summary at all, which could be used for other tasks, e.g., to evaluate the quality of documentation in code bases. We find that our method is as good or better than prior metrics, though we recommend using it in conjunction with embedding-based methods to avoid the risk of LLM-specific bias.</description>

      <title>VADER: A Human-Evaluated Benchmark for Vulnerability Assessment, Detection, Explanation, and Remediation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) can effectively assess, detect, explain, and remediate software vulnerabilities is critical for building robust and secure software systems. We introduce VADER, a human-evaluated benchmark designed explicitly to assess LLM performance across four key vulnerability-handling dimensions: assessment, detection, explanation, and remediation. VADER comprises 174 real-world software vulnerabilities, each carefully curated from GitHub repositories and annotated by security experts. For each vulnerability case, models are tasked with identifying the flaw, classifying it using Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), explaining its underlying cause, proposing a patch, and formulating a test plan. Using a one-shot prompting strategy, we benchmark six state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.5, Grok 3 Beta, and o3) on VADER, and human security experts evaluated each response according to a rigorous scoring rubric emphasizing remediation (quality of the code fix, 50%), explanation (20%), and classification and test plan (30%) according to a standardized rubric. Our results show that current state-of-the-art LLMs achieve only moderate success on VADER - OpenAI's o3 attained 54.7% accuracy overall, with others in the 49-54% range, indicating ample room for improvement. Notably, remediation quality is strongly correlated (Pearson r &gt; 0.97) with accurate classification and test plans, suggesting that models that effectively categorize vulnerabilities also tend to fix them well. VADER's comprehensive dataset, detailed evaluation rubrics, scoring tools, and visualized results with confidence intervals are publicly released, providing the community with an interpretable, reproducible benchmark to advance vulnerability-aware LLMs. All code and data are available at: https://github.com/AfterQuery/vader</description>

      <title>Exploring the Possibility of TypiClust for Low-Budget Federated Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Active Learning (FAL) seeks to reduce the burden of annotation under the realistic constraints of federated learning by leveraging Active Learning (AL). As FAL settings make it more expensive to obtain ground truth labels, FAL strategies that work well in low-budget regimes, where the amount of annotation is very limited, are needed. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of TypiClust, a successful low-budget AL strategy, in low-budget FAL settings. Our empirical results show that TypiClust works well even in low-budget FAL settings contrasted with relatively low performances of other methods, although these settings present additional challenges, such as data heterogeneity, compared to AL. In addition, we show that FAL settings cause distribution shifts in terms of typicality, but TypiClust is not very vulnerable to the shifts. We also analyze the sensitivity of TypiClust to feature extraction methods, and it suggests a way to perform FAL even in limited data situations.</description>

      <title>It's Not Just Labeling" -- A Research on LLM Generated Feedback Interpretability and Image Labeling Sketch Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quality of training data is critical to the performance of machine learning applications in domains like transportation, healthcare, and robotics. Accurate image labeling, however, often relies on time-consuming, expert-driven methods with limited feedback. This research introduces a sketch-based annotation approach supported by large language models (LLMs) to reduce technical barriers and enhance accessibility. Using a synthetic dataset, we examine how sketch recognition features relate to LLM feedback metrics, aiming to improve the reliability and interpretability of LLM-assisted labeling. We also explore how prompting strategies and sketch variations influence feedback quality. Our main contribution is a sketch-based virtual assistant that simplifies annotation for non-experts and advances LLM-driven labeling tools in terms of scalability, accessibility, and explainability.</description>

      <title>Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning Based on Autoencoder and Hyperbolic Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (ERL), training the Reinforcement Learning (RL) policies with Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), have demonstrated enhanced exploration capabilities and greater robustness than using traditional policy gradient. However, ERL suffers from the high computational costs and low search efficiency, as EAs require evaluating numerous candidate policies with expensive simulations, many of which are ineffective and do not contribute meaningfully to the training. One intuitive way to reduce the ineffective evaluations is to adopt the surrogates. Unfortunately, existing ERL policies are often modeled as deep neural networks (DNNs) and thus naturally represented as high-dimensional vectors containing millions of weights, which makes the building of effective surrogates for ERL policies extremely challenging. This paper proposes a novel surrogate-assisted ERL that integrates Autoencoders (AE) and Hyperbolic Neural Networks (HNN). Specifically, AE compresses high-dimensional policies into low-dimensional representations while extracting key features as the inputs for the surrogate. HNN, functioning as a classification-based surrogate model, can learn complex nonlinear relationships from sampled data and enable more accurate pre-selection of the sampled policies without real evaluations. The experiments on 10 Atari and 4 Mujoco games have verified that the proposed method outperforms previous approaches significantly. The search trajectories guided by AE and HNN are also visually demonstrated to be more effective, in terms of both exploration and convergence. This paper not only presents the first learnable policy embedding and surrogate-modeling modules for high-dimensional ERL policies, but also empirically reveals when and why they can be successful.</description>

      <title>The Role of Diversity in In-Context Learning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a crucial capability of current large language models (LLMs), where the selection of examples plays a key role in performance. While most existing approaches focus on selecting the most similar examples to the query, the impact of diversity in example selection remains underexplored. We systematically investigate the role of diversity in in-context example selection through experiments across a range of tasks, from sentiment classification to more challenging math and code problems. Experiments on Llama-3.1, Gemma-2, and Mistral-v0.3 families of models show that diversity-aware selection methods improve performance, particularly on complex tasks like math and code, and enhance robustness to out-of-distribution queries. To support these findings, we introduce a theoretical framework that explains the benefits of incorporating diversity in in-context example selection.</description>

      <title>WINA: Weight Informed Neuron Activation for Accelerating Large Language Model Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing computational demands of large language models (LLMs) make efficient inference and activation strategies increasingly critical. While recent approaches, such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), leverage selective activation but require specialized training, training-free sparse activation methods offer broader applicability and superior resource efficiency through their plug-and-play design. However, many existing methods rely solely on hidden state magnitudes to determine activation, resulting in high approximation errors and suboptimal inference accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose WINA (Weight Informed Neuron Activation), a novel, simple, and training-free sparse activation framework that jointly considers hidden state magnitudes and the column-wise $\ell_2$-norms of weight matrices. We show that this leads to a sparsification strategy that obtains optimal approximation error bounds with theoretical guarantees tighter than existing techniques. Empirically, WINA also outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., TEAL) by up to $2.94\%$ in average performance at the same sparsity levels, across a diverse set of LLM architectures and datasets. These results position WINA as a new performance frontier for training-free sparse activation in LLM inference, advancing training-free sparse activation methods and setting a robust baseline for efficient inference.

      <title>Deriving Strategic Market Insights with Large Language Models: A Benchmark for Forward Counterfactual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning typically involves considering alternatives to actual events. While often applied to understand past events, a distinct form-forward counterfactual reasoning-focuses on anticipating plausible future developments. This type of reasoning is invaluable in dynamic financial markets, where anticipating market developments can powerfully unveil potential risks and opportunities for stakeholders, guiding their decision-making. However, performing this at scale is challenging due to the cognitive demands involved, underscoring the need for automated solutions. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise, but remain unexplored for this application. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark, Fin-Force-FINancial FORward Counterfactual Evaluation. By curating financial news headlines and providing structured evaluation, Fin-Force supports LLM based forward counterfactual generation. This paves the way for scalable and automated solutions for exploring and anticipating future market developments, thereby providing structured insights for decision-making. Through experiments on Fin-Force, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and counterfactual generation methods, analyzing their limitations and proposing insights for future research.</description>

      <title>CSTrack: Enhancing RGB-X Tracking via Compact Spatiotemporal Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effectively modeling and utilizing spatiotemporal features from RGB and other modalities (\eg, depth, thermal, and event data, denoted as X) is the core of RGB-X tracker design. Existing methods often employ two parallel branches to separately process the RGB and X input streams, requiring the model to simultaneously handle two dispersed feature spaces, which complicates both the model structure and computation process. More critically, intra-modality spatial modeling within each dispersed space incurs substantial computational overhead, limiting resources for inter-modality spatial modeling and temporal modeling. To address this, we propose a novel tracker, CSTrack, which focuses on modeling Compact Spatiotemporal features to achieve simple yet effective tracking. Specifically, we first introduce an innovative Spatial Compact Module that integrates the RGB-X dual input streams into a compact spatial feature, enabling thorough intra- and inter-modality spatial modeling. Additionally, we design an efficient Temporal Compact Module that compactly represents temporal features by constructing the refined target distribution heatmap. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our compact spatiotemporal modeling method, with CSTrack achieving new SOTA results on mainstream RGB-X benchmarks. The code and models will be released at: https://github.com/XiaokunFeng/CSTrack.</description>

      <title>Fairness Practices in Industry: A Case Study in Machine Learning Teams Building Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recommender systems necessitates robust fairness practices to address inherent biases. Assessing fairness, though, is challenging due to constantly evolving metrics and best practices. This paper analyzes how industry practitioners perceive and incorporate these changing fairness standards in their workflows. Through semi-structured interviews with 11 practitioners from technical teams across a range of large technology companies, we investigate industry implementations of fairness in recommendation system products. We focus on current debiasing practices, applied metrics, collaborative strategies, and integrating academic research into practice. Findings show a preference for multi-dimensional debiasing over traditional demographic methods, and a reliance on intuitive rather than academic metrics. This study also highlights the difficulties in balancing fairness with both the practitioner's individual (bottom-up) roles and organizational (top-down) workplace constraints, including the interplay with legal and compliance experts. Finally, we offer actionable recommendations for the recommender system community and algorithmic fairness practitioners, underlining the need to refine fairness practices continually.</description>

      <title>Vibe Coding vs. Agentic Coding: Fundamentals and Practical Implications of Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review presents a comprehensive analysis of two emerging paradigms in AI-assisted software development: vibe coding and agentic coding. While both leverage large language models (LLMs), they differ fundamentally in autonomy, architectural design, and the role of the developer. Vibe coding emphasizes intuitive, human-in-the-loop interaction through prompt-based, conversational workflows that support ideation, experimentation, and creative exploration. In contrast, agentic coding enables autonomous software development through goal-driven agents capable of planning, executing, testing, and iterating tasks with minimal human intervention. We propose a detailed taxonomy spanning conceptual foundations, execution models, feedback loops, safety mechanisms, debugging strategies, and real-world tool ecosystems. Through comparative workflow analysis and 20 detailed use cases, we illustrate how vibe systems thrive in early-stage prototyping and education, while agentic systems excel in enterprise-grade automation, codebase refactoring, and CI/CD integration. We further examine emerging trends in hybrid architectures, where natural language interfaces are coupled with autonomous execution pipelines. Finally, we articulate a future roadmap for agentic AI, outlining the infrastructure needed for trustworthy, explainable, and collaborative systems. Our findings suggest that successful AI software engineering will rely not on choosing one paradigm, but on harmonizing their strengths within a unified, human-centered development lifecycle.</description>

      <title>MM-Prompt: Cross-Modal Prompt Tuning for Continual Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual Visual Question Answering (CVQA) based on pre-trained models(PTMs) has achieved promising progress by leveraging prompt tuning to enable continual multi-modal learning. However, most existing methods adopt cross-modal prompt isolation, constructing visual and textual prompts separately, which exacerbates modality imbalance and leads to degraded performance over time. To tackle this issue, we propose MM-Prompt, a novel framework incorporating cross-modal prompt query and cross-modal prompt recovery. The former enables balanced prompt selection by incorporating cross-modal signals during query formation, while the latter promotes joint prompt reconstruction through iterative cross-modal interactions, guided by an alignment loss to prevent representational drift. Extensive experiments show that MM-Prompt surpasses prior approaches in accuracy and knowledge retention, while maintaining balanced modality engagement throughout continual learning.</description>

      <title>Your Classifier Can Do More: Towards Bridging the Gaps in Classification, Robustness, and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint Energy-based Models (JEMs), a class of hybrid generative-discriminative models, are well known for their ability to achieve both high classification accuracy and generative capability within a single model. However, their robustness still lags significantly behind the classifiers based adversarial training (AT). Conversely, while AT is currently the most effective approach to improving the classifier's robustness, it typically sacrifices accuracy on clean data and lacks generative capability. The triple trade-off between classification accuracy, generative capability and robustness, raises a natural question: Can a single model simultaneously achieve high classification accuracy, adversarial robustness, and generative performance? -- a goal that has been rarely explored. To address this question, we systematically analyze the energy distribution differences of clean, adversarial, and generated samples across various JEM variants and adversarially trained models. We observe that AT tends to reduce the energy gap between clean and adversarial samples, while JEMs reduce the gap between clean and synthetic ones. This observation suggests a key insight: if the energy distributions of all three data types can be aligned, we might unify the strengths of AT and JEMs, resolving their inherent trade-offs. Building on this idea, we propose Energy-based Joint Distribution Adversarial Training (EB-JDAT), to jointly model the clean data distribution, the adversarial distribution, and the classifier by maximizing their joint probability. EB-JDAT is a general and flexible optimization method, compatible with various JEM variants. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that EB-JDAT not only maintains near original accuracy and generative capability of JEMs, but also significantly enhances robustness, even surpassing state-of-the-art ATs.</description>

      <title>Residual Cross-Attention Transformer-Based Multi-User CSI Feedback with Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes a deep-learning (DL)-based multi-user channel state information (CSI) feedback framework for massive multiple-input multiple-output systems, where the deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) is utilized to improve the CSI reconstruction accuracy. Specifically, we design a multi-user joint CSI feedback framework, whereby the CSI correlation of nearby users is utilized to reduce the feedback overhead. Under the framework, we propose a new residual cross-attention transformer architecture, which is deployed at the base station to further improve the CSI feedback performance. Moreover, to tackle the "cliff-effect" of conventional bit-level CSI feedback approaches, we integrated DJSCC into the multi-user CSI feedback, together with utilizing a two-stage training scheme to adapt to varying uplink noise levels. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods in CSI feedback performance, with low network complexity and better scalability.</description>

      <title>Diversity-Driven Generative Dataset Distillation Based on Diffusion Model with Self-Adaptive Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dataset distillation enables the training of deep neural networks with comparable performance in significantly reduced time by compressing large datasets into small and representative ones. Although the introduction of generative models has made great achievements in this field, the distributions of their distilled datasets are not diverse enough to represent the original ones, leading to a decrease in downstream validation accuracy. In this paper, we present a diversity-driven generative dataset distillation method based on a diffusion model to solve this problem. We introduce self-adaptive memory to align the distribution between distilled and real datasets, assessing the representativeness. The degree of alignment leads the diffusion model to generate more diverse datasets during the distillation process. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in most situations, proving its ability to tackle dataset distillation tasks.</description>

      <title>Win Fast or Lose Slow: Balancing Speed and Accuracy in Latency-Sensitive Decisions of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across diverse reasoning and generation tasks, and are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic environments such as code generation and recommendation systems. However, many real-world applications, such as high-frequency trading and real-time competitive gaming, require decisions under strict latency constraints, where faster responses directly translate into higher rewards. Despite the importance of this latency quality trade off, it remains underexplored in the context of LLM based agents. In this work, we present the first systematic study of this trade off in real time decision making tasks. To support our investigation, we introduce two new benchmarks: HFTBench, a high frequency trading simulation, and StreetFighter, a competitive gaming platform. Our analysis reveals that optimal latency quality balance varies by task, and that sacrificing quality for lower latency can significantly enhance downstream performance. To address this, we propose FPX, an adaptive framework that dynamically selects model size and quantization level based on real time demands. Our method achieves the best performance on both benchmarks, improving win rate by up to 80% in Street Fighter and boosting daily yield by up to 26.52% in trading, underscoring the need for latency aware evaluation and deployment strategies for LLM based agents. These results demonstrate the critical importance of latency aware evaluation and deployment strategies for real world LLM based agents. Our benchmarks are available at Latency Sensitive Benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we share our reflections and insights on understanding Transformer architectures through the lens of associative memory--a classic psychological concept inspired by human cognition. We start with the basics of associative memory (think simple linear attention) and then dive into two dimensions:
  Memory Capacity: How much can a Transformer really remember, and how well? We introduce retrieval SNR to measure this and use a kernel perspective to mathematically reveal why Softmax Attention is so effective. We also show how FFNs can be seen as a type of associative memory, leading to insights on their design and potential improvements.
  Memory Update: How do these memories learn and evolve? We present a unified framework for understanding how different Transformer variants (like DeltaNet and Softmax Attention) update their "knowledge base". This leads us to tackle two provocative questions: 1. Are Transformers fundamentally limited in what they can express, and can we break these barriers? 2. If a Transformer had infinite context, would it become infinitely intelligent?
  We want to demystify Transformer architecture, offering a clearer understanding of existing designs. This exploration aims to provide fresh insights and spark new avenues for Transformer innovation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Visual Reliance in Text Generation: A Bayesian Perspective on Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually generate texts which satisfy context coherence but don't match the visual input. Such a hallucination issue hinders LVLMs' applicability in the real world. The key to solving hallucination in LVLM is to make the text generation rely more on the visual content. Most previous works choose to enhance/adjust the features/output of a specific modality (i.e., visual or textual) to alleviate hallucinations in LVLM, which do not explicitly or systematically enhance the visual reliance. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the factors which may degenerate the visual reliance in text generation of LVLM from a Bayesian perspective. Based on our observations, we propose to mitigate hallucination in LVLM from three aspects. Firstly, we observe that not all visual tokens are informative in generating meaningful texts. We propose to evaluate and remove redundant visual tokens to avoid their disturbance. Secondly, LVLM may encode inappropriate prior information, making it lean toward generating unexpected words. We propose a simple yet effective way to rectify the prior from a Bayesian perspective. Thirdly, we observe that starting from certain steps, the posterior of next-token prediction conditioned on visual tokens may collapse to a prior distribution which does not depend on any informative visual tokens at all. Thus, we propose to stop further text generation to avoid hallucination. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks including POPE, CHAIR, and MME demonstrate that our method can consistently mitigate the hallucination issue of LVLM and performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts.</description>

      <title>CODE-DITING: A Reasoning-Based Metric for Functional Alignment in Code Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trustworthy evaluation methods for code snippets play a crucial role in neural code generation. Traditional methods, which either rely on reference solutions or require executable test cases, have inherent limitation in flexibility and scalability. The recent LLM-as-Judge methodology offers a promising alternative by directly evaluating functional consistency between the problem description and the generated code. To systematically understand the landscape of these LLM-as-Judge methods, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study across three diverse datasets. Our investigation reveals the pros and cons of two categories of LLM-as-Judge methods: the methods based on general foundation models can achieve good performance but require complex prompts and lack explainability, while the methods based on reasoning foundation models provide better explainability with simpler prompts but demand substantial computational resources due to their large parameter sizes. To address these limitations, we propose CODE-DITING, a novel code evaluation method that balances accuracy, efficiency and explainability. We develop a data distillation framework that effectively transfers reasoning capabilities from DeepSeek-R1671B to our CODE-DITING 1.5B and 7B models, significantly enhancing evaluation explainability and reducing the computational cost. With the majority vote strategy in the inference process, CODE-DITING 1.5B outperforms all models with the same magnitude of parameters and achieves performance which would normally exhibit in a model with 5 times of parameter scale. CODE-DITING 7B surpasses GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 671B, even though it only uses 1% of the parameter volume of these large models. Further experiments show that CODEDITING is robust to preference leakage and can serve as a promising alternative for code evaluation.</description>

      <title>DOGe: Defensive Output Generation for LLM Protection Against Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent substantial intellectual and economic investments, yet their effectiveness can inadvertently facilitate model imitation via knowledge distillation (KD).In practical scenarios, competitors can distill proprietary LLM capabilities by simply observing publicly accessible outputs, akin to reverse-engineering a complex performance by observation alone. Existing protective methods like watermarking only identify imitation post-hoc, while other defenses assume the student model mimics the teacher's internal logits, rendering them ineffective against distillation purely from observed output text. This paper confronts the challenge of actively protecting LLMs within the realistic constraints of API-based access. We introduce an effective and efficient Defensive Output Generation (DOGe) strategy that subtly modifies the output behavior of an LLM. Its outputs remain accurate and useful for legitimate users, yet are designed to be misleading for distillation, significantly undermining imitation attempts. We achieve this by fine-tuning only the final linear layer of the teacher LLM with an adversarial loss. This targeted training approach anticipates and disrupts distillation attempts during inference time. Our experiments show that, while preserving or even improving the original performance of the teacher model, student models distilled from the defensively generated teacher outputs demonstrate catastrophically reduced performance, demonstrating our method's effectiveness as a practical safeguard against KD-based model imitation.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Tree Search-based User Lifelong Behavior Modeling on Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in Recommendation Systems (RS) due to their extensive world knowledge and robust reasoning capabilities. However, a critical challenge lies in enabling LLMs to effectively comprehend and extract insights from massive user behaviors. Current approaches that directly leverage LLMs for user interest learning face limitations in handling long sequential behaviors, effectively extracting interest, and applying interest in practical scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Hierarchical Tree Search-based User Lifelong Behavior Modeling framework (HiT-LBM). HiT-LBM integrates Chunked User Behavior Extraction (CUBE) and Hierarchical Tree Search for Interest (HTS) to capture diverse interests and interest evolution of user. CUBE divides user lifelong behaviors into multiple chunks and learns the interest and interest evolution within each chunk in a cascading manner. HTS generates candidate interests through hierarchical expansion and searches for the optimal interest with process rating model to ensure information gain for each behavior chunk. Additionally, we design Temporal-Ware Interest Fusion (TIF) to integrate interests from multiple behavior chunks, constructing a comprehensive representation of user lifelong interests. The representation can be embedded into any recommendation model to enhance performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it surpasses state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Multimodal Knowledge Conflict for Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models(LMMs) face notable challenges when encountering multimodal knowledge conflicts, particularly under retrieval-augmented generation(RAG) frameworks where the contextual information from external sources may contradict the model's internal parametric knowledge, leading to unreliable outputs. However, existing benchmarks fail to reflect such realistic conflict scenarios. Most focus solely on intra-memory conflicts, while context-memory and inter-context conflicts remain largely investigated. Furthermore, commonly used factual knowledge-based evaluations are often overlooked, and existing datasets lack a thorough investigation into conflict detection capabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose MMKC-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate factual knowledge conflicts in both context-memory and inter-context scenarios. MMKC-Bench encompasses three types of multimodal knowledge conflicts and includes 1,573 knowledge instances and 3,381 images across 23 broad types, collected through automated pipelines with human verification. We evaluate three representative series of LMMs on both model behavior analysis and conflict detection tasks. Our findings show that while current LMMs are capable of recognizing knowledge conflicts, they tend to favor internal parametric knowledge over external evidence. We hope MMKC-Bench will foster further research in multimodal knowledge conflict and enhance the development of multimodal RAG systems.

      <title>SIPDO: Closed-Loop Prompt Optimization via Synthetic Data Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of large language models (LLMs), motivating a growing body of work on prompt optimization. Most existing methods optimize prompts over a fixed dataset, assuming static input distributions and offering limited support for iterative improvement. We introduce SIPDO (Self-Improving Prompts through Data-Augmented Optimization), a closed-loop framework for prompt learning that integrates synthetic data generation into the optimization process. SIPDO couples a synthetic data generator with a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that reveal current prompt weaknesses and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. This feedback-driven loop enables systematic improvement of prompt performance without assuming access to external supervision or new tasks. Experiments across question answering and reasoning benchmarks show that SIPDO outperforms standard prompt tuning methods, highlighting the value of integrating data synthesis into prompt learning workflows.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Gating Mechanism in Sparse MoE: Handling Arbitrary Modality Inputs with Confidence-Guided Gate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effectively managing missing modalities is a fundamental challenge in real-world multimodal learning scenarios, where data incompleteness often results from systematic collection errors or sensor failures. Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures have the potential to naturally handle multimodal data, with individual experts specializing in different modalities. However, existing SMoE approach often lacks proper ability to handle missing modality, leading to performance degradation and poor generalization in real-world applications. We propose Conf-SMoE to introduce a two-stage imputation module to handle the missing modality problem for the SMoE architecture and reveal the insight of expert collapse from theoretical analysis with strong empirical evidence. Inspired by our theoretical analysis, Conf-SMoE propose a novel expert gating mechanism by detaching the softmax routing score to task confidence score w.r.t ground truth. This naturally relieves expert collapse without introducing additional load balance loss function. We show that the insights of expert collapse aligns with other gating mechanism such as Gaussian and Laplacian gate. We also evaluate the proposed method on four different real world dataset with three different experiment settings to conduct comprehensive the analysis of Conf-SMoE on modality fusion and resistance to missing modality.</description>

      <title>Navigating loss manifolds via rigid body dynamics: A promising avenue for robustness and generalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training large neural networks through gradient-based optimization requires navigating high-dimensional loss landscapes, which often exhibit pathological geometry, leading to undesirable training dynamics. In particular, poor generalization frequently results from convergence to sharp minima that are highly sensitive to input perturbations, causing the model to overfit the training data while failing to generalize to unseen examples. Furthermore, these optimization procedures typically display strong dependence on the fine structure of the loss landscape, leading to unstable training dynamics, due to the fractal-like nature of the loss surface. In this work, we propose an alternative optimizer that simultaneously reduces this dependence, and avoids sharp minima, thereby improving generalization. This is achieved by simulating the motion of the center of a ball rolling on the loss landscape. The degree to which our optimizer departs from the standard gradient descent is controlled by a hyperparameter, representing the radius of the ball. Changing this hyperparameter allows for probing the loss landscape at different scales, making it a valuable tool for understanding its geometry.</description>

      <title>AmpleHate: Amplifying the Attention for Versatile Implicit Hate Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit hate speech detection is challenging due to its subtlety and reliance on contextual interpretation rather than explicit offensive words. Current approaches rely on contrastive learning, which are shown to be effective on distinguishing hate and non-hate sentences. Humans, however, detect implicit hate speech by first identifying specific targets within the text and subsequently interpreting how these target relate to their surrounding context. Motivated by this reasoning process, we propose AmpleHate, a novel approach designed to mirror human inference for implicit hate detection. AmpleHate identifies explicit target using a pretrained Named Entity Recognition model and capture implicit target information via [CLS] tokens. It computes attention-based relationships between explicit, implicit targets and sentence context and then, directly injects these relational vectors into the final sentence representation. This amplifies the critical signals of target-context relations for determining implicit hate. Experiments demonstrate that AmpleHate achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming contrastive learning baselines by an average of 82.14% and achieve faster convergence. Qualitative analyses further reveal that attention patterns produced by AmpleHate closely align with human judgement, underscoring its interpretability and robustness.</description>

      <title>Minimalist Softmax Attention Provably Learns Constrained Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the computational limits of learning $k$-bit Boolean functions (specifically, $\mathrm{AND}$, $\mathrm{OR}$, and their noisy variants), using a minimalist single-head softmax-attention mechanism, where $k=\Theta(d)$ relevant bits are selected from $d$ inputs. We show that these simple $\mathrm{AND}$ and $\mathrm{OR}$ functions are unsolvable with a single-head softmax-attention mechanism alone. However, with teacher forcing, the same minimalist attention is capable of solving them. These findings offer two key insights: Architecturally, solving these Boolean tasks requires only minimalist attention, without deep Transformer blocks or FFNs. Methodologically, one gradient descent update with supervision suffices and replaces the multi-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning scheme of [Kim and Suzuki, ICLR 2025] for solving Boolean problems. Together, the bounds expose a fundamental gap between what this minimal architecture achieves under ideal supervision and what is provably impossible under standard training.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Multi-Step Audio Source Separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio source separation aims to separate a mixture into target sources. Previous audio source separation systems usually conduct one-step inference, which does not fully explore the separation ability of models. In this work, we reveal that pretrained one-step audio source separation models can be leveraged for multi-step separation without additional training. We propose a simple yet effective inference method that iteratively applies separation by optimally blending the input mixture with the previous step's separation result. At each step, we determine the optimal blending ratio by maximizing a metric. We prove that our method always yield improvement over one-step inference, provide error bounds based on model smoothness and metric robustness, and provide theoretical analysis connecting our method to denoising along linear interpolation paths between noise and clean distributions, a property we link to denoising diffusion bridge models. Our approach effectively delivers improved separation performance as a "free lunch" from existing models. Our empirical results demonstrate that our multi-step separation approach consistently outperforms one-step inference across both speech enhancement and music source separation tasks, and can achieve scaling performance similar to training a larger model, using more data, or in some cases employing a multi-step training objective. These improvements appear not only on the optimization metric during multi-step inference, but also extend to nearly all non-optimized metrics (with one exception). We also discuss limitations of our approach and directions for future research.</description>

      <title>FlowCut: Rethinking Redundancy via Information Flow for Efficient Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) excel at multimodal understanding but suffer from high computational costs due to redundant vision tokens. Existing pruning methods typically rely on single-layer attention scores to rank and prune redundant visual tokens to solve this inefficiency. However, as the interaction between tokens and layers is complicated, this raises a basic question: Is such a simple single-layer criterion sufficient to identify redundancy? To answer this question, we rethink the emergence of redundant visual tokens from a fundamental perspective: information flow, which models the interaction between tokens and layers by capturing how information moves between tokens across layers. We find (1) the CLS token acts as an information relay, which can simplify the complicated flow analysis; (2) the redundancy emerges progressively and dynamically via layer-wise attention concentration; and (3) relying solely on attention scores from single layers can lead to contradictory redundancy identification. Based on this, we propose FlowCut, an information-flow-aware pruning framework, mitigating the insufficiency of the current criterion for identifying redundant tokens and better aligning with the model's inherent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that FlowCut achieves superior results, outperforming SoTA by 1.6% on LLaVA-1.5-7B with 88.9% token reduction, and by 4.3% on LLaVA-NeXT-7B with 94.4% reduction, delivering 3.2x speed-up in the prefilling stage.

      <title>DoctorRAG: Medical RAG Fusing Knowledge with Patient Analogy through Textual Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing medical RAG systems mainly leverage knowledge from medical knowledge bases, neglecting the crucial role of experiential knowledge derived from similar patient cases -- a key component of human clinical reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose DoctorRAG, a RAG framework that emulates doctor-like reasoning by integrating both explicit clinical knowledge and implicit case-based experience. DoctorRAG enhances retrieval precision by first allocating conceptual tags for queries and knowledge sources, together with a hybrid retrieval mechanism from both relevant knowledge and patient. In addition, a Med-TextGrad module using multi-agent textual gradients is integrated to ensure that the final output adheres to the retrieved knowledge and patient query. Comprehensive experiments on multilingual, multitask datasets demonstrate that DoctorRAG significantly outperforms strong baseline RAG models and gains improvements from iterative refinements. Our approach generates more accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses, taking a step towards more doctor-like medical reasoning systems.</description>

      <title>STRAP: Spatio-Temporal Pattern Retrieval for Out-of-Distribution Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling dynamic graph-structured data across diverse domains. However, they often fail to generalize in Spatio-Temporal Out-of-Distribution (STOOD) scenarios, where both temporal dynamics and spatial structures evolve beyond the training distribution. To address this problem, we propose an innovative Spatio-Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Pattern Learning framework,STRAP, which enhances model generalization by integrating retrieval-augmented learning into the STGNN continue learning pipeline. The core of STRAP is a compact and expressive pattern library that stores representative spatio-temporal patterns enriched with historical, structural, and semantic information, which is obtained and optimized during the training phase. During inference, STRAP retrieves relevant patterns from this library based on similarity to the current input and injects them into the model via a plug-and-play prompting mechanism. This not only strengthens spatio-temporal representations but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, STRAP introduces a knowledge-balancing objective to harmonize new information with retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world streaming graph datasets show that STRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art STGNN baselines on STOOD tasks, demonstrating its robustness, adaptability, and strong generalization capability without task-specific fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>How Syntax Specialization Emerges in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been found to develop surprising internal specializations: Individual neurons, attention heads, and circuits become selectively sensitive to syntactic structure, reflecting patterns observed in the human brain. While this specialization is well-documented, how it emerges during training and what influences its development remains largely unknown.
  In this work, we tap into the black box of specialization by tracking its formation over time. By quantifying internal syntactic consistency across minimal pairs from various syntactic phenomena, we identify a clear developmental trajectory: Syntactic sensitivity emerges gradually, concentrates in specific layers, and exhibits a 'critical period' of rapid internal specialization. This process is consistent across architectures and initialization parameters (e.g., random seeds), and is influenced by model scale and training data. We therefore reveal not only where syntax arises in LLMs but also how some models internalize it during training. To support future research, we will release the code, models, and training checkpoints upon acceptance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model editing aims to correct errors and outdated knowledge in the Large language models (LLMs) with minimal cost. Prior research has proposed a variety of datasets to assess the effectiveness of these model editing methods. However, most existing datasets only require models to output short phrases or sentences, overlooks the widespread existence of document-level tasks in the real world, raising doubts about their practical usability. Aimed at addressing this limitation and promoting the application of model editing in real-world scenarios, we propose the task of document-level model editing. To tackle such challenges and enhance model capabilities in practical settings, we introduce \benchmarkname, a dataset focused on document-level model editing, characterized by document-level inputs and outputs, extrapolative, and multiple facts within a single edit. We propose a series of evaluation metrics and experiments. The results show that the difficulties in document-level model editing pose challenges for existing model editing methods.</description>

      <title>Situationally-Aware Dynamics Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous robots operating in complex, unstructured environments face significant challenges due to latent, unobserved factors that obscure their understanding of both their internal state and the external world. Addressing this challenge would enable robots to develop a more profound grasp of their operational context. To tackle this, we propose a novel framework for online learning of hidden state representations, with which the robots can adapt in real-time to uncertain and dynamic conditions that would otherwise be ambiguous and result in suboptimal or erroneous behaviors. Our approach is formalized as a Generalized Hidden Parameter Markov Decision Process, which explicitly models the influence of unobserved parameters on both transition dynamics and reward structures. Our core innovation lies in learning online the joint distribution of state transitions, which serves as an expressive representation of latent ego- and environmental-factors. This probabilistic approach supports the identification and adaptation to different operational situations, improving robustness and safety. Through a multivariate extension of Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection, our method segments changes in the underlying data generating process governing the robot's dynamics. The robot's transition model is then informed with a symbolic representation of the current situation derived from the joint distribution of latest state transitions, enabling adaptive and context-aware decision-making. To showcase the real-world effectiveness, we validate our approach in the challenging task of unstructured terrain navigation, where unmodeled and unmeasured terrain characteristics can significantly impact the robot's motion. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real world reveal significant improvements in data efficiency, policy performance, and the emergence of safer, adaptive navigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Prefilling for Long-Context LLMs via Sparse Pattern Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse attention methods exploit the inherent sparsity in attention to speed up the prefilling phase of long-context inference, mitigating the quadratic complexity of full attention computation. While existing sparse attention methods rely on predefined patterns or inaccurate estimations to approximate attention behavior, they often fail to fully capture the true dynamics of attention, resulting in reduced efficiency and compromised accuracy. Instead, we propose a highly accurate sparse attention mechanism that shares similar yet precise attention patterns across heads, enabling a more realistic capture of the dynamic behavior of attention. Our approach is grounded in two key observations: (1) attention patterns demonstrate strong inter-head similarity, and (2) this similarity remains remarkably consistent across diverse inputs. By strategically sharing computed accurate patterns across attention heads, our method effectively captures actual patterns while requiring full attention computation for only a small subset of heads. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves superior or comparable speedup relative to state-of-the-art methods while delivering the best overall accuracy.</description>

      <title>LogiCoL: Logically-Informed Contrastive Learning for Set-based Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While significant progress has been made with dual- and bi-encoder dense retrievers, they often struggle on queries with logical connectives, a use case that is often overlooked yet important in downstream applications. Current dense retrievers struggle with such queries, such that the retrieved results do not respect the logical constraints implied in the queries. To address this challenge, we introduce LogiCoL, a logically-informed contrastive learning objective for dense retrievers. LogiCoL builds upon in-batch supervised contrastive learning, and learns dense retrievers to respect the subset and mutually-exclusive set relation between query results via two sets of soft constraints expressed via t-norm in the learning objective. We evaluate the effectiveness of LogiCoL on the task of entity retrieval, where the model is expected to retrieve a set of entities in Wikipedia that satisfy the implicit logical constraints in the query. We show that models trained with LogiCoL yield improvement both in terms of retrieval performance and logical consistency in the results. We provide detailed analysis and insights to uncover why queries with logical connectives are challenging for dense retrievers and why LogiCoL is most effective.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Collaboration via Evolving Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results across diverse downstream tasks, but their monolithic nature restricts scalability and efficiency in complex problem-solving. While recent research explores multi-agent collaboration among LLMs, most approaches rely on static organizational structures that struggle to adapt as task complexity and agent numbers grow, resulting in coordination overhead and inefficiencies. To this end, we propose a puppeteer-style paradigm for LLM-based multi-agent collaboration, where a centralized orchestrator ("puppeteer") dynamically directs agents ("puppets") in response to evolving task states. This orchestrator is trained via reinforcement learning to adaptively sequence and prioritize agents, enabling flexible and evolvable collective reasoning. Experiments on closed- and open-domain scenarios show that this method achieves superior performance with reduced computational costs. Analyses further reveal that the key improvements consistently stem from the emergence of more compact, cyclic reasoning structures under the orchestrator's evolution.</description>

      <title>Inconsistent Tokenizations Cause Language Models to be Perplexed by Japanese Grammar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typical methods for evaluating the performance of language models evaluate their ability to answer questions accurately. These evaluation metrics are acceptable for determining the extent to which language models can understand and reason about text in a general sense, but fail to capture nuanced capabilities, such as the ability of language models to recognize and obey rare grammar points, particularly in languages other than English. We measure the perplexity of language models when confronted with the "first person psych predicate restriction" grammar point in Japanese. Weblab is the only tested open source model in the 7-10B parameter range which consistently assigns higher perplexity to ungrammatical psych predicate sentences than grammatical ones. We give evidence that Weblab's uniformly bad tokenization is a possible root cause for its good performance, and show that Llama 3's perplexity on grammatical psych predicate sentences can be reduced by orders of magnitude (28x difference) by restricting test sentences to those with uniformly well-behaved tokenizations. We show in further experiments on machine translation tasks that language models will use alternative grammar patterns in order to produce grammatical sentences when tokenization issues prevent the most natural sentence from being output.</description>

      <title>Preference Optimization by Estimating the Ratio of the Data Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) is widely used as a simple and stable method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. This paper investigates a generalized DPO loss that enables a policy model to match the target policy from a likelihood ratio estimation perspective. The ratio of the target policy provides a unique identification of the policy distribution without relying on reward models or partition functions. This allows the generalized loss to retain both simplicity and theoretical guarantees, which prior work such as $f$-PO fails to achieve simultaneously. We propose Bregman preference optimization (BPO), a generalized framework for ratio matching that provides a family of objective functions achieving target policy optimality. BPO subsumes DPO as a special case and offers tractable forms for all instances, allowing implementation with a few lines of code. We further develop scaled Basu's power divergence (SBA), a gradient scaling method that can be used for BPO instances. The BPO framework complements other DPO variants and is applicable to target policies defined by these variants. In experiments, unlike other probabilistic loss extensions such as $f$-DPO or $f$-PO, which exhibit a trade-off between generation fidelity and diversity, instances of BPO improve both win rate and entropy compared with DPO. When applied to Llama-3-Instruct-8B, BPO achieves state-of-the-art performance among Llama-3-8B backbones, with a 55.9\% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.</description>

      <title>Energy-based Preference Optimization for Test-time Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enhances model robustness by enabling adaptation to target distributions that differ from training distributions, improving real-world generalizability. Existing TTA approaches focus on adjusting the conditional distribution; however these methods often depend on uncertain predictions in the absence of label information, leading to unreliable performance. Energy-based frameworks suggest a promising alternative to address distribution shifts without relying on uncertain predictions, instead computing the marginal distribution of target data. However, they involve the critical challenge of requiring extensive SGLD sampling, which is impractical for test-time scenarios requiring immediate adaptation. In this work, we propose Energy-based Preference Optimization for Test-time Adaptation (EPOTTA), which is based on a sampling free strategy. We first parameterize the target model using a pretrained model and residual energy function, enabling marginal likelihood maximization of target data without sampling. Building on the observation that the parameterization is mathematically equivalent to DPO objective, we then directly adapt the model to a target distribution without explicitly training the residual. Our experiments verify that EPOTTA is well-calibrated and performant while achieving computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Skrull: Towards Efficient Long Context Fine-tuning through Dynamic Data Scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-context supervised fine-tuning (Long-SFT) plays a vital role in enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on long-context tasks. To smoothly adapt LLMs to long-context scenarios, this process typically entails training on mixed datasets containing both long and short sequences. However, this heterogeneous sequence length distribution poses significant challenges for existing training systems, as they fail to simultaneously achieve high training efficiency for both long and short sequences, resulting in sub-optimal end-to-end system performance in Long-SFT. In this paper, we present a novel perspective on data scheduling to address the challenges posed by the heterogeneous data distributions in Long-SFT. We propose Skrull, a dynamic data scheduler specifically designed for efficient long-SFT. Through dynamic data scheduling, Skrull balances the computation requirements of long and short sequences, improving overall training efficiency. Furthermore, we formulate the scheduling process as a joint optimization problem and thoroughly analyze the trade-offs involved. Based on those analysis, Skrull employs a lightweight scheduling algorithm to achieve near-zero cost online scheduling in Long-SFT. Finally, we implement Skrull upon DeepSpeed, a state-of-the-art distributed training system for LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that Skrull outperforms DeepSpeed by 3.76x on average (up to 7.54x) in real-world long-SFT scenarios.</description>

      <title>Align and Surpass Human Camouflaged Perception: Visual Refocus Reinforcement Fine-Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current multi-modal models exhibit a notable misalignment with the human visual system when identifying objects that are visually assimilated into the background. Our observations reveal that these multi-modal models cannot distinguish concealed objects, demonstrating an inability to emulate human cognitive processes which effectively utilize foreground-background similarity principles for visual analysis. To analyze this hidden human-model visual thinking discrepancy, we build a visual system that mimicks human visual camouflaged perception to progressively and iteratively `refocus' visual concealed content. The refocus is a progressive guidance mechanism enabling models to logically localize objects in visual images through stepwise reasoning. The localization process of concealed objects requires hierarchical attention shifting with dynamic adjustment and refinement of prior cognitive knowledge. In this paper, we propose a visual refocus reinforcement framework via the policy optimization algorithm to encourage multi-modal models to think and refocus more before answering, and achieve excellent reasoning abilities to align and even surpass human camouflaged perception systems. Our extensive experiments on camouflaged perception successfully demonstrate the emergence of refocus visual phenomena, characterized by multiple reasoning tokens and dynamic adjustment of the detection box. Besides, experimental results on both camouflaged object classification and detection tasks exhibit significantly superior performance compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) baselines.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing and Mitigating Modality Interference in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across tasks, yet they often exhibit difficulty in distinguishing task-relevant from irrelevant signals, particularly in tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA), which can lead to susceptibility to misleading or spurious inputs. We refer to this broader limitation as the Cross-Modality Competency Problem: the model's inability to fairly evaluate all modalities. This vulnerability becomes more evident in modality-specific tasks such as image classification or pure text question answering, where models are expected to rely solely on one modality. In such tasks, spurious information from irrelevant modalities often leads to significant performance degradation. We refer to this failure as Modality Interference, which serves as a concrete and measurable instance of the cross-modality competency problem. We further design a perturbation-based causal diagnostic experiment to verify and quantify this problem. To mitigate modality interference, we propose a novel framework to fine-tune MLLMs, including perturbation-based data augmentations with both heuristic perturbations and adversarial perturbations via Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and a consistency regularization strategy applied to model outputs with original and perturbed inputs. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets (image-heavy, text-heavy, and VQA tasks) and multiple model families with different scales demonstrate significant improvements in robustness and cross-modality competency, indicating our method's effectiveness in boosting unimodal reasoning ability while enhancing performance on multimodal tasks.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Spatio-Temporal Prediction: When Lightweight Large Models Meet Adaptive Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal prediction is a pivotal task with broad applications in traffic management, climate monitoring, energy scheduling, etc. However, existing methodologies often struggle to balance model expressiveness and computational efficiency, especially when scaling to large real-world datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose STH-SepNet (Spatio-Temporal Hypergraph Separation Networks), a novel framework that decouples temporal and spatial modeling to enhance both efficiency and precision. Therein, the temporal dimension is modeled using lightweight large language models, which effectively capture low-rank temporal dynamics. Concurrently, the spatial dimension is addressed through an adaptive hypergraph neural network, which dynamically constructs hyperedges to model intricate, higher-order interactions. A carefully designed gating mechanism is integrated to seamlessly fuse temporal and spatial representations. By leveraging the fundamental principles of low-rank temporal dynamics and spatial interactions, STH-SepNet offers a pragmatic and scalable solution for spatio-temporal prediction in real-world applications. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of STH-SepNet in boosting predictive performance while maintaining computational efficiency. This work may provide a promising lightweight framework for spatio-temporal prediction, aiming to reduce computational demands and while enhancing predictive performance. Our code is avaliable at https://github.com/SEU-WENJIA/ST-SepNet-Lightweight-LLMs-Meet-Adaptive-Hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>AgentRecBench: Benchmarking LLM Agent-based Personalized Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of agentic recommender systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a paradigm shift in personalized recommendations, leveraging LLMs' advanced reasoning and role-playing capabilities to enable autonomous, adaptive decision-making. Unlike traditional recommendation approaches, agentic recommender systems can dynamically gather and interpret user-item interactions from complex environments, generating robust recommendation strategies that generalize across diverse scenarios. However, the field currently lacks standardized evaluation protocols to systematically assess these methods. To address this critical gap, we propose: (1) an interactive textual recommendation simulator incorporating rich user and item metadata and three typical evaluation scenarios (classic, evolving-interest, and cold-start recommendation tasks); (2) a unified modular framework for developing and studying agentic recommender systems; and (3) the first comprehensive benchmark comparing 10 classical and agentic recommendation methods. Our findings demonstrate the superiority of agentic systems and establish actionable design guidelines for their core components. The benchmark environment has been rigorously validated through an open challenge and remains publicly available with a continuously maintained leaderboard~\footnote[2]{https://tsinghua-fib-lab.github.io/AgentSocietyChallenge/pages/overview.html}, fostering ongoing community engagement and reproducible research. The benchmark is available at: \hyperlink{https://huggingface.co/datasets/SGJQovo/AgentRecBench}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/SGJQovo/AgentRecBench}.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Large Multimodal Models for Ophthalmic Visual Question Answering with OphthalWeChat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a bilingual multimodal visual question answering (VQA) benchmark for evaluating VLMs in ophthalmology. Methods: Ophthalmic image posts and associated captions published between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2024, were collected from WeChat Official Accounts. Based on these captions, bilingual question-answer (QA) pairs in Chinese and English were generated using GPT-4o-mini. QA pairs were categorized into six subsets by question type and language: binary (Binary_CN, Binary_EN), single-choice (Single-choice_CN, Single-choice_EN), and open-ended (Open-ended_CN, Open-ended_EN). The benchmark was used to evaluate the performance of three VLMs: GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct. Results: The final OphthalWeChat dataset included 3,469 images and 30,120 QA pairs across 9 ophthalmic subspecialties, 548 conditions, 29 imaging modalities, and 68 modality combinations. Gemini 2.0 Flash achieved the highest overall accuracy (0.548), outperforming GPT-4o (0.522, P &lt; 0.001) and Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct (0.514, P &lt; 0.001). It also led in both Chinese (0.546) and English subsets (0.550). Subset-specific performance showed Gemini 2.0 Flash excelled in Binary_CN (0.687), Single-choice_CN (0.666), and Single-choice_EN (0.646), while GPT-4o ranked highest in Binary_EN (0.717), Open-ended_CN (BLEU-1: 0.301; BERTScore: 0.382), and Open-ended_EN (BLEU-1: 0.183; BERTScore: 0.240). Conclusions: This study presents the first bilingual VQA benchmark for ophthalmology, distinguished by its real-world context and inclusion of multiple examinations per patient. The dataset reflects authentic clinical decision-making scenarios and enables quantitative evaluation of VLMs, supporting the development of accurate, specialized, and trustworthy AI systems for eye care.</description>

      <title>Search-Based Software Engineering in the Landscape of AI Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Search-based software engineering (SBSE), at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and software engineering, has been an active area of research for about 25 years. It has been applied to solve numerous problems across the entire software engineering lifecycle and has demonstrated its versatility in multiple domains. With the recent advancements in AI, particularly the emergence of foundation models (FMs), the evolution of SBSE alongside FMs remains undetermined. In this window of opportunity, we propose a research roadmap that articulates the current landscape of SBSE in relation to foundation models (FMs), highlights open challenges, and outlines potential research directions for advancing SBSE through its interplay with FMs. This roadmap aims to establish a forward-thinking and innovative perspective for the future of SBSE in the era of FMs.</description>

      <title>Segment First or Comprehend First? Explore the Limit of Unsupervised Word Segmentation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Word segmentation stands as a cornerstone of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Based on the concept of "comprehend first, segment later", we propose a new framework to explore the limit of unsupervised word segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs based on word segmentation. We employ current mainstream LLMs to perform word segmentation across multiple languages to assess LLMs' "comprehension". Our findings reveal that LLMs are capable of following simple prompts to segment raw text into words. There is a trend suggesting that models with more parameters tend to perform better on multiple languages. Additionally, we introduce a novel unsupervised method, termed LLACA ($\textbf{L}$arge $\textbf{L}$anguage Model-Inspired $\textbf{A}$ho-$\textbf{C}$orasick $\textbf{A}$utomaton). Leveraging the advanced pattern recognition capabilities of Aho-Corasick automata, LLACA innovatively combines these with the deep insights of well-pretrained LLMs. This approach not only enables the construction of a dynamic $n$-gram model that adjusts based on contextual information but also integrates the nuanced understanding of LLMs, offering significant improvements over traditional methods.

      <title>STOPA: A Database of Systematic VariaTion Of DeePfake Audio for Open-Set Source Tracing and Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key research area in deepfake speech detection is source tracing - determining the origin of synthesised utterances. The approaches may involve identifying the acoustic model (AM), vocoder model (VM), or other generation-specific parameters. However, progress is limited by the lack of a dedicated, systematically curated dataset. To address this, we introduce STOPA, a systematically varied and metadata-rich dataset for deepfake speech source tracing, covering 8 AMs, 6 VMs, and diverse parameter settings across 700k samples from 13 distinct synthesisers. Unlike existing datasets, which often feature limited variation or sparse metadata, STOPA provides a systematically controlled framework covering a broader range of generative factors, such as the choice of the vocoder model, acoustic model, or pretrained weights, ensuring higher attribution reliability. This control improves attribution accuracy, aiding forensic analysis, deepfake detection, and generative model transparency.</description>

      <title>MoESD: Unveil Speculative Decoding's Potential for Accelerating Sparse MoE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across many applications, with Mixture of Experts (MoE) models demonstrating great potential. Compared to traditional dense models, MoEs achieve better performance with less computation. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to accelerate LLM inference without accuracy loss, but it has been considered efficient only for dense models. In this work, we first demonstrate that, under medium batch sizes, MoE surprisingly benefits more from SD than dense models. Furthermore, as MoE becomes sparser -- the prevailing trend in MoE designs -- the batch size range where SD acceleration is expected to be effective becomes broader. To quantitatively understand tradeoffs involved in SD, we develop a reliable modeling based on theoretical analyses. While current SD research primarily focuses on improving acceptance rates of algorithms, changes in workload and model architecture can still lead to degraded SD acceleration even with high acceptance rates. To address this limitation, we introduce a new metric 'target efficiency' that characterizes these effects, thus helping researchers identify system bottlenecks and understand SD acceleration more comprehensively. For scenarios like private serving, this work unveils a new perspective to speed up MoE inference, where existing solutions struggle. Experiments on different GPUs show up to 2.29x speedup for Qwen2-57B-A14B at medium batch sizes and validate our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Model Enumeration of Two-Variable Logic with Quadratic Delay Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the model enumeration problem of the function-free, finite domain fragment of first-order logic with two variables ($FO^2$). Specifically, given an $FO^2$ sentence $\Gamma$ and a positive integer $n$, how can one enumerate all the models of $\Gamma$ over a domain of size $n$? In this paper, we devise a novel algorithm to address this problem. The delay complexity, the time required between producing two consecutive models, of our algorithm is quadratic in the given domain size $n$ (up to logarithmic factors) when the sentence is fixed. This complexity is almost optimal since the interpretation of binary predicates in any model requires at least $\Omega(n^2)$ bits to represent.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models in Code Co-generation for Safe Autonomous Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software engineers in various industrial domains are already using Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate the process of implementing parts of software systems. When considering its potential use for ADAS or AD systems in the automotive context, there is a need to systematically assess this new setup: LLMs entail a well-documented set of risks for safety-related systems' development due to their stochastic nature. To reduce the effort for code reviewers to evaluate LLM-generated code, we propose an evaluation pipeline to conduct sanity-checks on the generated code. We compare the performance of six state-of-the-art LLMs (CodeLlama, CodeGemma, DeepSeek-r1, DeepSeek-Coders, Mistral, and GPT-4) on four safety-related programming tasks. Additionally, we qualitatively analyse the most frequent faults generated by these LLMs, creating a failure-mode catalogue to support human reviewers. Finally, the limitations and capabilities of LLMs in code generation, and the use of the proposed pipeline in the existing process, are discussed.</description>

      <title>GenKI: Enhancing Open-Domain Question Answering with Knowledge Integration and Controllable Generation in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-domain question answering (OpenQA) represents a cornerstone in natural language processing (NLP), primarily focused on extracting answers from unstructured textual data. With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based OpenQA methods have reaped the benefits of emergent understanding and answering capabilities enabled by massive parameters compared to traditional methods. However, most of these methods encounter two critical challenges: how to integrate knowledge into LLMs effectively and how to adaptively generate results with specific answer formats for various task situations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named GenKI, which aims to improve the OpenQA performance by exploring Knowledge Integration and controllable Generation on LLMs simultaneously. Specifically, we first train a dense passage retrieval model to retrieve associated knowledge from a given knowledge base. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge integration model that incorporates the retrieval knowledge into instructions during fine-tuning to intensify the model. Furthermore, to enable controllable generation in LLMs, we leverage a certain fine-tuned LLM and an ensemble based on text consistency incorporating all coherence, fluency, and answer format assurance. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, MSMARCO, and CMRC2018 datasets, featuring diverse answer formats, have demonstrated the effectiveness of GenKI with comparison of state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, ablation studies have disclosed a linear relationship between the frequency of retrieved knowledge and the model's ability to recall knowledge accurately against the ground truth. Our code of GenKI is available at https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/GenKI</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Real-World Assessment of Audio Watermarking Algorithms: Will They Survive Neural Codecs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework to foster the evaluation of deep learning-based audio watermarking algorithms, establishing a standardized benchmark and allowing systematic comparisons. To simulate real-world usage, we introduce a comprehensive audio attack pipeline, featuring various distortions such as compression, background noise, and reverberation, and propose a diverse test dataset, including speech, environmental sounds, and music recordings. By assessing the performance of four existing watermarking algorithms on our framework, two main insights stand out: (i) neural compression techniques pose the most significant challenge, even when algorithms are trained with such compressions; and (ii) training with audio attacks generally improves robustness, although it is insufficient in some cases. Furthermore, we find that specific distortions, such as polarity inversion, time stretching, or reverb, seriously affect certain algorithms. Our contributions strengthen the robustness and perceptual assessment of audio watermarking algorithms across a wide range of applications, while ensuring a fair and consistent evaluation approach. The evaluation framework, including the attack pipeline, is accessible at github.com/SonyResearch/wm_robustness_eval.</description>

      <title>LeCoDe: A Benchmark Dataset for Interactive Legal Consultation Dialogue Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legal consultation is essential for safeguarding individual rights and ensuring access to justice, yet remains costly and inaccessible to many individuals due to the shortage of professionals. While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward scalable, low-cost legal assistance, current systems fall short in handling the interactive and knowledge-intensive nature of real-world consultations. To address these challenges, we introduce LeCoDe, a real-world multi-turn benchmark dataset comprising 3,696 legal consultation dialogues with 110,008 dialogue turns, designed to evaluate and improve LLMs' legal consultation capability. With LeCoDe, we innovatively collect live-streamed consultations from short-video platforms, providing authentic multi-turn legal consultation dialogues. The rigorous annotation by legal experts further enhances the dataset with professional insights and expertise. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses LLMs' consultation capabilities in terms of (1) clarification capability and (2) professional advice quality. This unified framework incorporates 12 metrics across two dimensions. Through extensive experiments on various general and domain-specific LLMs, our results reveal significant challenges in this task, with even state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 achieving only 39.8% recall for clarification and 59% overall score for advice quality, highlighting the complexity of professional consultation scenarios. Based on these findings, we further explore several strategies to enhance LLMs' legal consultation abilities. Our benchmark contributes to advancing research in legal domain dialogue systems, particularly in simulating more real-world user-expert interactions.</description>

      <title>Automated evaluation of children's speech fluency for low-resource languages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessment of children's speaking fluency in education is well researched for majority languages, but remains highly challenging for low resource languages. This paper proposes a system to automatically assess fluency by combining a fine-tuned multilingual ASR model, an objective metrics extraction stage, and a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) network. The objective metrics include phonetic and word error rates, speech rate, and speech-pause duration ratio. These are interpreted by a GPT-based classifier guided by a small set of human-evaluated ground truth examples, to score fluency. We evaluate the proposed system on a dataset of children's speech in two low-resource languages, Tamil and Malay and compare the classification performance against Random Forest and XGBoost, as well as using ChatGPT-4o to predict fluency directly from speech input. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significantly higher accuracy than multimodal GPT or other methods.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Pre-trained Language Classifiers on LLM-generated Noisy Labels via Iterative Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traditional process of creating labeled datasets is labor-intensive and expensive. Recent breakthroughs in open-source large language models (LLMs) have opened up a new avenue in generating labeled datasets automatically for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, providing an alternative to such an expensive annotation process. However, the reliability of such auto-generated labels remains a significant concern due to inherent inaccuracies. When learning from noisy labels, the model's generalization is likely to be harmed as it is prone to overfit to those label noises. While previous studies in learning from noisy labels mainly focus on synthetic noise and real-world noise, LLM-generated label noise receives less attention. In this paper, we propose SiDyP: Simplex Label Diffusion with Dynamic Prior to calibrate the classifier's prediction, thus enhancing its robustness towards LLM-generated noisy labels. SiDyP retrieves potential true label candidates by neighborhood label distribution in text embedding space and iteratively refines noisy candidates using a simplex diffusion model. Our framework can increase the performance of the BERT classifier fine-tuned on both zero-shot and few-shot LLM-generated noisy label datasets by an average of 7.21% and 7.30% respectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SiDyP by conducting extensive benchmarking for different LLMs over a variety of NLP tasks. Our code is available on Github.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents KIT's submissions to the IWSLT 2025 low-resource track. We develop both cascaded systems, consisting of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) models, and end-to-end (E2E) Speech Translation (ST) systems for three language pairs: Bemba, North Levantine Arabic, and Tunisian Arabic into English. Building upon pre-trained models, we fine-tune our systems with different strategies to utilize resources efficiently. This study further explores system enhancement with synthetic data and model regularization. Specifically, we investigate MT-augmented ST by generating translations from ASR data using MT models. For North Levantine, which lacks parallel ST training data, a system trained solely on synthetic data slightly surpasses the cascaded system trained on real data. We also explore augmentation using text-to-speech models by generating synthetic speech from MT data, demonstrating the benefits of synthetic data in improving both ASR and ST performance for Bemba. Additionally, we apply intra-distillation to enhance model performance. Our experiments show that this approach consistently improves results across ASR, MT, and ST tasks, as well as across different pre-trained models. Finally, we apply Minimum Bayes Risk decoding to combine the cascaded and end-to-end systems, achieving an improvement of approximately 1.5 BLEU points.</description>

      <title>DiEmo-TTS: Disentangled Emotion Representations via Self-Supervised Distillation for Cross-Speaker Emotion Transfer in Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-speaker emotion transfer in speech synthesis relies on extracting speaker-independent emotion embeddings for accurate emotion modeling without retaining speaker traits. However, existing timbre compression methods fail to fully separate speaker and emotion characteristics, causing speaker leakage and degraded synthesis quality. To address this, we propose DiEmo-TTS, a self-supervised distillation method to minimize emotional information loss and preserve speaker identity. We introduce cluster-driven sampling and information perturbation to preserve emotion while removing irrelevant factors. To facilitate this process, we propose an emotion clustering and matching approach using emotional attribute prediction and speaker embeddings, enabling generalization to unlabeled data. Additionally, we designed a dual conditioning transformer to integrate style features better. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method in learning speaker-irrelevant emotion embeddings.</description>

      <title>EmoSphere-SER: Enhancing Speech Emotion Recognition Through Spherical Representation with Auxiliary Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition predicts a speaker's emotional state from speech signals using discrete labels or continuous dimensions such as arousal, valence, and dominance (VAD). We propose EmoSphere-SER, a joint model that integrates spherical VAD region classification to guide VAD regression for improved emotion prediction. In our framework, VAD values are transformed into spherical coordinates that are divided into multiple spherical regions, and an auxiliary classification task predicts which spherical region each point belongs to, guiding the regression process. Additionally, we incorporate a dynamic weighting scheme and a style pooling layer with multi-head self-attention to capture spectral and temporal dynamics, further boosting performance. This combined training strategy reinforces structured learning and improves prediction consistency. Experimental results show that our approach exceeds baseline methods, confirming the validity of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>JEDI: Latent End-to-end Diffusion Mitigates Agent-Human Performance Asymmetry in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) have achieved super-human level performance on the Atari100k benchmark, driven by reinforcement learning agents trained on powerful diffusion world models. However, we identify that the current aggregates mask a major performance asymmetry: MBRL agents dramatically outperform humans in some tasks despite drastically underperforming in others, with the former inflating the aggregate metrics. This is especially pronounced in pixel-based agents trained with diffusion world models. In this work, we address the pronounced asymmetry observed in pixel-based agents as an initial attempt to reverse the worrying upward trend observed in them. We address the problematic aggregates by delineating all tasks as Agent-Optimal or Human-Optimal and advocate for equal importance on metrics from both sets. Next, we hypothesize this pronounced asymmetry is due to the lack of temporally-structured latent space trained with the World Model objective in pixel-based methods. Lastly, to address this issue, we propose Joint Embedding DIffusion (JEDI), a novel latent diffusion world model trained end-to-end with the self-consistency objective. JEDI outperforms SOTA models in human-optimal tasks while staying competitive across the Atari100k benchmark, and runs 3 times faster with 43% lower memory than the latest pixel-based diffusion baseline. Overall, our work rethinks what it truly means to cross human-level performance in Atari100k.</description>

      <title>Mosaic: Data-Free Knowledge Distillation via Mixture-of-Experts for Heterogeneous Distributed Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables clients to collaboratively train models while preserving data privacy. However, the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity gives rise to inconsistent representations and divergent optimization dynamics across clients, ultimately hindering robust global performance. To transcend these challenges, we propose Mosaic, a novel data-free knowledge distillation framework tailored for heterogeneous distributed environments. Mosaic first trains local generative models to approximate each client's personalized distribution, enabling synthetic data generation that safeguards privacy through strict separation from real data. Subsequently, Mosaic forms a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) from client models based on their specialized knowledge, and distills it into a global model using the generated data. To further enhance the MoE architecture, Mosaic integrates expert predictions via a lightweight meta model trained on a few representative prototypes. Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that Mosaic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under both model and data heterogeneity.

      <title>Leveraging Importance Sampling to Detach Alignment Modules from Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) across industries has increased the demand for high-quality and customizable outputs. However, traditional alignment methods often require retraining large pretrained models, making it difficult to quickly adapt and optimize LLMs for diverse applications. To address this limitation, we propose a novel \textit{Residual Alignment Model} (\textit{RAM}) that formalizes the alignment process as a type of importance sampling. In this framework, the unaligned upstream model serves as the proposal distribution, while the alignment process is framed as secondary sampling based on an autoregressive alignment module that acts as an estimator of the importance weights. This design enables a natural detachment of the alignment module from the target aligned model, improving flexibility and scalability. Based on this model, we derive an efficient sequence-level training strategy for the alignment module, which operates independently of the proposal module. Additionally, we develop a resampling algorithm with iterative token-level decoding to address the common first-token latency issue in comparable methods. Experimental evaluations on two leading open-source LLMs across diverse tasks, including instruction following, domain adaptation, and preference optimization, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baseline models.</description>

      <title>Error Typing for Smarter Rewards: Improving Process Reward Models with Error-Aware Hierarchical Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, especially during multi-hop and reasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematical problem solving. While Outcome Reward Models verify only final answers, Process Reward Models (PRMs) score each intermediate step to steer generation toward coherent solutions. We introduce PathFinder-PRM, a novel hierarchical, error-aware discriminative PRM that first classifies math and consistency errors at each step, then combines these fine-grained signals to estimate step correctness. To train PathFinder-PRM, we construct a 400K-sample dataset by enriching the human-annotated PRM800K corpus and RLHFlow Mistral traces with three-dimensional step-level labels. On PRMBench, PathFinder-PRM achieves a new state-of-the-art PRMScore of 67.7, outperforming the prior best (65.5) while using 3 times less data. When applied to reward guided greedy search, our model yields prm@8 48.3, a +1.5 point gain over the strongest baseline. These results demonstrate that decoupled error detection and reward estimation not only boost fine-grained error detection but also substantially improve end-to-end, reward-guided mathematical reasoning with greater data efficiency.</description>

      <title>MT$^{3}$: Scaling MLLM-based Text Image Machine Translation via Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT)-the task of translating textual content embedded in images-is critical for applications in accessibility, cross-lingual information access, and real-world document understanding. However, TIMT remains a complex challenge due to the need for accurate optical character recognition (OCR), robust visual-text reasoning, and high-quality translation, often requiring cascading multi-stage pipelines. Recent advances in large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) have improved reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), but their application to end-to-end TIMT is still underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT$^{3}$, the first framework to apply Multi-Task RL to MLLMs for end-to-end TIMT. MT$^{3}$ adopts a multi-task optimization paradigm targeting three key sub-skills: text recognition, context-aware reasoning, and translation. It is trained using a novel multi-mixed reward mechanism that adapts rule-based RL strategies to TIMT's intricacies, offering fine-grained, non-binary feedback across tasks. Furthermore, to facilitate the evaluation of TIMT in authentic cross-cultural and real-world social media contexts, we introduced XHSPost, the first social media TIMT benchmark. Our MT$^{3}$-7B-Zero achieves state-of-the-art results on the latest in-domain MIT-10M benchmark, outperforming strong baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B by notable margins across multiple metrics. Additionally, the model shows strong generalization to out-of-distribution language pairs and datasets. In-depth analyses reveal how multi-task synergy, reinforcement learning initialization, curriculum design, and reward formulation contribute to advancing MLLM-driven TIMT.</description>

      <title>Graceful Forgetting in Generative Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the pretrain-finetune paradigm has become a cornerstone in various deep learning areas. While in general the pre-trained model would promote both effectiveness and efficiency of downstream tasks fine-tuning, studies have shown that not all knowledge acquired during pre-training is beneficial. Some of the knowledge may actually bring detrimental effects to the fine-tuning tasks, which is also known as negative transfer. To address this problem, graceful forgetting has emerged as a promising approach. The core principle of graceful forgetting is to enhance the learning plasticity of the target task by selectively discarding irrelevant knowledge. However, this approach remains underexplored in the context of generative language models, and it is often challenging to migrate existing forgetting algorithms to these models due to architecture incompatibility. To bridge this gap, in this paper we propose a novel framework, Learning With Forgetting (LWF), to achieve graceful forgetting in generative language models. With Fisher Information Matrix weighting the intended parameter updates, LWF computes forgetting confidence to evaluate self-generated knowledge regarding the forgetting task, and consequently, knowledge with high confidence is periodically unlearned during fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that, although thoroughly uncovering the mechanisms of knowledge interaction remains challenging in pre-trained language models, applying graceful forgetting can contribute to enhanced fine-tuning performance.</description>

      <title>OCN: Effectively Utilizing Higher-Order Common Neighbors for Better Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common Neighbors (CNs) and their higher-order variants are important pairwise features widely used in state-of-the-art link prediction methods. However, existing methods often struggle with the repetition across different orders of CNs and fail to fully leverage their potential. We identify that these limitations stem from two key issues: redundancy and over-smoothing in high-order common neighbors. To address these challenges, we design orthogonalization to eliminate redundancy between different-order CNs and normalization to mitigate over-smoothing. By combining these two techniques, we propose Orthogonal Common Neighbor (OCN), a novel approach that significantly outperforms the strongest baselines by an average of 7.7% on popular link prediction benchmarks. A thorough theoretical analysis is provided to support our method. Ablation studies also verify the effectiveness of our orthogonalization and normalization techniques.</description>

      <title>Distilling Closed-Source LLM's Knowledge for Locally Stable and Economic Biomedical Entity Linking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomedical entity linking aims to map nonstandard entities to standard entities in a knowledge base. Traditional supervised methods perform well but require extensive annotated data to transfer, limiting their usage in low-resource scenarios. Large language models (LLMs), especially closed-source LLMs, can address these but risk stability issues and high economic costs: using these models is restricted by commercial companies and brings significant economic costs when dealing with large amounts of data. To address this, we propose ``RPDR'', a framework combining closed-source LLMs and open-source LLMs for re-ranking candidates retrieved by a retriever fine-tuned with a small amount of data. By prompting a closed-source LLM to generate training data from unannotated data and fine-tuning an open-source LLM for re-ranking, we effectively distill the knowledge to the open-source LLM that can be deployed locally, thus avoiding the stability issues and the problem of high economic costs. We evaluate RPDR on two datasets, including one real-world dataset and one publicly available dataset involving two languages: Chinese and English. RPDR achieves 0.019 Acc@1 improvement and 0.036 Acc@1 improvement on the Aier dataset and the Ask A Patient dataset when the amount of training data is not enough. The results demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of the proposed framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion has recently emerged as a promising paradigm in discrete data modeling. However, existing methods typically rely on a fixed rate transition matrix during training, which not only limits the expressiveness of latent representations, a fundamental strength of variational methods, but also constrains the overall design space. To address these limitations, we propose Discrete Markov Bridge, a novel framework specifically designed for discrete representation learning. Our approach is built upon two key components: Matrix Learning and Score Learning. We conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing formal performance guarantees for Matrix Learning and proving the convergence of the overall framework. Furthermore, we analyze the space complexity of our method, addressing practical constraints identified in prior studies. Extensive empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of the proposed Discrete Markov Bridge, which achieves an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) of 1.38 on the Text8 dataset, outperforming established baselines. Moreover, the proposed model demonstrates competitive performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving results comparable to those obtained by image-specific generation approaches.</description>

      <title>NeuSym-RAG: Hybrid Neural Symbolic Retrieval with Multiview Structuring for PDF Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing number of academic papers poses significant challenges for researchers to efficiently acquire key details. While retrieval augmented generation (RAG) shows great promise in large language model (LLM) based automated question answering, previous works often isolate neural and symbolic retrieval despite their complementary strengths. Moreover, conventional single-view chunking neglects the rich structure and layout of PDFs, e.g., sections and tables. In this work, we propose NeuSym-RAG, a hybrid neural symbolic retrieval framework which combines both paradigms in an interactive process. By leveraging multi-view chunking and schema-based parsing, NeuSym-RAG organizes semi-structured PDF content into both the relational database and vectorstore, enabling LLM agents to iteratively gather context until sufficient to generate answers. Experiments on three full PDF-based QA datasets, including a self-annotated one AIRQA-REAL, show that NeuSym-RAG stably defeats both the vector-based RAG and various structured baselines, highlighting its capacity to unify both retrieval schemes and utilize multiple views. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/X-LANCE/NeuSym-RAG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective generation of structured code comments requires robust quality metrics for dataset curation, yet existing approaches (SIDE, MIDQ, STASIS) suffer from limited code-comment analysis. We propose CIDRe, a language-agnostic reference-free quality criterion combining four synergistic aspects: (1) relevance (code-comment semantic alignment), (2) informativeness (functional coverage), (3) completeness (presence of all structure sections), and (4) description length (detail sufficiency). We validate our criterion on a manually annotated dataset. Experiments demonstrate CIDRe's superiority over existing metrics, achieving improvement in cross-entropy evaluation. When applied to filter comments, the models finetuned on CIDRe-filtered data show statistically significant quality gains in GPT-4o-mini assessments.</description>

      <title>Agentic Predictor: Performance Prediction for Agentic Workflows via Multi-View Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, but optimizing LLM-based agentic systems remains challenging due to the vast search space of agent configurations, prompting strategies, and communication patterns. Existing approaches often rely on heuristic-based tuning or exhaustive evaluation, which can be computationally expensive and suboptimal. This paper proposes Agentic Predictor, a lightweight predictor for efficient agentic workflow evaluation. Agentic Predictor is equipped with a multi-view workflow encoding technique that leverages multi-view representation learning of agentic systems by incorporating code architecture, textual prompts, and interaction graph features. To achieve high predictive accuracy while significantly reducing the number of required workflow evaluations for training a predictor, Agentic Predictor employs cross-domain unsupervised pretraining. By learning to approximate task success rates, Agentic Predictor enables fast and accurate selection of optimal agentic workflow configurations for a given task, significantly reducing the need for expensive trial-and-error evaluations. Experiments on a carefully curated benchmark spanning three domains show that our predictor outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and workflow utility, highlighting the potential of performance predictors in streamlining the design of LLM-based agentic workflows.</description>

      <title>TeViR: Text-to-Video Reward with Diffusion Models for Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing scalable and generalizable reward engineering for reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial for creating general-purpose agents, especially in the challenging domain of robotic manipulation. While recent advances in reward engineering with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise, their sparse reward nature significantly limits sample efficiency. This paper introduces TeViR, a novel method that leverages a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion model to generate dense rewards by comparing the predicted image sequence with current observations. Experimental results across 11 complex robotic tasks demonstrate that TeViR outperforms traditional methods leveraging sparse rewards and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving better sample efficiency and performance without ground truth environmental rewards. TeViR's ability to efficiently guide agents in complex environments highlights its potential to advance reinforcement learning applications in robotic manipulation.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Political Bias in LLMs via Target-Oriented Sentiment Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Political biases encoded by LLMs might have detrimental effects on downstream applications. Existing bias analysis methods rely on small-size intermediate tasks (questionnaire answering or political content generation) and rely on the LLMs themselves for analysis, thus propagating bias. We propose a new approach leveraging the observation that LLM sentiment predictions vary with the target entity in the same sentence. We define an entropy-based inconsistency metric to encode this prediction variability. We insert 1319 demographically and politically diverse politician names in 450 political sentences and predict target-oriented sentiment using seven models in six widely spoken languages. We observe inconsistencies in all tested combinations and aggregate them in a statistically robust analysis at different granularity levels. We observe positive and negative bias toward left and far-right politicians and positive correlations between politicians with similar alignment. Bias intensity is higher for Western languages than for others. Larger models exhibit stronger and more consistent biases and reduce discrepancies between similar languages. We partially mitigate LLM unreliability in target-oriented sentiment classification (TSC) by replacing politician names with fictional but plausible counterparts.</description>

      <title>MedDreamer: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Latent Imagination on Complex EHRs for Clinical Decision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timely and personalized treatment decisions are essential across a wide range of healthcare settings where patient responses vary significantly and evolve over time. Clinical data used to support these decisions are often irregularly sampled, sparse, and noisy. Existing decision support systems commonly rely on discretization and imputation, which can distort critical temporal dynamics and degrade decision quality. Moreover, they often overlook the clinical significance of irregular recording frequencies, filtering out patterns in how and when data is collected. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a natural fit for clinical decision-making, enabling sequential, long-term optimization in dynamic, uncertain environments. However, most existing treatment recommendation systems are model-free and trained solely on offline data, making them sample-inefficient, sensitive to data quality, and poorly generalizable across tasks or cohorts. To address these limitations, we propose MedDreamer, a two-phase model-based RL framework for personalized treatment recommendation. MedDreamer uses a world model with an Adaptive Feature Integration (AFI) module to effectively model irregular, sparse clinical data. Through latent imagination, it simulates plausible patient trajectories to enhance learning, refining its policy using a mix of real and imagined experiences. This enables learning policies that go beyond suboptimal historical decisions while remaining grounded in clinical data. To our knowledge, this is the first application of latent imagination to irregular healthcare data. Evaluations on sepsis and mechanical ventilation (MV) treatment using two large-scale EHR datasets show that MedDreamer outperforms both model-free and model-based baselines in clinical outcomes and off-policy metrics.</description>

      <title>Alpay Algebra III: Observer-Coupled Collapse and the Temporal Drift of Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a formal framework for modeling observer-dependent collapse dynamics and temporal identity drift within artificial and mathematical systems, grounded entirely in the symbolic foundations of Alpay Algebra. Building upon the fixed-point emergence structures developed in Alpay Algebra I and II, this third installment formalizes the observer-coupled {\phi}-collapse process through transfinite categorical flows and curvature-driven identity operators. We define a novel temporal drift mechanism as a recursive deformation of identity signatures under entangled observer influence, constructing categorical invariants that evolve across fold iterations. The proposed system surpasses conventional identity modeling in explainable AI (XAI) by encoding internal transformation history into a symbolic fixed-point structure, offering provable traceability and temporal coherence. Applications range from AI self-awareness architectures to formal logic systems where identity is not static but dynamically induced by observation. The theoretical results also offer a mathematically rigorous basis for future AI systems with stable self-referential behavior, positioning Alpay Algebra as a next-generation symbolic framework bridging category theory, identity logic, and observer dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Missing Point in Vision Transformers for Universal Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image segmentation remains a challenging task in computer vision, demanding robust mask generation and precise classification. Recent mask-based approaches yield high-quality masks by capturing global context. However, accurately classifying these masks, especially in the presence of ambiguous boundaries and imbalanced class distributions, remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce ViT-P, a novel two-stage segmentation framework that decouples mask generation from classification. The first stage employs a proposal generator to produce class-agnostic mask proposals, while the second stage utilizes a point-based classification model built on the Vision Transformer (ViT) to refine predictions by focusing on mask central points. ViT-P serves as a pre-training-free adapter, allowing the integration of various pre-trained vision transformers without modifying their architecture, ensuring adaptability to dense prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coarse and bounding box annotations can effectively enhance classification without requiring additional training on fine annotation datasets, reducing annotation costs while maintaining strong performance. Extensive experiments across COCO, ADE20K, and Cityscapes datasets validate the effectiveness of ViT-P, achieving state-of-the-art results with 54.0 PQ on ADE20K panoptic segmentation, 87.4 mIoU on Cityscapes semantic segmentation, and 63.6 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation.

      <title>Equivariant Representation Learning for Symmetry-Aware Inference with Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many real-world applications of regression, conditional probability estimation, and uncertainty quantification, exploiting symmetries rooted in physics or geometry can dramatically improve generalization and sample efficiency. While geometric deep learning has made significant empirical advances by incorporating group-theoretic structure, less attention has been given to statistical learning guarantees. In this paper, we introduce an equivariant representation learning framework that simultaneously addresses regression, conditional probability estimation, and uncertainty quantification while providing first-of-its-kind non-asymptotic statistical learning guarantees. Grounded in operator and group representation theory, our framework approximates the spectral decomposition of the conditional expectation operator, building representations that are both equivariant and disentangled along independent symmetry subgroups. Empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets and real-world robotics applications confirm the potential of our approach, matching or outperforming existing equivariant baselines in regression while additionally providing well-calibrated parametric uncertainty estimates.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Trajectory-Aided LLM Reasoning: An Optimization Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for comprehending the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through the perspective of meta-learning. By conceptualizing reasoning trajectories as pseudo-gradient descent updates to the LLM's parameters, we identify parallels between LLM reasoning and various meta-learning paradigms. We formalize the training process for reasoning tasks as a meta-learning setup, with each question treated as an individual task, and reasoning trajectories serving as the inner loop optimization for adapting model parameters. Once trained on a diverse set of questions, the LLM develops fundamental reasoning capabilities that can generalize to previously unseen questions. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the strong connection between LLM reasoning and meta-learning, exploring several issues of significant interest from a meta-learning standpoint. Our work not only enhances the understanding of LLM reasoning but also provides practical insights for improving these models through established meta-learning techniques.</description>

      <title>FinLoRA: Benchmarking LoRA Methods for Fine-Tuning LLMs on Financial Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) methods show great potential for scaling pre-trained general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) to hundreds or thousands of use scenarios. However, their efficacy in high-stakes domains like finance is rarely explored, e.g., passing CFA exams and analyzing SEC filings. In this paper, we present the open-source FinLoRA project that benchmarks LoRA methods on both general and highly professional financial tasks. First, we curated 19 datasets covering diverse financial applications; in particular, we created four novel XBRL analysis datasets based on 150 SEC filings. Second, we evaluated five LoRA methods and five base LLMs. Finally, we provide extensive experimental results in terms of accuracy, F1, and BERTScore and report computational cost in terms of time and GPU memory during fine-tuning and inference stages. We find that LoRA methods achieved substantial performance gains of 36\% on average over base models. Our FinLoRA project provides an affordable and scalable approach to democratize financial intelligence to the general public. Datasets, LoRA adapters, code, and documentation are available at https://github.com/Open-Finance-Lab/FinLoRA</description>

      <title>LAPA-based Dynamic Privacy Optimization for Wireless Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm based on protecting data privacy of devices, which however, can still be broken by gradient leakage attack via parameter inversion techniques. Differential privacy (DP) technology reduces the risk of private data leakage by adding artificial noise to the gradients, but detrimental to the FL utility at the same time, especially in the scenario where the data is Non-Independent Identically Distributed (Non-IID). Based on the impact of heterogeneous data on aggregation performance, this paper proposes a Lightweight Adaptive Privacy Allocation (LAPA) strategy, which assigns personalized privacy budgets to devices in each aggregation round without transmitting any additional information beyond gradients, ensuring both privacy protection and aggregation efficiency. Furthermore, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm is employed to optimize the transmission power, in order to determine the optimal timing at which the adaptively attenuated artificial noise aligns with the communication noise, enabling an effective balance between DP and system utility. Finally, a reliable aggregation strategy is designed by integrating communication quality and data distribution characteristics, which improves aggregation performance while preserving privacy. Experimental results demonstrate that the personalized noise allocation and dynamic optimization strategy based on LAPA proposed in this paper enhances convergence performance while satisfying the privacy requirements of FL.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models for Tabular Data within Systemic Contexts Need Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current research on tabular foundation models often overlooks the complexities of large-scale, real-world data by treating tables as isolated entities and assuming information completeness, thereby neglecting the vital operational context. To address this, we introduce the concept of Semantically Linked Tables (SLT), recognizing that tables are inherently connected to both declarative and procedural operational knowledge. We propose Foundation Models for Semantically Linked Tables (FMSLT), which integrate these components to ground tabular data within its true operational context. This comprehensive representation unlocks the full potential of machine learning for complex, interconnected tabular data across diverse domains. Realizing FMSLTs requires access to operational knowledge that is often unavailable in public datasets, highlighting the need for close collaboration between domain experts and researchers. Our work exposes the limitations of current tabular foundation models and proposes a new direction centered on FMSLTs, aiming to advance robust, context-aware models for structured data.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Glorot Initialization for Long-Range Linear Recurrences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proper initialization is critical for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly in long-range reasoning tasks, where repeated application of the same weight matrix can cause vanishing or exploding signals. A common baseline for linear recurrences is Glorot initialization, designed to ensure stable signal propagation--but derived under the infinite-width, fixed-length regime--an unrealistic setting for RNNs processing long sequences. In this work, we show that Glorot initialization is in fact unstable: small positive deviations in the spectral radius are amplified through time and cause the hidden state to explode. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that sequences of length $t = O(\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the hidden width, are sufficient to induce instability. To address this, we propose a simple, dimension-aware rescaling of Glorot that shifts the spectral radius slightly below one, preventing rapid signal explosion or decay. These results suggest that standard initialization schemes may break down in the long-sequence regime, motivating a separate line of theory for stable recurrent initialization.</description>

We explore the extent to which taxonomies can be completed from a seed taxonomy or generated without a seed from a set of known concepts, in an iterative fashion using recent prompting techniques. Experiments on five taxonomies using an open-source LLM (Llama-3), while promising, point to the difficulty of correctly placing inner nodes.</description>

      <title>PCDCNet: A Surrogate Model for Air Quality Forecasting with Physical-Chemical Dynamics and Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air quality forecasting (AQF) is critical for public health and environmental management, yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay of emissions, meteorology, and chemical transformations. Traditional numerical models, such as CMAQ and WRF-Chem, provide physically grounded simulations but are computationally expensive and rely on uncertain emission inventories. Deep learning models, while computationally efficient, often struggle with generalization due to their lack of physical constraints. To bridge this gap, we propose PCDCNet, a surrogate model that integrates numerical modeling principles with deep learning. PCDCNet explicitly incorporates emissions, meteorological influences, and domain-informed constraints to model pollutant formation, transport, and dissipation. By combining graph-based spatial transport modeling, recurrent structures for temporal accumulation, and representation enhancement for local interactions, PCDCNet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in 72-hour station-level PM2.5 and O3 forecasting while significantly reducing computational costs. Furthermore, our model is deployed in an online platform, providing free, real-time air quality forecasts, demonstrating its scalability and societal impact. By aligning deep learning with physical consistency, PCDCNet offers a practical and interpretable solution for AQF, enabling informed decision-making for both personal and regulatory applications.</description>

      <title>DISCOVER: Automated Curricula for Sparse-Reward Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) can model a wide range of highly complex tasks. Solving sparse-reward tasks is RL's core premise - requiring efficient exploration coupled with long-horizon credit assignment - and overcoming these challenges is key for building self-improving agents with superhuman ability. We argue that solving complex and high-dimensional tasks requires solving simpler tasks that are relevant to the target task. In contrast, most prior work designs strategies for selecting exploratory tasks with the objective of solving any task, making exploration of challenging high-dimensional, long-horizon tasks intractable. We find that the sense of direction, necessary for effective exploration, can be extracted from existing RL algorithms, without needing any prior information. Based on this finding, we propose a method for directed sparse-reward goal-conditioned very long-horizon RL (DISCOVER), which selects exploratory goals in the direction of the target task. We connect DISCOVER to principled exploration in bandits, formally bounding the time until the target task becomes achievable in terms of the agent's initial distance to the target, but independent of the volume of the space of all tasks. Empirically, we perform a thorough evaluation in high-dimensional environments. We find that the directed goal selection of DISCOVER solves exploration problems that are beyond the reach of prior state-of-the-art exploration methods in RL.</description>

Abstract: Transliteration, the process of mapping text from one script to another, plays a crucial role in multilingual natural language processing, especially within linguistically diverse contexts such as India. Despite significant advancements through specialized models like IndicXlit, recent developments in large language models suggest a potential for general-purpose models to excel at this task without explicit task-specific training. The current work systematically evaluates the performance of prominent LLMs, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.5, GPT-4.1, Gemma-3-27B-it, and Mistral-Large against IndicXlit, a state-of-the-art transliteration model, across ten major Indian languages. Experiments utilized standard benchmarks, including Dakshina and Aksharantar datasets, with performance assessed via Top-1 Accuracy and Character Error Rate. Our findings reveal that while GPT family models generally outperform other LLMs and IndicXlit for most instances. Additionally, fine-tuning GPT-4o improves performance on specific languages notably. An extensive error analysis and robustness testing under noisy conditions further elucidate strengths of LLMs compared to specialized models, highlighting the efficacy of foundational models for a wide spectrum of specialized applications with minimal overhead.</description>

      <title>Two Causally Related Needles in a Video Haystack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the video understanding capabilities of Video-Language Models (VLMs) remains a significant challenge. We propose a long-context video understanding benchmark, Causal2Needles, that assesses two crucial abilities insufficiently evaluated by existing benchmarks: (1) the ability to extract information from two separate locations in a long video and understand them jointly, and (2) the ability to model the world in terms of cause and effect in human behaviors. Specifically, Causal2Needles introduces 2-needle questions, which require extracting information from both the cause and effect human-behavior events in a long video and the associated narration text. To prevent textual bias, these questions comprise two complementary formats: one asking to identify the video clip containing the answer, and one asking for the textual description of an unrelated visual detail from that video clip. Our experiments reveal that models excelling in pre-existing benchmarks struggle with 2-needle visual grounding, and the model performance is negatively correlated with the distance between the two needles. These findings highlight critical limitations in current VLMs.</description>

      <title>Deep Active Inference Agents for Delayed and Long-Horizon Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent success of world-model agents, which extend the core idea of model-based reinforcement learning by learning a differentiable model for sample-efficient control across diverse tasks, active inference (AIF) offers a complementary, neuroscience-grounded paradigm that unifies perception, learning, and action within a single probabilistic framework powered by a generative model. Despite this promise, practical AIF agents still rely on accurate immediate predictions and exhaustive planning, a limitation that is exacerbated in delayed environments requiring plans over long horizons, tens to hundreds of steps. Moreover, most existing agents are evaluated on robotic or vision benchmarks which, while natural for biological agents, fall short of real-world industrial complexity. We address these limitations with a generative-policy architecture featuring (i) a multi-step latent transition that lets the generative model predict an entire horizon in a single look-ahead, (ii) an integrated policy network that enables the transition and receives gradients of the expected free energy, (iii) an alternating optimization scheme that updates model and policy from a replay buffer, and (iv) a single gradient step that plans over long horizons, eliminating exhaustive planning from the control loop. We evaluate our agent in an environment that mimics a realistic industrial scenario with delayed and long-horizon settings. The empirical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating the coupled world-model with the AIF formalism yields an end-to-end probabilistic controller capable of effective decision making in delayed, long-horizon settings without handcrafted rewards or expensive planning.</description>

      <title>StyleAR: Customizing Multimodal Autoregressive Model for Style-Aligned Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current research landscape, multimodal autoregressive (AR) models have shown exceptional capabilities across various domains, including visual understanding and generation. However, complex tasks such as style-aligned text-to-image generation present significant challenges, particularly in data acquisition. In analogy to instruction-following tuning for image editing of AR models, style-aligned generation requires a reference style image and prompt, resulting in a text-image-to-image triplet where the output shares the style and semantics of the input. However, acquiring large volumes of such triplet data with specific styles is considerably more challenging than obtaining conventional text-to-image data used for training generative models. To address this issue, we propose StyleAR, an innovative approach that combines a specially designed data curation method with our proposed AR models to effectively utilize text-to-image binary data for style-aligned text-to-image generation. Our method synthesizes target stylized data using a reference style image and prompt, but only incorporates the target stylized image as the image modality to create high-quality binary data. To facilitate binary data training, we introduce a CLIP image encoder with a perceiver resampler that translates the image input into style tokens aligned with multimodal tokens in AR models and implement a style-enhanced token technique to prevent content leakage which is a common issue in previous work. Furthermore, we mix raw images drawn from large-scale text-image datasets with stylized images to enhance StyleAR's ability to extract richer stylistic features and ensure style consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate our superior performance.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing Obfuscation: A four-dimensional framework for evaluating Large Language Models assembly code deobfuscation capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in software engineering, yet their effectiveness for binary analysis remains unexplored. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of commercial LLMs for assembly code deobfuscation. Testing seven state-of-the-art models against four obfuscation scenarios (bogus control flow, instruction substitution, control flow flattening, and their combination), we found striking performance variations--from autonomous deobfuscation to complete failure. We propose a theoretical framework based on four dimensions: Reasoning Depth, Pattern Recognition, Noise Filtering, and Context Integration, explaining these variations. Our analysis identifies five error patterns: predicate misinterpretation, structural mapping errors, control flow misinterpretation, arithmetic transformation errors, and constant propagation errors, revealing fundamental limitations in LLM code processing.We establish a three-tier resistance model: bogus control flow (low resistance), control flow flattening (moderate resistance), and instruction substitution/combined techniques (high resistance). Universal failure against combined techniques demonstrates that sophisticated obfuscation remains effective against advanced LLMs. Our findings suggest a human-AI collaboration paradigm where LLMs reduce expertise barriers for certain reverse engineering tasks while requiring human guidance for complex deobfuscation. This work provides a foundation for evaluating emerging capabilities and developing resistant obfuscation techniques.x deobfuscation.

      <title>APE: A Data-Centric Benchmark for Efficient LLM Adaptation in Text Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Adjacent Possible Exploration (APE), a simple yet effective method for adapting large language models to specific tasks using minimal computational resources. Unlike traditional fine-tuning that requires extensive compute, APE iteratively fine-tunes models on small, carefully selected data batches (200 examples), retaining only improvements. On news summarization, APE achieves 40 percent BLEU improvement using just a T4 GPU in 60 minutes, matching or exceeding more complex methods like LoRA while remaining conceptually simple. Our approach is particularly valuable for researchers and practitioners with limited computational resources. We provide open-source code and demonstrate APE's effectiveness through both automatic metrics and human evaluation. While inspired by evolutionary theory's "adjacent possible", APE's core insight has a very practical application: small, iterative data perturbations can efficiently guide LLMs toward task-specific performance without expensive retraining.</description>

      <title>Enigmata: Scaling Logical Reasoning in Large Language Models with Synthetic Verifiable Puzzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1, excel at advanced reasoning tasks like math and coding via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), but still struggle with puzzles solvable by humans without domain knowledge. We introduce Enigmata, the first comprehensive suite tailored for improving LLMs with puzzle reasoning skills. It includes 36 tasks across seven categories, each with 1) a generator that produces unlimited examples with controllable difficulty and 2) a rule-based verifier for automatic evaluation. This generator-verifier design supports scalable, multi-task RL training, fine-grained analysis, and seamless RLVR integration. We further propose Enigmata-Eval, a rigorous benchmark, and develop optimized multi-task RLVR strategies. Our trained model, Qwen2.5-32B-Enigmata, consistently surpasses o3-mini-high and o1 on the puzzle reasoning benchmarks like Enigmata-Eval, ARC-AGI (32.8%), and ARC-AGI 2 (0.6%). It also generalizes well to out-of-domain puzzle benchmarks and mathematical reasoning, with little multi-tasking trade-off. When trained on larger models like Seed1.5-Thinking (20B activated parameters and 200B total parameters), puzzle data from Enigmata further boosts SoTA performance on advanced math and STEM reasoning tasks such as AIME (2024-2025), BeyondAIME and GPQA (Diamond), showing nice generalization benefits of Enigmata. This work offers a unified, controllable framework for advancing logical reasoning in LLMs. Resources of this work can be found at https://seed-enigmata.github.io.</description>

      <title>Evaluating AI cyber capabilities with crowdsourced elicitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly capable, understanding their offensive cyber potential is critical for informed governance and responsible deployment. However, it's hard to accurately bound their capabilities, and some prior evaluations dramatically underestimated them. The art of extracting maximum task-specific performance from AIs is called "AI elicitation", and today's safety organizations typically conduct it in-house. In this paper, we explore crowdsourcing elicitation efforts as an alternative to in-house elicitation work.
  We host open-access AI tracks at two Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions: AI vs. Humans (400 teams) and Cyber Apocalypse_ (4000 teams). The AI teams achieve outstanding performance at both events, ranking top-13% and top-21% respectively for a total of \$7500 in bounties. This impressive performance suggests that open-market elicitation may offer an effective complement to in-house elicitation. We propose elicitation bounties as a practical mechanism for maintaining timely, cost-effective situational awareness of emerging AI capabilities.
  Another advantage of open elicitations is the option to collect human performance data at scale. Applying METR's methodology, we found that AI agents can reliably solve cyber challenges requiring one hour or less of effort from a median human CTF participant.</description>

      <title>A Responsible Face Recognition Approach for Small and Mid-Scale Systems Through Personalized Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional face recognition systems rely on extracting fixed face representations, known as templates, to store and verify identities. These representations are typically generated by neural networks that often lack explainability and raise concerns regarding fairness and privacy. In this work, we propose a novel model-template (MOTE) approach that replaces vector-based face templates with small personalized neural networks. This design enables more responsible face recognition for small and medium-scale systems. During enrollment, MOTE creates a dedicated binary classifier for each identity, trained to determine whether an input face matches the enrolled identity. Each classifier is trained using only a single reference sample, along with synthetically balanced samples to allow adjusting fairness at the level of a single individual during enrollment. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and recognition systems demonstrate substantial improvements in fairness and particularly in privacy. Although the method increases inference time and storage requirements, it presents a strong solution for small- and mid-scale applications where fairness and privacy are critical.</description>

      <title>Can Visual Encoder Learn to See Arrows?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diagram is a visual representation of a relationship illustrated with edges (lines or arrows), which is widely used in industrial and scientific communication. Although recognizing diagrams is essential for vision language models (VLMs) to comprehend domain-specific knowledge, recent studies reveal that many VLMs fail to identify edges in images. We hypothesize that these failures stem from an over-reliance on textual and positional biases, preventing VLMs from learning explicit edge features. Based on this idea, we empirically investigate whether the image encoder in VLMs can learn edge representation through training on a diagram dataset in which edges are biased neither by textual nor positional information. To this end, we conduct contrastive learning on an artificially generated diagram--caption dataset to train an image encoder and evaluate its diagram-related features on three tasks: probing, image retrieval, and captioning. Our results show that the finetuned model outperforms pretrained CLIP in all tasks and surpasses zero-shot GPT-4o and LLaVA-Mistral in the captioning task. These findings confirm that eliminating textual and positional biases fosters accurate edge recognition in VLMs, offering a promising path for advancing diagram understanding.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Learned Test-Time Model Routing in Language Model Zoos with Service Level Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-weight LLM zoos provide access to numerous high-quality models, but selecting the appropriate model for specific tasks remains challenging and requires technical expertise. Most users simply want factually correct, safe, and satisfying responses without concerning themselves with model technicalities, while inference service providers prioritize minimizing operating costs. These competing interests are typically mediated through service level agreements (SLAs) that guarantee minimum service quality. We introduce MESS+, a stochastic optimization algorithm for cost-optimal LLM request routing while providing rigorous SLA compliance guarantees. MESS+ learns request satisfaction probabilities of LLMs in real-time as users interact with the system, based on which model selection decisions are made by solving a per-request optimization problem. Our algorithm includes a novel combination of virtual queues and request satisfaction prediction, along with a theoretical analysis of cost optimality and constraint satisfaction. Across a wide range of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, MESS+ achieves an average of 2x cost savings compared to existing LLM routing techniques.</description>

      <title>SaSi: A Self-augmented and Self-interpreted Deep Learning Approach for Few-shot Cryo-ET Particle Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a powerful technique for imaging macromolecular complexes in their near-native states. However, the localization of 3D particles in cellular environments still presents a significant challenge due to low signal-to-noise ratios and missing wedge artifacts. Deep learning approaches have shown great potential, but they need huge amounts of data, which can be a challenge in cryo-ET scenarios where labeled data is often scarce. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-augmented and Self-interpreted (SaSi) deep learning approach towards few-shot particle detection in 3D cryo-ET images. Our method builds upon self-augmentation techniques to further boost data utilization and introduces a self-interpreted segmentation strategy for alleviating dependency on labeled data, hence improving generalization and robustness. As demonstrated by experiments conducted on both simulated and real-world cryo-ET datasets, the SaSi approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for particle localization. This research increases understanding of how to detect particles with very few labels in cryo-ET and thus sets a new benchmark for few-shot learning in structural biology.</description>

      <title>Novel Loss-Enhanced Universal Adversarial Patches for Sustainable Speaker Privacy</title>

Abstract: Deep learning voice models are commonly used nowadays, but the safety processing of personal data, such as human identity and speech content, remains suspicious. To prevent malicious user identification, speaker anonymization methods were proposed. Current methods, particularly based on universal adversarial patch (UAP) applications, have drawbacks such as significant degradation of audio quality, decreased speech recognition quality, low transferability across different voice biometrics models, and performance dependence on the input audio length. To mitigate these drawbacks, in this work, we introduce and leverage the novel Exponential Total Variance (TV) loss function and provide experimental evidence that it positively affects UAP strength and imperceptibility. Moreover, we present a novel scalable UAP insertion procedure and demonstrate its uniformly high performance for various audio lengths.</description>

      <title>MLR-Bench: Evaluating AI Agents on Open-Ended Machine Learning Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in AI agents have demonstrated their growing potential to drive and support scientific discovery. In this work, we introduce MLR-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI agents on open-ended machine learning research. MLR-Bench includes three key components: (1) 201 research tasks sourced from NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML workshops covering diverse ML topics; (2) MLR-Judge, an automated evaluation framework combining LLM-based reviewers with carefully designed review rubrics to assess research quality; and (3) MLR-Agent, a modular agent scaffold capable of completing research tasks through four stages: idea generation, proposal formulation, experimentation, and paper writing. Our framework supports both stepwise assessment across these distinct research stages, and end-to-end evaluation of the final research paper. We then use MLR-Bench to evaluate six frontier LLMs and an advanced coding agent, finding that while LLMs are effective at generating coherent ideas and well-structured papers, current coding agents frequently (e.g., in 80% of the cases) produce fabricated or invalidated experimental results--posing a major barrier to scientific reliability. We validate MLR-Judge through human evaluation, showing high agreement with expert reviewers, supporting its potential as a scalable tool for research evaluation. We open-source MLR-Bench to help the community benchmark, diagnose, and improve AI research agents toward trustworthy and transparent scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Preference Data for Post-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in strengthening the capabilities of large language models has stemmed from applying reinforcement learning to domains with automatically verifiable outcomes. A key question is whether we can similarly use RL to optimize for outcomes in domains where evaluating outcomes inherently requires human feedback; for example, in tasks like deep research and trip planning, outcome evaluation is qualitative and there are many possible degrees of success. One attractive and scalable modality for collecting human feedback is preference data: ordinal rankings (pairwise or $k$-wise) that indicate, for $k$ given outcomes, which one is preferred. In this work, we study a critical roadblock: preference data fundamentally and significantly limits outcome-based optimization. Even with idealized preference data (infinite, noiseless, and online), the use of ordinal feedback can prevent obtaining even approximately optimal solutions. We formalize this impossibility using voting theory, drawing an analogy between how a model chooses to answer a query with how voters choose a candidate to elect. This indicates that grounded human scoring and algorithmic innovations are necessary for extending the success of RL post-training to domains demanding human feedback. We also explore why these limitations have disproportionately impacted RLHF when it comes to eliciting reasoning behaviors (e.g., backtracking) versus situations where RLHF has been historically successful (e.g., instruction-tuning and safety training), finding that the limitations of preference data primarily suppress RLHF's ability to elicit robust strategies -- a class that encompasses most reasoning behaviors.</description>

      <title>Learning to Select In-Context Demonstration Preferred by Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks during inference using only a few demonstrations. However, ICL performance is highly dependent on the selection of these demonstrations. Recent work explores retrieval-based methods for selecting query-specific demonstrations, but these approaches often rely on surrogate objectives such as metric learning, failing to directly optimize ICL performance. Consequently, they struggle to identify truly beneficial demonstrations. Moreover, their discriminative retrieval paradigm is ineffective when the candidate pool lacks sufficient high-quality demonstrations. To address these challenges, we propose GenICL, a novel generative preference learning framework that leverages LLM feedback to directly optimize demonstration selection for ICL. Experiments on 19 datasets across 11 task categories demonstrate that GenICL achieves superior performance than existing methods in selecting the most effective demonstrations, leading to better ICL performance.</description>

      <title>DFIR-Metric: A Benchmark Dataset for Evaluating Large Language Models in Digital Forensics and Incident Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) involves analyzing digital evidence to support legal investigations. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities in DFIR tasks such as log analysis and memory forensics, but their susceptibility to errors and hallucinations raises concerns in high-stakes contexts. Despite growing interest, there is no comprehensive benchmark to evaluate LLMs across both theoretical and practical DFIR domains. To address this gap, we present DFIR-Metric, a benchmark with three components: (1) Knowledge Assessment: a set of 700 expert-reviewed multiple-choice questions sourced from industry-standard certifications and official documentation; (2) Realistic Forensic Challenges: 150 CTF-style tasks testing multi-step reasoning and evidence correlation; and (3) Practical Analysis: 500 disk and memory forensics cases from the NIST Computer Forensics Tool Testing Program (CFTT). We evaluated 14 LLMs using DFIR-Metric, analyzing both their accuracy and consistency across trials. We also introduce a new metric, the Task Understanding Score (TUS), designed to more effectively evaluate models in scenarios where they achieve near-zero accuracy. This benchmark offers a rigorous, reproducible foundation for advancing AI in digital forensics. All scripts, artifacts, and results are available on the project website at https://github.com/DFIR-Metric.</description>

      <title>ICDM: Interference Cancellation Diffusion Models for Wireless Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently achieved significant success in wireless communications systems due to their denoising capabilities. The broadcast nature of wireless signals makes them susceptible not only to Gaussian noise, but also to unaware interference. This raises the question of whether DMs can effectively mitigate interference in wireless semantic communication systems. In this paper, we model the interference cancellation problem as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem over the joint posterior probability of the signal and interference, and theoretically prove that the solution provides excellent estimates for the signal and interference. To solve this problem, we develop an interference cancellation diffusion model (ICDM), which decomposes the joint posterior into independent prior probabilities of the signal and interference, along with the channel transition probablity. The log-gradients of these distributions at each time step are learned separately by DMs and accurately estimated through deriving. ICDM further integrates these gradients with advanced numerical iteration method, achieving accurate and rapid interference cancellation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICDM significantly reduces the mean square error (MSE) and enhances perceptual quality compared to schemes without ICDM. For example, on the CelebA dataset under the Rayleigh fading channel with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $20$ dB and signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of 0 dB, ICDM reduces the MSE by 4.54 dB and improves the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) by 2.47 dB.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Complex Visual Comprehension into Atomic Visual Skills for Vision Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal comprehension and reasoning capabilities, yet they often struggle with trivially simple visual tasks. In this work, we focus on the domain of basic 2D Euclidean geometry and systematically categorize the fundamental, indivisible visual perception skills, which we refer to as atomic visual skills. We then introduce the Atomic Visual Skills Dataset (AVSD) for evaluating VLMs on the atomic visual skills. Using AVSD, we benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs and find that they struggle with these tasks, despite being trivial for adult humans. Our findings highlight the need for purpose-built datasets to train and evaluate VLMs on atomic, rather than composite, visual perception tasks.</description>

      <title>ReasonPlan: Unified Scene Prediction and Decision Reasoning for Closed-loop Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the powerful vision-language reasoning and generalization abilities, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered significant attention in the field of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving. However, their application to closed-loop systems remains underexplored, and current MLLM-based methods have not shown clear superiority to mainstream E2E imitation learning approaches. In this work, we propose ReasonPlan, a novel MLLM fine-tuning framework designed for closed-loop driving through holistic reasoning with a self-supervised Next Scene Prediction task and supervised Decision Chain-of-Thought process. This dual mechanism encourages the model to align visual representations with actionable driving context, while promoting interpretable and causally grounded decision making. We curate a planning-oriented decision reasoning dataset, namely PDR, comprising 210k diverse and high-quality samples. Our method outperforms the mainstream E2E imitation learning method by a large margin of 19% L2 and 16.1 driving score on Bench2Drive benchmark. Furthermore, ReasonPlan demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on unseen DOS benchmark, highlighting its adaptability in handling zero-shot corner cases. Code and dataset will be found in https://github.com/Liuxueyi/ReasonPlan.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Gradient Inversion Transcript (GIT), a novel generative approach for reconstructing training data from leaked gradients. GIT employs a generative attack model, whose architecture is tailored to align with the structure of the leaked model based on theoretical analysis. Once trained offline, GIT can be deployed efficiently and only relies on the leaked gradients to reconstruct the input data, rendering it applicable under various distributed learning environments. When used as a prior for other iterative optimization-based methods, GIT not only accelerates convergence but also enhances the overall reconstruction quality. GIT consistently outperforms existing methods across multiple datasets and demonstrates strong robustness under challenging conditions, including inaccurate gradients, data distribution shifts and discrepancies in model parameters.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal brain encoding models for multi-modal stimuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite participants engaging in unimodal stimuli, such as watching images or silent videos, recent work has demonstrated that multi-modal Transformer models can predict visual brain activity impressively well, even with incongruent modality representations. This raises the question of how accurately these multi-modal models can predict brain activity when participants are engaged in multi-modal stimuli. As these models grow increasingly popular, their use in studying neural activity provides insights into how our brains respond to such multi-modal naturalistic stimuli, i.e., where it separates and integrates information across modalities through a hierarchy of early sensory regions to higher cognition. We investigate this question by using multiple unimodal and two types of multi-modal models-cross-modal and jointly pretrained-to determine which type of model is more relevant to fMRI brain activity when participants are engaged in watching movies. We observe that both types of multi-modal models show improved alignment in several language and visual regions. This study also helps in identifying which brain regions process unimodal versus multi-modal information. We further investigate the contribution of each modality to multi-modal alignment by carefully removing unimodal features one by one from multi-modal representations, and find that there is additional information beyond the unimodal embeddings that is processed in the visual and language regions. Based on this investigation, we find that while for cross-modal models, their brain alignment is partially attributed to the video modality; for jointly pretrained models, it is partially attributed to both the video and audio modalities. This serves as a strong motivation for the neuroscience community to investigate the interpretability of these models for deepening our understanding of multi-modal information processing in brain.</description>

      <title>Correlating instruction-tuning (in multimodal models) with vision-language processing (in the brain)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based language models, though not explicitly trained to mimic brain recordings, have demonstrated surprising alignment with brain activity. Progress in these models-through increased size, instruction-tuning, and multimodality-has led to better representational alignment with neural data. Recently, a new class of instruction-tuned multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have emerged, showing remarkable zero-shot capabilities in open-ended multimodal vision tasks. However, it is unknown whether MLLMs, when prompted with natural instructions, lead to better brain alignment and effectively capture instruction-specific representations. To address this, we first investigate brain alignment, i.e., measuring the degree of predictivity of neural visual activity using text output response embeddings from MLLMs as participants engage in watching natural scenes. Experiments with 10 different instructions show that MLLMs exhibit significantly better brain alignment than vision-only models and perform comparably to non-instruction-tuned multimodal models like CLIP. We also find that while these MLLMs are effective at generating high-quality responses suitable to the task-specific instructions, not all instructions are relevant for brain alignment. Further, by varying instructions, we make the MLLMs encode instruction-specific visual concepts related to the input image. This analysis shows that MLLMs effectively capture count-related and recognition-related concepts, demonstrating strong alignment with brain activity. Notably, the majority of the explained variance of the brain encoding models is shared between MLLM embeddings of image captioning and other instructions. These results suggest that enhancing MLLMs' ability to capture task-specific information could lead to better differentiation between various types of instructions, and thereby improving their precision in predicting brain responses.</description>

Abstract: We observe a novel 'multiple-descent' phenomenon during the training process of LSTM, in which the test loss goes through long cycles of up and down trend multiple times after the model is overtrained. By carrying out asymptotic stability analysis of the models, we found that the cycles in test loss are closely associated with the phase transition process between order and chaos, and the local optimal epochs are consistently at the critical transition point between the two phases. More importantly, the global optimal epoch occurs at the first transition from order to chaos, where the 'width' of the 'edge of chaos' is the widest, allowing the best exploration of better weight configurations for learning.</description>

      <title>EmoNet-Face: An Expert-Annotated Benchmark for Synthetic Emotion Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective human-AI interaction relies on AI's ability to accurately perceive and interpret human emotions. Current benchmarks for vision and vision-language models are severely limited, offering a narrow emotional spectrum that overlooks nuanced states (e.g., bitterness, intoxication) and fails to distinguish subtle differences between related feelings (e.g., shame vs. embarrassment). Existing datasets also often use uncontrolled imagery with occluded faces and lack demographic diversity, risking significant bias. To address these critical gaps, we introduce EmoNet Face, a comprehensive benchmark suite. EmoNet Face features: (1) A novel 40-category emotion taxonomy, meticulously derived from foundational research to capture finer details of human emotional experiences. (2) Three large-scale, AI-generated datasets (EmoNet HQ, Binary, and Big) with explicit, full-face expressions and controlled demographic balance across ethnicity, age, and gender. (3) Rigorous, multi-expert annotations for training and high-fidelity evaluation. (4) We build Empathic Insight Face, a model achieving human-expert-level performance on our benchmark. The publicly released EmoNet Face suite - taxonomy, datasets, and model - provides a robust foundation for developing and evaluating AI systems with a deeper understanding of human emotions.</description>

      <title>Grammars of Formal Uncertainty: When to Trust LLMs in Automated Reasoning Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show remarkable promise for democratizing automated reasoning by generating formal specifications. However, a fundamental tension exists: LLMs are probabilistic, while formal verification demands deterministic guarantees. This paper addresses this epistemological gap by comprehensively investigating failure modes and uncertainty quantification (UQ) in LLM-generated formal artifacts. Our systematic evaluation of five frontier LLMs reveals Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) based autoformalization's domain-specific impact on accuracy (from +34.8% on logical tasks to -44.5% on factual ones), with known UQ techniques like the entropy of token probabilities failing to identify these errors. We introduce a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) framework to model LLM outputs, yielding a refined uncertainty taxonomy. We find uncertainty signals are task-dependent (e.g., grammar entropy for logic, AUROC&gt;0.93). Finally, a lightweight fusion of these signals enables selective verification, drastically reducing errors (14-100%) with minimal abstention, transforming LLM-driven formalization into a reliable engineering discipline.</description>

      <title>Multimodal LLM-Guided Semantic Correction in Text-to-Image Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become the mainstream architecture for text-to-image generation, achieving remarkable progress in visual quality and prompt controllability. However, current inference pipelines generally lack interpretable semantic supervision and correction mechanisms throughout the denoising process. Most existing approaches rely solely on post-hoc scoring of the final image, prompt filtering, or heuristic resampling strategies-making them ineffective in providing actionable guidance for correcting the generative trajectory. As a result, models often suffer from object confusion, spatial errors, inaccurate counts, and missing semantic elements, severely compromising prompt-image alignment and image quality. To tackle these challenges, we propose MLLM Semantic-Corrected Ping-Pong-Ahead Diffusion (PPAD), a novel framework that, for the first time, introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a semantic observer during inference. PPAD performs real-time analysis on intermediate generations, identifies latent semantic inconsistencies, and translates feedback into controllable signals that actively guide the remaining denoising steps. The framework supports both inference-only and training-enhanced settings, and performs semantic correction at only extremely few diffusion steps, offering strong generality and scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPAD's significant improvements.</description>

      <title>SAEs Are Good for Steering -- If You Select the Right Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been proposed as an unsupervised approach to learn a decomposition of a model's latent space. This enables useful applications such as steering - influencing the output of a model towards a desired concept - without requiring labeled data. Current methods identify SAE features to steer by analyzing the input tokens that activate them. However, recent work has highlighted that activations alone do not fully describe the effect of a feature on the model's output. In this work, we draw a distinction between two types of features: input features, which mainly capture patterns in the model's input, and output features, which have a human-understandable effect on the model's output. We propose input and output scores to characterize and locate these types of features, and show that high values for both scores rarely co-occur in the same features. These findings have practical implications: after filtering out features with low output scores, we obtain 2-3x improvements when steering with SAEs, making them competitive with supervised methods.</description>

      <title>SafeDPO: A Simple Approach to Direct Preference Optimization with Enhanced Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance and find applications across a growing number of fields, ensuring the safety of LLMs has become increasingly critical. To address safety concerns, recent studies have proposed integrating safety constraints into Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, these approaches tend to be complex, as they encompass complicated procedures in RLHF along with additional steps required by the safety constraints. Inspired by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), we introduce a new algorithm called SafeDPO, which is designed to directly optimize the safety alignment objective in a single stage of policy learning, without requiring relaxation. SafeDPO introduces only one additional hyperparameter to further enhance safety and requires only minor modifications to standard DPO. As a result, it eliminates the need to fit separate reward and cost models or to sample from the language model during fine-tuning, while still enhancing the safety of LLMs. Finally, we demonstrate that SafeDPO achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art safety alignment algorithms, both in terms of aligning with human preferences and improving safety.</description>

      <title>Automated data curation for self-supervised learning in underwater acoustic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sustainability of the ocean ecosystem is threatened by increased levels of sound pollution, making monitoring crucial to understand its variability and impact. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems collect a large amount of underwater sound recordings, but the large volume of data makes manual analysis impossible, creating the need for automation. Although machine learning offers a potential solution, most underwater acoustic recordings are unlabeled. Self-supervised learning models have demonstrated success in learning from large-scale unlabeled data in various domains like computer vision, Natural Language Processing, and audio. However, these models require large, diverse, and balanced datasets for training in order to generalize well. To address this, a fully automated self-supervised data curation pipeline is proposed to create a diverse and balanced dataset from raw PAM data. It integrates Automatic Identification System (AIS) data with recordings from various hydrophones in the U.S. waters. Using hierarchical k-means clustering, the raw audio data is sampled and then combined with AIS samples to create a balanced and diverse dataset. The resulting curated dataset enables the development of self-supervised learning models, facilitating various tasks such as monitoring marine mammals and assessing sound pollution.</description>

      <title>Community Moderation and the New Epistemology of Fact Checking on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms have traditionally relied on internal moderation teams and partnerships with independent fact-checking organizations to identify and flag misleading content. Recently, however, platforms including X (formerly Twitter) and Meta have shifted towards community-driven content moderation by launching their own versions of crowd-sourced fact-checking -- Community Notes. If effectively scaled and governed, such crowd-checking initiatives have the potential to combat misinformation with increased scale and speed as successfully as community-driven efforts once did with spam. Nevertheless, general content moderation, especially for misinformation, is inherently more complex. Public perceptions of truth are often shaped by personal biases, political leanings, and cultural contexts, complicating consensus on what constitutes misleading content. This suggests that community efforts, while valuable, cannot replace the indispensable role of professional fact-checkers. Here we systemically examine the current approaches to misinformation detection across major platforms, explore the emerging role of community-driven moderation, and critically evaluate both the promises and challenges of crowd-checking at scale.</description>

      <title>On the Same Page: Dimensions of Perceived Shared Understanding in Human-AI Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shared understanding plays a key role in the effective communication in and performance of human-human interactions. With the increasingly common integration of AI into human contexts, the future of personal and workplace interactions will likely see human-AI interaction (HAII) in which the perception of shared understanding is important. Existing literature has addressed the processes and effects of PSU in human-human interactions, but the construal remains underexplored in HAII. To better understand PSU in HAII, we conducted an online survey to collect user reflections on interactions with a large language model when it sunderstanding of a situation was thought to be similar to or different from the participant's. Through inductive thematic analysis, we identified eight dimensions comprising PSU in human-AI interactions: Fluency, aligned operation, fluidity, outcome satisfaction, contextual awareness, lack of humanlike abilities, computational limits, and suspicion.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing Reasoning from Weak Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on reasoning-intensive tasks, but enhancing their reasoning abilities typically relies on either reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable signals or supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) demonstrations, both of which are expensive. In this paper, we study a novel problem of incentivizing the reasoning capacity of LLMs without expensive high-quality demonstrations and reinforcement learning. We investigate whether the reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be effectively incentivized via supervision from significantly weaker models. We further analyze when and why such weak supervision succeeds in eliciting reasoning abilities in stronger models. Our findings show that supervision from significantly weaker reasoners can substantially improve student reasoning performance, recovering close to 94% of the gains of expensive RL at a fraction of the cost. Experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures demonstrate that weak reasoners can effectively incentivize reasoning in stronger student models, consistently improving performance across a wide range of reasoning tasks. Our results suggest that this simple weak-to-strong paradigm is a promising and generalizable alternative to costly methods for incentivizing strong reasoning capabilities at inference-time in LLMs. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/yuanyige/W2SR.</description>

      <title>Inference-time Alignment in Continuous Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models with human feedback at inference time has received increasing attention due to its flexibility. Existing methods rely on generating multiple responses from the base policy for search using a reward model, which can be considered as searching in a discrete response space. However, these methods struggle to explore informative candidates when the base policy is weak or the candidate set is small, resulting in limited effectiveness. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose Simple Energy Adaptation ($\textbf{SEA}$), a simple yet effective algorithm for inference-time alignment. In contrast to expensive search over the discrete space, SEA directly adapts original responses from the base policy toward the optimal one via gradient-based sampling in continuous latent space. Specifically, SEA formulates inference as an iterative optimization procedure on an energy function over actions in the continuous space defined by the optimal policy, enabling simple and effective alignment. For instance, despite its simplicity, SEA outperforms the second-best baseline with a relative improvement of up to $ \textbf{77.51%}$ on AdvBench and $\textbf{16.36%}$ on MATH. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/yuanyige/SEA</description>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the major technological advancements of this century, bearing incredible potential for users through AI-powered applications and tools in numerous domains. Being often black-box (i.e., its decision-making process is unintelligible), developers typically resort to eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to interpret the behaviour of AI models to produce systems that are transparent, fair, reliable, and trustworthy. However, presenting explanations to the user is not trivial and is often left as a secondary aspect of the system's design process, leading to AI systems that are not useful to end-users. This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review on Explanation User Interfaces (XUIs) to gain a deeper understanding of the solutions and design guidelines employed in the academic literature to effectively present explanations to users. To improve the contribution and real-world impact of this survey, we also present a framework for Human-cEnteRed developMent of Explainable user interfaceS (HERMES) to guide practitioners and academics in the design and evaluation of XUIs.</description>

      <title>Homophily Enhanced Graph Domain Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) transfers knowledge from labeled source graphs to unlabeled target graphs, addressing the challenge of label scarcity. In this paper, we highlight the significance of graph homophily, a pivotal factor for graph domain alignment, which, however, has long been overlooked in existing approaches. Specifically, our analysis first reveals that homophily discrepancies exist in benchmarks. Moreover, we also show that homophily discrepancies degrade GDA performance from both empirical and theoretical aspects, which further underscores the importance of homophily alignment in GDA. Inspired by this finding, we propose a novel homophily alignment algorithm that employs mixed filters to smooth graph signals, thereby effectively capturing and mitigating homophily discrepancies between graphs. Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>MA-RAG: Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Collaborative Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MA-RAG, a Multi-Agent framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that addresses the inherent ambiguities and reasoning challenges in complex information-seeking tasks. Unlike conventional RAG methods that rely on either end-to-end fine-tuning or isolated component enhancements, MA-RAG orchestrates a collaborative set of specialized AI agents: Planner, Step Definer, Extractor, and QA Agents, to tackle each stage of the RAG pipeline with task-aware reasoning. Ambiguities may arise from underspecified queries, sparse or indirect evidence in retrieved documents, or the need to integrate information scattered across multiple sources. MA-RAG mitigates these challenges by decomposing the problem into subtasks, such as query disambiguation, evidence extraction, and answer synthesis, and dispatching them to dedicated agents equipped with chain-of-thought prompting. These agents communicate intermediate reasoning and progressively refine the retrieval and synthesis process. Our design allows fine-grained control over information flow without any model fine-tuning. Crucially, agents are invoked on demand, enabling a dynamic and efficient workflow that avoids unnecessary computation. This modular and reasoning-driven architecture enables MA-RAG to deliver robust, interpretable results. Experiments on multi-hop and ambiguous QA benchmarks demonstrate that MA-RAG outperforms state-of-the-art training-free baselines and rivals fine-tuned systems, validating the effectiveness of collaborative agent-based reasoning in RAG.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Meet Knowledge Graphs for Question Answering: Synthesis and Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on question-answering (QA) tasks because of their superior capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, LLM-based QA struggles with complex QA tasks due to poor reasoning capacity, outdated knowledge, and hallucinations. Several recent works synthesize LLMs and knowledge graphs (KGs) for QA to address the above challenges. In this survey, we propose a new structured taxonomy that categorizes the methodology of synthesizing LLMs and KGs for QA according to the categories of QA and the KG's role when integrating with LLMs. We systematically survey state-of-the-art advances in synthesizing LLMs and KGs for QA and compare and analyze these approaches in terms of strength, limitations, and KG requirements. We then align the approaches with QA and discuss how these approaches address the main challenges of different complex QA. Finally, we summarize the advancements, evaluation metrics, and benchmark datasets and highlight open challenges and opportunities.</description>

      <title>AdaTP: Attention-Debiased Token Pruning for Video Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in video understanding tasks. However, they often suffer from heavy computational overhead due to the large number of visual tokens generated from multiple video frames. Existing visual token compression methods often rely on attention scores from language models as guidance. However, these scores exhibit inherent biases: global bias reflects a tendency to focus on the two ends of the visual token sequence, while local bias leads to an over-concentration on the same spatial positions across different frames. To address the issue of attention bias, we propose $\textbf{A}$ttention-$\textbf{D}$ebi$\textbf{a}$sed $\textbf{T}$oken $\textbf{P}$runing for Video Large Language Models ($\textbf{AdaTP}$), a novel token pruning pipeline for Video LLMs. AdaTP integrates two dedicated debiasing modules into the pipeline, targeting global attention bias and local attention bias, respectively. Without the need for additional training, our method significantly reduces the computational overhead of Video LLMs while retaining the performance of vanilla models. Extensive evaluation shows that AdaTP achieves state-of-the-art performance in various commonly used video understanding benchmarks. In particular, on LLaVA-OneVision-7B, AdaTP maintains performance without degradation while using only up to $27.3\%$ FLOPs compared to the vanilla model. Our code will be released soon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suicidal risk detection in adolescents is a critical challenge, yet existing methods rely on language-specific models, limiting scalability and generalization. This study introduces a novel language-agnostic framework for suicidal risk assessment with large language models (LLMs). We generate Chinese transcripts from speech using an ASR model and then employ LLMs with prompt-based queries to extract suicidal risk-related features from these transcripts. The extracted features are retained in both Chinese and English to enable cross-linguistic analysis and then used to fine-tune corresponding pretrained language models independently. Experimental results show that our method achieves performance comparable to direct fine-tuning with ASR results or to models trained solely on Chinese suicidal risk-related features, demonstrating its potential to overcome language constraints and improve the robustness of suicidal risk assessment.</description>

      <title>Proxy-Free GFlowNet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are a promising class of generative models designed to sample diverse, high-reward structures by modeling distributions over compositional objects. In many real-world applications, obtaining the reward function for such objects is expensive, time-consuming, or requires human input, making it necessary to train GFlowNets from historical datasets. Most existing methods adopt a model-based approach, learning a proxy model from the dataset to approximate the reward function. However, this strategy inherently ties the quality of the learned policy to the accuracy of the proxy, introducing additional complexity and uncertainty into the training process. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{Trajectory-Distilled GFlowNet (TD-GFN)}, a \emph{proxy-free} training framework that eliminates the need for out-of-dataset reward queries. Our method is motivated by the key observation that different edges in the associated directed acyclic graph (DAG) contribute unequally to effective policy learning. TD-GFN leverages inverse reinforcement learning to estimate edge-level rewards from the offline dataset, which are then used to ingeniously prune the DAG and guide backward trajectory sampling during training. This approach directs the policy toward high-reward regions while reducing the complexity of model fitting. Empirical results across multiple tasks show that TD-GFN trains both efficiently and reliably, significantly outperforming existing baselines in convergence speed and sample quality.</description>

      <title>ResSVD: Residual Compensated SVD for Large Language Model Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in a wide range of downstream natural language processing tasks. Nevertheless, their considerable sizes and memory demands hinder practical deployment, underscoring the importance of developing efficient compression strategies. Singular value decomposition (SVD) decomposes a matrix into orthogonal components, enabling efficient low-rank approximation. This is particularly suitable for LLM compression, where weight matrices often exhibit significant redundancy. However, current SVD-based methods neglect the residual matrix from truncation, resulting in significant truncation loss. Additionally, compressing all layers of the model results in severe performance degradation. To overcome these limitations, we propose ResSVD, a new post-training SVD-based LLM compression method. Specifically, we leverage the residual matrix generated during the truncation process to reduce truncation loss. Moreover, under a fixed overall compression ratio, we selectively compress the last few layers of the model, which mitigates error propagation and significantly improves the performance of compressed models.Comprehensive evaluations of ResSVD on diverse LLM families and multiple benchmark datasets indicate that ResSVD consistently achieves superior performance over existing counterpart methods, demonstrating its practical effectiveness.</description>

Abstract: The increased digitization of world's textual heritage poses significant challenges for both computer science and literary studies. Overall, there is an urgent need of computational techniques able to adapt to the challenges of historical texts, such as orthographic and spelling variations, fragmentary structure and digitization errors. The rise of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, suggesting promising applications for Named Entity Recognition (NER) on historical documents. In spite of this, no thorough evaluation has been proposed for Italian texts. This research tries to fill the gap by proposing a new challenging dataset for entity extraction based on a corpus of 19th century scholarly notes, i.e. Giacomo Leopardi's Zibaldone (1898), containing 2,899 references to people, locations and literary works. This dataset was used to carry out reproducible experiments with both domain-specific BERT-based models and state-of-the-art LLMs such as LLaMa3.1. Results show that instruction-tuned models encounter multiple difficulties handling historical humanistic texts, while fine-tuned NER models offer more robust performance even with challenging entity types such as bibliographic references.</description>

      <title>Tensorization is a powerful but underexplored tool for compression and interpretability of neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensorizing a neural network involves reshaping some or all of its dense weight matrices into higher-order tensors and approximating them using low-rank tensor network decompositions. This technique has shown promise as a model compression strategy for large-scale neural networks. However, despite encouraging empirical results, tensorized neural networks (TNNs) remain underutilized in mainstream deep learning. In this position paper, we offer a perspective on both the potential and current limitations of TNNs. We argue that TNNs represent a powerful yet underexplored framework for deep learning--one that deserves greater attention from both engineering and theoretical communities. Beyond compression, we highlight the value of TNNs as a flexible class of architectures with distinctive scaling properties and increased interpretability. A central feature of TNNs is the presence of bond indices, which introduce new latent spaces not found in conventional networks. These internal representations may provide deeper insight into the evolution of features across layers, potentially advancing the goals of mechanistic interpretability. We conclude by outlining several key research directions aimed at overcoming the practical barriers to scaling and adopting TNNs in modern deep learning workflows.</description>

      <title>Error Optimization: Overcoming Exponential Signal Decay in Deep Predictive Coding Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive Coding (PC) offers a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation for neural network training, yet struggles with deeper architectures. This paper identifies the root cause: an inherent signal decay problem where gradients attenuate exponentially with depth, becoming computationally negligible due to numerical precision constraints. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce Error Optimization (EO), a novel reparameterization that preserves PC's theoretical properties while eliminating signal decay. By optimizing over prediction errors rather than states, EO enables signals to reach all layers simultaneously and without attenuation, converging orders of magnitude faster than standard PC. Experiments across multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate that EO matches backpropagation's performance even for deeper models where conventional PC struggles. Besides practical improvements, our work provides theoretical insight into PC dynamics and establishes a foundation for scaling biologically-inspired learning to deeper architectures on digital hardware and beyond.</description>

      <title>StructEval: Benchmarking LLMs' Capabilities to Generate Structural Outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to software development workflows, their ability to generate structured outputs has become critically important. We introduce StructEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capabilities in producing both non-renderable (JSON, YAML, CSV) and renderable (HTML, React, SVG) structured formats. Unlike prior benchmarks, StructEval systematically evaluates structural fidelity across diverse formats through two paradigms: 1) generation tasks, producing structured output from natural language prompts, and 2) conversion tasks, translating between structured formats. Our benchmark encompasses 18 formats and 44 types of task, with novel metrics for format adherence and structural correctness. Results reveal significant performance gaps, even state-of-the-art models like o1-mini achieve only 75.58 average score, with open-source alternatives lagging approximately 10 points behind. We find generation tasks more challenging than conversion tasks, and producing correct visual content more difficult than generating text-only structures.</description>

      <title>Improvement Strategies for Few-Shot Learning in OCT Image Classification of Rare Retinal Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on using few-shot learning to improve the accuracy of classifying OCT diagnosis images with major and rare classes. We used the GAN-based augmentation strategy as a baseline and introduced several novel methods to further enhance our model. The proposed strategy contains U-GAT-IT for improving the generative part and uses the data balance technique to narrow down the skew of accuracy between all categories. The best model obtained was built with CBAM attention mechanism and fine-tuned InceptionV3, and achieved an overall accuracy of 97.85%, representing a significant improvement over the original baseline.</description>

      <title>On the (Non) Injectivity of Piecewise Linear Janossy Pooling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiset functions, which are functions that map multisets to vectors, are a fundamental tool in the construction of neural networks for multisets and graphs. To guarantee that the vector representation of the multiset is faithful, it is often desirable to have multiset mappings that are both injective and bi-Lipschitz. Currently, there are several constructions of multiset functions achieving both these guarantees, leading to improved performance in some tasks but often also to higher compute time than standard constructions. Accordingly, it is natural to inquire whether simpler multiset functions achieving the same guarantees are available. In this paper, we make a large step towards giving a negative answer to this question. We consider the family of k-ary Janossy pooling, which includes many of the most popular multiset models, and prove that no piecewise linear Janossy pooling function can be injective. On the positive side, we show that when restricted to multisets without multiplicities, even simple deep-sets models suffice for injectivity and bi-Lipschitzness.</description>

      <title>Hard Negative Contrastive Learning for Fine-Grained Geometric Understanding in Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benefiting from contrastively trained visual encoders on large-scale natural scene images, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various visual perception tasks. However, the inherent limitations of contrastive learning upon summarized descriptions fundamentally restrict the capabilities of models in meticulous reasoning, particularly in crucial scenarios of geometric problem-solving. To enhance geometric understanding, we propose a novel hard negative contrastive learning framework for the vision encoder, which combines image-based contrastive learning using generation-based hard negatives created by perturbing diagram generation code, and text-based contrastive learning using rule-based negatives derived from modified geometric descriptions and retrieval-based negatives selected based on caption similarity. We train CLIP using our strong negative learning method, namely MMCLIP (Multimodal Math CLIP), and subsequently train an LMM for geometric problem-solving. Experiments show that our trained model, MMGeoLM, significantly outperforms other open-source models on three geometric reasoning benchmarks. Even with a size of 7B, it can rival powerful closed-source models like GPT-4o. We further study the impact of different negative sample construction methods and the number of negative samples on the geometric reasoning performance of LMM, yielding fruitful conclusions. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/THU-KEG/MMGeoLM.</description>

      <title>Prismatic Synthesis: Gradient-based Data Diversification Boosts Generalization in LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective generalization in language models depends critically on the diversity of their training data. Yet existing diversity metrics often fall short of this goal, relying on surface-level heuristics that are decoupled from model behavior. This motivates us to ask: What kind of diversity in training data actually drives generalization in language models -- and how can we measure and amplify it? Through large-scale empirical analyses spanning over 300 training runs, carefully controlled for data scale and quality, we show that data diversity can be a strong predictor of generalization in LLM reasoning -- as measured by average model performance on unseen out-of-distribution benchmarks. We introduce G-Vendi, a metric that quantifies diversity via the entropy of model-induced gradients. Despite using a small off-the-shelf proxy model for gradients, G-Vendi consistently outperforms alternative measures, achieving strong correlation (Spearman's $\rho \approx 0.9$) with out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on both natural language inference (NLI) and math reasoning tasks. Building on this insight, we present Prismatic Synthesis, a framework for generating diverse synthetic data by targeting underrepresented regions in gradient space. Experimental results show that Prismatic Synthesis consistently improves model performance as we scale synthetic data -- not just on in-distribution test but across unseen, out-of-distribution benchmarks -- significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models that rely on 20 times larger data generator than ours. For example, PrismMath-7B, our model distilled from a 32B LLM, outperforms R1-Distill-Qwen-7B -- the same base model trained on proprietary data generated by 671B R1 -- on 6 out of 7 challenging benchmarks.</description>

      <title>From Alignment to Advancement: Bootstrapping Audio-Language Alignment with Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) have recently made great strides in understanding and processing audio inputs. These models are typically adapted from text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on audio-related tasks. However, this adaptation process presents two major limitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where important textual capabilities such as instruction-following are lost after training on audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that are not present in the input audio, raising concerns about their reliability. Second, achieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically relies on large collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for instruction tuning, making the process resource-intensive. To address these issues, we leverage the backbone LLMs from ALLMs to synthesize general-purpose caption-style alignment data. We refer to this process as bootstrapping audio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs (BALSa). Building on BALSa, we introduce LISTEN (Learning to Identify Sounds Through Extended Negative Samples), a contrastive-like training method designed to improve ALLMs' ability to distinguish between present and absent sounds. We further extend BALSa to multi-audio scenarios, where the model either explains the differences between audio inputs or produces a unified caption that describes them all, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. Experimental results indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations while reliably maintaining strong performance in audio understanding, reasoning, and instruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating multi-audio training further enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning capabilities. Overall, BALSa offers an efficient and scalable approach to the development of ALLMs.</description>

      <title>THiNK: Can Large Language Models Think-aloud?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing higher-order thinking skills in large language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge, especially in tasks that go beyond surface-level accuracy. In this work, we propose THiNK (Testing Higher-order Notion of Knowledge), a multi-agent, feedback-driven evaluation framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy. THiNK frames reasoning assessment as an iterative task of problem generation, critique, and revision, encouraging LLMs to think-aloud through step-by-step reflection and refinement. This enables a systematic evaluation of both lower-order (e.g., remember, understand) and higher-order (e.g., evaluate, create) thinking skills. We apply THiNK to seven state-of-the-art LLMs and perform a detailed cognitive analysis of their outputs. Results reveal that while models reliably perform lower-order categories well, they struggle with applying knowledge in realistic contexts and exhibit limited abstraction. Structured feedback loops significantly improve reasoning performance, particularly in higher-order thinking. Qualitative evaluations further confirm that THiNK-guided outputs better align with domain logic and problem structure. The code of our framework provides a scalable methodology for probing and enhancing LLM reasoning, offering new directions for evaluation grounded in learning science, which is available at our GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Descriptions of Emotional Preferences in Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The affective attitude of liking a recommended item reflects just one category in a wide spectrum of affective phenomena that also includes emotions such as entranced or intrigued, moods such as cheerful or buoyant, as well as more fine-grained affective states, such as "pleasantly surprised by the conclusion". In this paper, we introduce a novel recommendation task that can leverage a virtually unbounded range of affective states sought explicitly by the user in order to identify items that, upon consumption, are likely to induce those affective states. Correspondingly, we create a large dataset of user preferences containing expressions of fine-grained affective states that are mined from book reviews, and propose a Transformer-based architecture that leverages such affective expressions as input. We then use the resulting dataset of affective states preferences, together with the linked users and their histories of book readings, ratings, and reviews, to train and evaluate multiple recommendation models on the task of matching recommended items with affective preferences. Experiments show that the best results are obtained by models that can utilize textual descriptions of items and user affective preferences.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models for Code Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Code reviews are crucial for software quality. Recent AI advances have allowed large language models (LLMs) to review and fix code; now, there are tools that perform these reviews. However, their reliability and accuracy have not yet been systematically evaluated. Objective: This study compares different LLMs' performance in detecting code correctness and suggesting improvements. Method: We tested GPT4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash on 492 AI generated code blocks of varying correctness, along with 164 canonical code blocks from the HumanEval benchmark. To simulate the code review task objectively, we expected LLMs to assess code correctness and improve the code if needed. We ran experiments with different configurations and reported on the results. Results: With problem descriptions, GPT4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash correctly classified code correctness 68.50% and 63.89% of the time, respectively, and corrected the code 67.83% and 54.26% of the time for the 492 code blocks of varying correctness. Without problem descriptions, performance declined. The results for the 164 canonical code blocks differed, suggesting that performance depends on the type of code. Conclusion: LLM code reviews can help suggest improvements and assess correctness, but there is a risk of faulty outputs. We propose a process that involves humans, called the "Human in the loop LLM Code Review" to promote knowledge sharing while mitigating the risk of faulty outputs.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Column Space Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with minimal computational overhead is essential for efficiently adapting them to downstream tasks under resource constraints. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), facilitate this by updating only a small subset of parameters. However, recent studies show that LoRA diverges from full fine-tuning (Full FT) in its learning behavior, particularly in terms of spectral properties. Motivated by these findings, we propose PiCa, the first theoretically grounded PEFT method based on the spectral properties of fine-tuned weights. PiCa projects gradients onto the low-rank column subspace of pre-trained weights and exhibits learning patterns more closely aligned with Full FT. Furthermore, we show that combining PiCa with weight sharing drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters without compromising performance, enabling to achieve superior performance than LoRA using 13x fewer trainable parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate PiCa achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared to existing PEFT methods.</description>

      <title>From What to How: Attributing CLIP's Latent Components Reveals Unexpected Semantic Reliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based CLIP models are widely used for text-image probing and feature extraction, making it relevant to understand the internal mechanisms behind their predictions. While recent works show that Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) yield interpretable latent components, they focus on what these encode and miss how they drive predictions. We introduce a scalable framework that reveals what latent components activate for, how they align with expected semantics, and how important they are to predictions. To achieve this, we adapt attribution patching for instance-wise component attributions in CLIP and highlight key faithfulness limitations of the widely used Logit Lens technique. By combining attributions with semantic alignment scores, we can automatically uncover reliance on components that encode semantically unexpected or spurious concepts. Applied across multiple CLIP variants, our method uncovers hundreds of surprising components linked to polysemous words, compound nouns, visual typography and dataset artifacts. While text embeddings remain prone to semantic ambiguity, they are more robust to spurious correlations compared to linear classifiers trained on image embeddings. A case study on skin lesion detection highlights how such classifiers can amplify hidden shortcuts, underscoring the need for holistic, mechanistic interpretability.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern deep learning models generalize remarkably well in-distribution, despite being overparametrized and trained with little to no explicit regularization. Instead, current theory credits implicit regularization imposed by the choice of architecture, hyperparameters and optimization procedure. However, deploying deep learning models out-of-distribution, in sequential decision-making tasks, or in safety-critical domains, necessitates reliable uncertainty quantification, not just a point estimate. The machinery of modern approximate inference -- Bayesian deep learning -- should answer the need for uncertainty quantification, but its effectiveness has been challenged by our inability to define useful explicit inductive biases through priors, as well as the associated computational burden. Instead, in this work we demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, how to regularize a variational deep network implicitly via the optimization procedure, just as for standard deep learning. We fully characterize the inductive bias of (stochastic) gradient descent in the case of an overparametrized linear model as generalized variational inference and demonstrate the importance of the choice of parametrization. Finally, we show empirically that our approach achieves strong in- and out-of-distribution performance without tuning of additional hyperparameters and with minimal time and memory overhead over standard deep learning.</description>

      <title>DreamPRM: Domain-Reweighted Process Reward Model for Multimodal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning has substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complicated tasks. Central to the current reasoning studies, Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer a fine-grained evaluation of intermediate reasoning steps and guide the reasoning process. However, extending PRMs to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces challenges. Since multimodal reasoning covers a wider range of tasks compared to text-only scenarios, the resulting distribution shift from the training to testing sets is more severe, leading to greater generalization difficulty. Training a reliable multimodal PRM, therefore, demands large and diverse datasets to ensure sufficient coverage. However, current multimodal reasoning datasets suffer from a marked quality imbalance, which degrades PRM performance and highlights the need for an effective data selection strategy. To address the issues, we introduce DreamPRM, a domain-reweighted training framework for multimodal PRMs which employs bi-level optimization. In the lower-level optimization, DreamPRM performs fine-tuning on multiple datasets with domain weights, allowing the PRM to prioritize high-quality reasoning signals and alleviating the impact of dataset quality imbalance. In the upper-level optimization, the PRM is evaluated on a separate meta-learning dataset; this feedback updates the domain weights through an aggregation loss function, thereby improving the generalization capability of trained PRM. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks covering both mathematical and general reasoning show that test-time scaling with DreamPRM consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art MLLMs. Further comparisons reveal that DreamPRM's domain-reweighting strategy surpasses other data selection methods and yields higher accuracy gains than existing test-time scaling approaches.</description>

      <title>KnowTrace: Bootstrapping Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Structured Knowledge Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) furnish large language models (LLMs) with iterative retrievals of relevant information to handle complex multi-hop questions. These methods typically alternate between LLM reasoning and retrieval to accumulate external information into the LLM's context. However, the ever-growing context inherently imposes an increasing burden on the LLM to perceive connections among critical information pieces, with futile reasoning steps further exacerbating this overload issue. In this paper, we present KnowTrace, an elegant RAG framework to (1) mitigate the context overload and (2) bootstrap higher-quality multi-step reasoning. Instead of simply piling the retrieved contents, KnowTrace autonomously traces out desired knowledge triplets to organize a specific knowledge graph relevant to the input question. Such a structured workflow not only empowers the LLM with an intelligible context for inference, but also naturally inspires a reflective mechanism of knowledge backtracing to identify contributive LLM generations as process supervision data for self-bootstrapping. Extensive experiments show that KnowTrace consistently surpasses existing methods across three multi-hop question answering benchmarks, and the bootstrapped version further amplifies the gains.</description>

      <title>WXImpactBench: A Disruptive Weather Impact Understanding Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change adaptation requires the understanding of disruptive weather impacts on society, where large language models (LLMs) might be applicable. However, their effectiveness is under-explored due to the difficulty of high-quality corpus collection and the lack of available benchmarks. The climate-related events stored in regional newspapers record how communities adapted and recovered from disasters. However, the processing of the original corpus is non-trivial. In this study, we first develop a disruptive weather impact dataset with a four-stage well-crafted construction pipeline. Then, we propose WXImpactBench, the first benchmark for evaluating the capacity of LLMs on disruptive weather impacts. The benchmark involves two evaluation tasks, multi-label classification and ranking-based question answering. Extensive experiments on evaluating a set of LLMs provide first-hand analysis of the challenges in developing disruptive weather impact understanding and climate change adaptation systems. The constructed dataset and the code for the evaluation framework are available to help society protect against vulnerabilities from disasters.</description>

      <title>Position: Mechanistic Interpretability Should Prioritize Feature Consistency in SAEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are a prominent tool in mechanistic interpretability (MI) for decomposing neural network activations into interpretable features. However, the aspiration to identify a canonical set of features is challenged by the observed inconsistency of learned SAE features across different training runs, undermining the reliability and efficiency of MI research. This position paper argues that mechanistic interpretability should prioritize feature consistency in SAEs -- the reliable convergence to equivalent feature sets across independent runs. We propose using the Pairwise Dictionary Mean Correlation Coefficient (PW-MCC) as a practical metric to operationalize consistency and demonstrate that high levels are achievable (0.80 for TopK SAEs on LLM activations) with appropriate architectural choices. Our contributions include detailing the benefits of prioritizing consistency; providing theoretical grounding and synthetic validation using a model organism, which verifies PW-MCC as a reliable proxy for ground-truth recovery; and extending these findings to real-world LLM data, where high feature consistency strongly correlates with the semantic similarity of learned feature explanations. We call for a community-wide shift towards systematically measuring feature consistency to foster robust cumulative progress in MI.</description>

      <title>Lifelong Safety Alignment for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs have made impressive progress, but their growing capabilities also expose them to highly flexible jailbreaking attacks designed to bypass safety alignment. While many existing defenses focus on known types of attacks, it is more critical to prepare LLMs for unseen attacks that may arise during deployment. To address this, we propose a lifelong safety alignment framework that enables LLMs to continuously adapt to new and evolving jailbreaking strategies. Our framework introduces a competitive setup between two components: a Meta-Attacker, trained to actively discover novel jailbreaking strategies, and a Defender, trained to resist them. To effectively warm up the Meta-Attacker, we first leverage the GPT-4o API to extract key insights from a large collection of jailbreak-related research papers. Through iterative training, the first iteration Meta-Attacker achieves a 73% attack success rate (ASR) on RR and a 57% transfer ASR on LAT using only single-turn attacks. Meanwhile, the Defender progressively improves its robustness and ultimately reduces the Meta-Attacker's success rate to just 7%, enabling safer and more reliable deployment of LLMs in open-ended environments. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/LifelongSafetyAlignment.</description>

      <title>Outcome-Based Online Reinforcement Learning: Algorithms and Fundamental Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with outcome-based feedback faces a fundamental challenge: when rewards are only observed at trajectory endpoints, how do we assign credit to the right actions? This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of this problem in online RL with general function approximation. We develop a provably sample-efficient algorithm achieving $\widetilde{O}({C_{\rm cov} H^3}/{\epsilon^2})$ sample complexity, where $C_{\rm cov}$ is the coverability coefficient of the underlying MDP. By leveraging general function approximation, our approach works effectively in large or infinite state spaces where tabular methods fail, requiring only that value functions and reward functions can be represented by appropriate function classes. Our results also characterize when outcome-based feedback is statistically separated from per-step rewards, revealing an unavoidable exponential separation for certain MDPs. For deterministic MDPs, we show how to eliminate the completeness assumption, dramatically simplifying the algorithm. We further extend our approach to preference-based feedback settings, proving that equivalent statistical efficiency can be achieved even under more limited information. Together, these results constitute a theoretical foundation for understanding the statistical properties of outcome-based reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Comparing Neural Network Encodings for Logic-based Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Providing explanations for the outputs of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is crucial in many contexts, such as critical systems, data protection laws and handling adversarial examples. Logic-based methods can offer explanations with correctness guarantees, but face scalability challenges. Due to these issues, it is necessary to compare different encodings of ANNs into logical constraints, which are used in logic-based explainability. This work compares two encodings of ANNs: one has been used in the literature to provide explanations, while the other will be adapted for our context of explainability. Additionally, the second encoding uses fewer variables and constraints, thus, potentially enhancing efficiency. Experiments showed similar running times for computing explanations, but the adapted encoding performed up to 18\% better in building logical constraints and up to 16\% better in overall time.</description>

      <title>In-Context Brush: Zero-shot Customized Subject Insertion with Context-Aware Latent Space Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enhanced multimodal-guided visual generation, enabling customized subject insertion that seamlessly "brushes" user-specified objects into a given image guided by textual prompts. However, existing methods often struggle to insert customized subjects with high fidelity and align results with the user's intent through textual prompts. In this work, we propose "In-Context Brush", a zero-shot framework for customized subject insertion by reformulating the task within the paradigm of in-context learning. Without loss of generality, we formulate the object image and the textual prompts as cross-modal demonstrations, and the target image with the masked region as the query. The goal is to inpaint the target image with the subject aligning textual prompts without model tuning. Building upon a pretrained MMDiT-based inpainting network, we perform test-time enhancement via dual-level latent space manipulation: intra-head "latent feature shifting" within each attention head that dynamically shifts attention outputs to reflect the desired subject semantics and inter-head "attention reweighting" across different heads that amplifies prompt controllability through differential attention prioritization. Extensive experiments and applications demonstrate that our approach achieves superior identity preservation, text alignment, and image quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, without requiring dedicated training or additional data collection.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Kernel Function for Fast Angle Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the angle testing problem in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces and propose two projection-based probabilistic kernel functions, one designed for angle comparison and the other for angle thresholding. Unlike existing approaches that rely on random projection vectors drawn from Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages reference angles and employs a deterministic structure for the projection vectors. Notably, our kernel functions do not require asymptotic assumptions, such as the number of projection vectors tending to infinity, and can be both theoretically and experimentally shown to outperform Gaussian-distribution-based kernel functions. We further apply the proposed kernel function to Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) and demonstrate that our approach achieves a 2.5X ~ 3X higher query-per-second (QPS) throughput compared to the state-of-the-art graph-based search algorithm HNSW.</description>

      <title>Does quantization affect models' performance on long-context tasks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now support context windows exceeding 128K tokens, but this comes with significant memory requirements and high inference latency. Quantization can mitigate these costs, but may degrade performance. In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of quantized LLMs on tasks with long-inputs (&gt;64K tokens) and long-form outputs. Our evaluation spans 9.7K test examples, five quantization methods (FP8, GPTQ-int8, AWQ-int4, GPTQ-int4, BNB-nf4), and five models (Llama-3.1 8B and 70B; Qwen-2.5 7B, 32B, and 72B). We find that, on average, 8-bit quantization preserves accuracy (~0.8% drop), whereas 4-bit methods lead to substantial losses, especially for tasks involving long context inputs (drops of up to 59%). This degradation tends to worsen when the input is in a language other than English. Crucially, the effects of quantization depend heavily on the quantization method, model, and task. For instance, while Qwen-2.5 72B remains robust under BNB-nf4, Llama-3.1 70B experiences a 32% performance drop on the same task. These findings highlight the importance of a careful, task-specific evaluation before deploying quantized LLMs, particularly in long-context scenarios and with languages other than English.</description>

      <title>The Coverage Principle: A Framework for Understanding Compositional Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models excel at pattern matching, yet often fall short in systematic compositional generalization. We propose the coverage principle: a data-centric framework showing that models relying primarily on pattern matching for compositional tasks cannot reliably generalize beyond substituting fragments that yield identical results when used in the same contexts. We demonstrate that this framework has a strong predictive power for the generalization capabilities of Transformers. First, we derive and empirically confirm that the training data required for two-hop generalization grows at least quadratically with the token set size, and the training data efficiency does not improve with 20x parameter scaling. Second, for compositional tasks with path ambiguity where one variable affects the output through multiple computational paths, we show that Transformers learn context-dependent state representations that undermine both performance and interoperability. Third, Chain-of-Thought supervision improves training data efficiency for multi-hop tasks but still struggles with path ambiguity. Finally, we outline a \emph{mechanism-based} taxonomy that distinguishes three ways neural networks can generalize: structure-based (bounded by coverage), property-based (leveraging algebraic invariances), and shared-operator (through function reuse). This conceptual lens contextualizes our results and highlights where new architectural ideas are needed to achieve systematic compositionally. Overall, the coverage principle provides a unified lens for understanding compositional reasoning, and underscores the need for fundamental architectural or training innovations to achieve truly systematic compositionality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent progress in general purpose robotics, robot policies still lag far behind basic human capabilities in the real world. Humans interact constantly with the physical world, yet this rich data resource remains largely untapped in robot learning. We propose EgoZero, a minimal system that learns robust manipulation policies from human demonstrations captured with Project Aria smart glasses, $\textbf{and zero robot data}$. EgoZero enables: (1) extraction of complete, robot-executable actions from in-the-wild, egocentric, human demonstrations, (2) compression of human visual observations into morphology-agnostic state representations, and (3) closed-loop policy learning that generalizes morphologically, spatially, and semantically. We deploy EgoZero policies on a gripper Franka Panda robot and demonstrate zero-shot transfer with 70% success rate over 7 manipulation tasks and only 20 minutes of data collection per task. Our results suggest that in-the-wild human data can serve as a scalable foundation for real-world robot learning - paving the way toward a future of abundant, diverse, and naturalistic training data for robots.

To establish the infrastructure for S2V generation, we propose OpenS2V-Nexus, consisting of (i) OpenS2V-Eval, a fine-grained benchmark, and (ii) OpenS2V-5M, a million-scale dataset. In contrast to existing S2V benchmarks inherited from VBench that focus on global and coarse-grained assessment of generated videos, OpenS2V-Eval focuses on the model's ability to generate subject-consistent videos with natural subject appearance and identity fidelity. For these purposes, OpenS2V-Eval introduces 180 prompts from seven major categories of S2V, which incorporate both real and synthetic test data. Furthermore, to accurately align human preferences with S2V benchmarks, we propose three automatic metrics, NexusScore, NaturalScore and GmeScore, to separately quantify subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos. Building on this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16 representative S2V models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses across different content. Moreover, we create the first open-source large-scale S2V generation dataset OpenS2V-5M, which consists of five million high-quality 720P subject-text-video triples. Specifically, we ensure subject-information diversity in our dataset by (1) segmenting subjects and building pairing information via cross-video associations and (2) prompting GPT-Image-1 on raw frames to synthesize multi-view representations. Through OpenS2V-Nexus, we deliver a robust infrastructure to accelerate future S2V generation research.</description>

      <title>GLEAM: Learning Generalizable Exploration Policy for Active Mapping in Complex 3D Indoor Scenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizable active mapping in complex unknown environments remains a critical challenge for mobile robots. Existing methods, constrained by insufficient training data and conservative exploration strategies, exhibit limited generalizability across scenes with diverse layouts and complex connectivity. To enable scalable training and reliable evaluation, we introduce GLEAM-Bench, the first large-scale benchmark designed for generalizable active mapping with 1,152 diverse 3D scenes from synthetic and real-scan datasets. Building upon this foundation, we propose GLEAM, a unified generalizable exploration policy for active mapping. Its superior generalizability comes mainly from our semantic representations, long-term navigable goals, and randomized strategies. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 66.50% coverage (+9.49%) with efficient trajectories and improved mapping accuracy on 128 unseen complex scenes.

      <title>Self-reflective Uncertainties: Do LLMs Know Their Internal Answer Distribution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To reveal when a large language model (LLM) is uncertain about a response, uncertainty quantification commonly produces percentage numbers along with the output. But is this all we can do? We argue that in the output space of LLMs, the space of strings, exist strings expressive enough to summarize the distribution over output strings the LLM deems possible. We lay a foundation for this new avenue of uncertainty explication and present SelfReflect, a theoretically-motivated metric to assess how faithfully a string summarizes an LLM's internal answer distribution. We show that SelfReflect is able to discriminate even subtle differences of candidate summary strings and that it aligns with human judgement, outperforming alternative metrics such as LLM judges and embedding comparisons. With SelfReflect, we investigate a number of self-summarization methods and find that even state-of-the-art reasoning models struggle to explicate their internal uncertainty. But we find that faithful summarizations can be generated by sampling and summarizing. Our metric enables future works towards this universal form of LLM uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Reasoning LLMs are Wandering Solution Explorers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities through test-time computation (TTC) techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting and tree-based reasoning. However, we argue that current reasoning LLMs (RLLMs) lack the ability to systematically explore the solution space. This paper formalizes what constitutes systematic problem solving and identifies common failure modes that reveal reasoning LLMs to be wanderers rather than systematic explorers. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, we uncover persistent issues: invalid reasoning steps, redundant explorations, hallucinated or unfaithful conclusions, and so on. Our findings suggest that current models' performance can appear to be competent on simple tasks yet degrade sharply as complexity increases. Based on the findings, we advocate for new metrics and tools that evaluate not just final outputs but the structure of the reasoning process itself.</description>

      <title>MangaVQA and MangaLMM: A Benchmark and Specialized Model for Multimodal Manga Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manga, or Japanese comics, is a richly multimodal narrative form that blends images and text in complex ways. Teaching large multimodal models (LMMs) to understand such narratives at a human-like level could help manga creators reflect on and refine their stories. To this end, we introduce two benchmarks for multimodal manga understanding: MangaOCR, which targets in-page text recognition, and MangaVQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate contextual understanding through visual question answering. MangaVQA consists of 526 high-quality, manually constructed question-answer pairs, enabling reliable evaluation across diverse narrative and visual scenarios. Building on these benchmarks, we develop MangaLMM, a manga-specialized model finetuned from the open-source LMM Qwen2.5-VL to jointly handle both tasks. Through extensive experiments, including comparisons with proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5, we assess how well LMMs understand manga. Our benchmark and model provide a comprehensive foundation for evaluating and advancing LMMs in the richly narrative domain of manga.</description>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing many areas of society. While this transformation has tremendous potential, there are several challenges as well. Using the history of computing and the world-wide web as a guide, in this paper we identify pitfalls and solutions that suggest how AI can be developed to its full potential.

      <description>arXiv:2305.02251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper surveys automated scientific discovery, from equation discovery and symbolic regression to autonomous discovery systems and agents. It discusses the individual approaches from a "big picture" perspective and in context, but also discusses open issues and recent topics like the various roles of deep neural networks in this area, aiding in the discovery of human-interpretable knowledge. Further, we will present closed-loop scientific discovery systems, starting with the pioneering work on the Adam system up to current efforts in fields from material science to astronomy. Finally, we will elaborate on autonomy from a machine learning perspective, but also in analogy to the autonomy levels in autonomous driving. The maximal level, level five, is defined to require no human intervention at all in the production of scientific knowledge. Achieving this is one step towards solving the Nobel Turing Grand Challenge to develop AI Scientists: AI systems capable of making Nobel-quality scientific discoveries highly autonomously at a level comparable, and possibly superior, to the best human scientists by 2050.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural revision seems so natural: it changes beliefs as little as possible to incorporate new information. Yet, some counterexamples show it wrong. It is so conservative that it never fully believes. It only believes in the current conditions. This is right in some cases and wrong in others. Which is which? The answer requires extending natural revision from simple formulae expressing universal truths (something holds) to conditionals expressing conditional truth (something holds in certain conditions). The extension is based on the basic principles natural revision follows, identified as minimal change and naivety: change mind as little as possible; believe what not contradicted. The extension says that natural revision restricts changes to the current conditions. A comparison with an unrestricting revision shows what exactly the current conditions are. It is not what currently considered true if it contradicts the new information. It includes something more and more unlikely until the new information is at least possible.</description>

      <title>Simplifying Complex Observation Models in Continuous POMDP Planning with Probabilistic Guarantees and Practice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07745v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with high dimensional and continuous observations, such as camera images, is required for many real life robotics and planning problems. Recent researches suggested machine learned probabilistic models as observation models, but their use is currently too computationally expensive for online deployment. We deal with the question of what would be the implication of using simplified observation models for planning, while retaining formal guarantees on the quality of the solution. Our main contribution is a novel probabilistic bound based on a statistical total variation distance of the simplified model. We show that it bounds the theoretical POMDP value w.r.t. original model, from the empirical planned value with the simplified model, by generalizing recent results of particle-belief MDP concentration bounds. Our calculations can be separated into offline and online parts, and we arrive at formal guarantees without having to access the costly model at all during planning, which is also a novel result. Finally, we demonstrate in simulation how to integrate the bound into the routine of an existing continuous online POMDP solver.</description>

      <title>Enabling Uncertainty Estimation in Iterative Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turning pass-through network architectures into iterative ones, which use their own output as input, is a well-known approach for boosting performance. In this paper, we argue that such architectures offer an additional benefit: The convergence rate of their successive outputs is highly correlated with the accuracy of the value to which they converge. Thus, we can use the convergence rate as a useful proxy for uncertainty. This results in an approach to uncertainty estimation that provides state-of-the-art estimates at a much lower computational cost than techniques like Ensembles, and without requiring any modifications to the original iterative model. We demonstrate its practical value by embedding it in two application domains: road detection in aerial images and the estimation of aerodynamic properties of 2D and 3D shapes.</description>

      <title>Unified Preference Optimization: Language Model Alignment Beyond the Preference Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17956v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For aligning large language models (LLMs), prior work has leveraged reinforcement learning via human feedback (RLHF) or variations of direct preference optimization (DPO). While DPO offers a simpler framework based on maximum likelihood estimation, it compromises on the ability to easily tune language models to maximize auxiliary, non-preferential objectives according to the LLM designer's preferences (e.g., tuning lexical style or minimizing specific kinds of harmful content). Critically, these designer objectives may not be amply human-labeled or represented in available data, align with user preferences, or even be able to be captured tractably by binary preference pairs. To leverage the simplicity and performance of DPO with the generality of RL, we propose a unified approach. Based on a simple decomposition of preference and auxiliary objectives, we allow for tuning LLMs to optimize user and designer preferences without any additional specialized or preference data, computational cost, stability ``tweaks'', or training instability. The proposed method, Unified Preference Optimization, shows the ability to effectively generalize to user preferences and auxiliary objectives, while preserving or surpassing alignment performance on challenging benchmarks across a range of model sizes.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Language Models with Neurally Compiled Libraries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Important tasks such as reasoning and planning are fundamentally algorithmic, meaning that solving them robustly requires acquiring true reasoning or planning algorithms, rather than shortcuts. Large Language Models lack true algorithmic ability primarily because of the limitations of neural network optimization algorithms, their optimization data and optimization objective, but also due to architectural inexpressivity. To solve this, our paper proposes augmenting LLMs with a library of fundamental operations and sophisticated differentiable programs, so that common algorithms do not need to be learned from scratch. We add memory, registers, basic operations, and adaptive recurrence to a transformer architecture built on LLaMA3. Then, we define a method for directly compiling algorithms into a differentiable starting library, which is used natively and propagates gradients for optimization. In this preliminary study, we explore the feasability of augmenting LLaMA3 with a differentiable computer, for instance by fine-tuning small transformers on simple algorithmic tasks with variable computational depth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empathetic response generation necessitates the integration of emotional and intentional dynamics to foster meaningful interactions. Existing research either neglects the intricate interplay between emotion and intent, leading to suboptimal controllability of empathy, or resorts to large language models (LLMs), which incur significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ReflectDiffu, a lightweight and comprehensive framework for empathetic response generation. This framework incorporates emotion contagion to augment emotional expressiveness and employs an emotion-reasoning mask to pinpoint critical emotional elements. Additionally, it integrates intent mimicry within reinforcement learning for refinement during diffusion. By harnessing an intent twice reflect mechanism of Exploring-Sampling-Correcting, ReflectDiffu adeptly translates emotional decision-making into precise intent actions, thereby addressing empathetic response misalignments stemming from emotional misrecognition. Through reflection, the framework maps emotional states to intents, markedly enhancing both response empathy and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ReflectDiffu outperforms existing models regarding relevance, controllability, and informativeness, achieving state-of-the-art results in both automatic and human evaluations.</description>

      <title>Many Heads Are Better Than One: Improved Scientific Idea Generation by A LLM-Based Multi-Agent System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of scientific progress requires innovative tools that can accelerate knowledge discovery. Although recent AI methods, particularly large language models (LLMs), have shown promise in tasks such as hypothesis generation and experimental design, they fall short of replicating the collaborative nature of real-world scientific practices, where diverse experts work together in teams to tackle complex problems. To address the limitations, we propose an LLM-based multi-agent system, i.e., Virtual Scientists (VirSci), designed to mimic the teamwork inherent in scientific research. VirSci organizes a team of agents to collaboratively generate, evaluate, and refine research ideas. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that this multi-agent approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method in producing novel scientific ideas. We further investigate the collaboration mechanisms that contribute to its tendency to produce ideas with higher novelty, offering valuable insights to guide future research and illuminating pathways toward building a robust system for autonomous scientific discovery. The code is available at https://github.com/open-sciencelab/Virtual-Scientists.</description>

      <title>AgentOccam: A Simple Yet Strong Baseline for LLM-Based Web Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomy via agents using large language models (LLMs) for personalized, standardized tasks boosts human efficiency. Automating web tasks (like booking hotels within a budget) is increasingly sought after. Fulfilling practical needs, the web agent also serves as an important proof-of-concept example for various agent grounding scenarios, with its success promising advancements in many future applications. Prior research often handcrafts web agent strategies (e.g., prompting templates, multi-agent systems, search methods, etc.) and the corresponding in-context examples, which may not generalize well across all real-world scenarios. On the other hand, there has been limited study on the misalignment between a web agent's observation/action representation and the pre-training data of the LLM it's based on. This discrepancy is especially notable when LLMs are primarily trained for language completion rather than tasks involving embodied navigation actions and symbolic web elements. Our study enhances an LLM-based web agent by simply refining its observation and action space to better align with the LLM's capabilities. This approach enables our base agent to significantly outperform previous methods on a wide variety of web tasks. Specifically, on WebArena, a benchmark featuring general-purpose web interaction tasks, our agent AgentOccam surpasses the previous state-of-the-art and concurrent work by 9.8 (+29.4%) and 5.9 (+15.8%) absolute points respectively, and boosts the success rate by 26.6 points (+161%) over similar plain web agents with its observation and action space alignment. We achieve this without using in-context examples, new agent roles, online feedback or search strategies. AgentOccam's simple design highlights LLMs' impressive zero-shot performance on web tasks, and underlines the critical role of carefully tuning observation and action spaces for LLM-based agents.</description>

      <title>LLMScan: Causal Scan for LLM Misbehavior Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16638v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various fields, their potential to generate untruthful, biased and harmful responses poses significant risks, particularly in critical applications. This highlights the urgent need for systematic methods to detect and prevent such misbehavior. While existing approaches target specific issues such as harmful responses, this work introduces LLMScan, an innovative LLM monitoring technique based on causality analysis, offering a comprehensive solution. LLMScan systematically monitors the inner workings of an LLM through the lens of causal inference, operating on the premise that the LLM's `brain' behaves differently when misbehaving. By analyzing the causal contributions of the LLM's input tokens and transformer layers, LLMScan effectively detects misbehavior. Extensive experiments across various tasks and models reveal clear distinctions in the causal distributions between normal behavior and misbehavior, enabling the development of accurate, lightweight detectors for a variety of misbehavior detection tasks.</description>

      <title>SaVe-TAG: Semantic-aware Vicinal Risk Minimization for Long-Tailed Text-Attributed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world graph data often follows long-tailed distributions, making it difficult for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generalize well across both head and tail classes. Recent advances in Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) have shown promise in mitigating class imbalance with numeric interpolation; however, existing approaches largely rely on embedding-space arithmetic, which fails to capture the rich semantics inherent in text-attributed graphs. In this work, we propose our method, SaVe-TAG (Semantic-aware Vicinal Risk Minimization for Long-Tailed Text-Attributed Graphs), a novel VRM framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform text-level interpolation, generating on-manifold, boundary-enriching synthetic samples for minority classes. To mitigate the risk of noisy generation, we introduce a confidence-based edge assignment mechanism that uses graph topology as a natural filter to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical justification for our method and conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, showing that our approach consistently outperforms both numeric interpolation and prior long-tailed node classification baselines. Our results highlight the importance of integrating semantic and structural signals for balanced and effective learning on text-attributed graphs.</description>

      <title>ChemToolAgent: The Impact of Tools on Language Agents for Chemistry Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To enhance large language models (LLMs) for chemistry problem solving, several LLM-based agents augmented with tools have been proposed, such as ChemCrow and Coscientist. However, their evaluations are narrow in scope, leaving a large gap in understanding the benefits of tools across diverse chemistry tasks. To bridge this gap, we develop ChemToolAgent, an enhanced chemistry agent over ChemCrow, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of its performance on both specialized chemistry tasks and general chemistry questions. Surprisingly, ChemToolAgent does not consistently outperform its base LLMs without tools. Our error analysis with a chemistry expert suggests that: For specialized chemistry tasks, such as synthesis prediction, we should augment agents with specialized tools; however, for general chemistry questions like those in exams, agents' ability to reason correctly with chemistry knowledge matters more, and tool augmentation does not always help.</description>

      <title>P$^2$ Law: Scaling Law for Post-Training After Model Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pruning has become a widely adopted technique for reducing the hardware requirements of large language models (LLMs). To recover model performance after pruning, post-training is commonly employed to mitigate the resulting performance degradation. While post-training benefits from larger datasets, once the dataset size is already substantial, increasing the training data provides only limited performance gains. To balance post-training cost and model performance, it is necessary to explore the optimal amount of post-training data.Through extensive experiments on the Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5 series models, pruned using various common pruning methods, we uncover the scaling \textbf{Law} for \textbf{P}ost-training after model \textbf{P}runing, referred to as the P$^2$ Law.This law identifies four key factors for predicting the pruned model's post-training loss: the model size before pruning, the number of post-training tokens, the pruning rate, and the model's loss before pruning. Moreover, P$^2$ Law can generalize to larger dataset sizes, larger model sizes, and higher pruning rates, offering valuable insights for the post-training of pruned LLMs.</description>

      <title>BPP-Search: Enhancing Tree of Thought Reasoning for Mathematical Modeling Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17404v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLMs exhibit advanced reasoning capabilities, offering the potential to transform natural language questions into mathematical models. However, existing open-source datasets in operations research domain lack detailed annotations of the modeling process, such as variable definitions, focusing solely on objective values, which hinders reinforcement learning applications. To address this, we release the StructuredOR dataset, annotated with comprehensive labels that capture the complete mathematical modeling process. We further propose BPP-Search, an algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning into a tree-of-thought structure using Beam search, a Process reward model, and a pairwise Preference algorithm. This approach enables efficient exploration of tree structures, avoiding exhaustive search while improving accuracy. Extensive experiments on StructuredOR, NL4OPT, and MAMO-ComplexLP datasets show that BPP-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In tree-based reasoning, BPP-Search excels in accuracy and efficiency, enabling faster retrieval of correct solutions. The StructuredOR dataset is available on Huggingface https://huggingface.co/datasets/LLM4OR/StructuredOR and GitHub https://github.com/LLM4OR/StructuredOR.</description>

      <title>Demonstration Selection for In-Context Learning via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diversity in demonstration selection is critical for enhancing model generalization by enabling broader coverage of structures and concepts. Constructing appropriate demonstration sets remains a key research challenge. This paper introduces the Relevance-Diversity Enhanced Selection (RDES), an innovative approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks to optimize the selection of diverse reference demonstrations for tasks amenable to in-context learning (ICL), particularly text classification and reasoning, in few-shot prompting scenarios. RDES employs frameworks like Q-learning and a PPO-based variant to dynamically identify demonstrations that maximize both diversity (quantified by label distribution) and relevance to the task objective. This strategy ensures a balanced representation of reference data, leading to improved accuracy and generalization. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, including diverse reasoning tasks, and involving 14 closed-source and open-source LLMs, we demonstrate that RDES significantly enhances performance compared to ten established baselines. Our evaluation includes analysis of performance across varying numbers of demonstrations on selected datasets. Furthermore, we investigate incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, which further boosts predictive performance. The results highlight the potential of RL for adaptive demonstration selection and addressing challenges in ICL.</description>

      <title>ProcessBench: Identifying Process Errors in Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06559v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As language models regularly make mistakes when solving math problems, automated identification of errors in the reasoning process becomes increasingly significant for their scalable oversight. In this paper, we introduce ProcessBench for measuring the ability to identify erroneous steps in mathematical reasoning. It consists of 3,400 test cases, primarily focused on competition- and Olympiad-level math problems. Each test case contains a step-by-step solution with error location annotated by human experts. Models are required to identify the earliest step that contains an error, or conclude that all steps are correct. We conduct extensive evaluation on ProcessBench, involving two types of models: process reward models (PRMs) and critic models, where for the latter we prompt general language models to critique each solution step by step. We draw two main observations: (1) Existing PRMs typically fail to generalize to more challenging math problems beyond GSM8K and MATH. They underperform both critic models (i.e., prompted general language models) and our own trained PRM that is straightforwardly fine-tuned on the PRM800K dataset. (2) The best open-source model, QwQ-32B-Preview, has demonstrated the critique capability competitive with the proprietary model GPT-4o, despite that it still lags behind the reasoning-specialized o1-mini. We hope ProcessBench can foster future research in reasoning process assessment, paving the way toward scalable oversight of language models.</description>

      <title>Better Think with Tables: Tabular Structures Enhance LLM Comprehension for Data-Analytics Requests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with data-analytics requests related to information retrieval and data manipulation that frequently arise in real-world scenarios under multiple conditions. In this paper, we introduce Thinking with Tables, where we inject tabular structures into LLMs for data-analytics requests. Through comprehensive evaluations across various request types, we show that providing tabular structures yields a 40.29 percent average performance gain along with better robustness and token efficiency. Through attention-value analysis, we uncover that tables help LLMs better attend to relevant information, explaining these improvements. Beyond tables and text, we evaluate whether (1) blending structuredness within text, such as providing templates or fixing the order of attributes, and (2) other representative structures, such as knowledge graphs and JSON, are helpful. We observe that utilizing tables offers the best balance between efficiency and effectiveness. These advantages remain consistent under increased task complexity and even when all input data cannot be structured. Finally, as data analytics typically relies on structured factual inputs, our text-to-table conversion demonstrates the method's applicability to text-compatible data sources.</description>

      <title>Facial Expression Analysis and Its Potentials in IoT Systems: A Contemporary Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Facial expressions convey human emotions and can be categorized into macro-expressions (MaEs) and micro-expressions (MiEs) based on duration and intensity. While MaEs are voluntary and easily recognized, MiEs are involuntary, rapid, and can reveal concealed emotions. The integration of facial expression analysis with Internet-of-Thing (IoT) systems has significant potential across diverse scenarios. IoT-enhanced MaE analysis enables real-time monitoring of patient emotions, facilitating improved mental health care in smart healthcare. Similarly, IoT-based MiE detection enhances surveillance accuracy and threat detection in smart security. Our work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of research progress in facial expression analysis and explores its potential integration with IoT systems. We discuss the distinctions between our work and existing surveys, elaborate on advancements in MaE and MiE analysis techniques across various learning paradigms, and examine their potential applications in IoT. We highlight challenges and future directions for the convergence of facial expression-based technologies and IoT systems, aiming to foster innovation in this domain. By presenting recent developments and practical applications, our work offers a systematic understanding of the ways of facial expression analysis to enhance IoT systems in healthcare, security, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Property Enhanced Instruction Tuning for Multi-task Molecule Generation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18084v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in various natural language processing tasks such as question answering and machine translation. However, due to the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of manual annotation for biochemical properties, the performance for molecule generation tasks is still limited, especially for tasks involving multi-properties constraints. In this work, we present a two-step framework PEIT (Property Enhanced Instruction Tuning) to improve LLMs for molecular-related tasks. In the first step, we use textual descriptions, SMILES, and biochemical properties as multimodal inputs to pre-train a model called PEIT-GEN, by aligning multi-modal representations to synthesize instruction data. In the second step, we fine-tune existing open-source LLMs with the synthesized data, the resulting PEIT-LLM can handle molecule captioning, text-based molecule generation, molecular property prediction, and our newly proposed multi-constraint molecule generation tasks. Experimental results show that our pre-trained PEIT-GEN outperforms MolT5 and BioT5 in molecule captioning, demonstrating modalities align well between textual descriptions, structures, and biochemical properties. Furthermore, PEIT-LLM shows promising improvements in multi-task molecule generation, proving the scalability of the PEIT framework for various molecular tasks. We release the code, constructed instruction data, and model checkpoints in https://github.com/chenlong164/PEIT.</description>

      <title>Value Compass Leaderboard: A Platform for Fundamental and Validated Evaluation of LLMs Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable breakthroughs, aligning their values with humans has become imperative for their responsible development and customized applications. However, there still lack evaluations of LLMs values that fulfill three desirable goals. (1) Value Clarification: We expect to clarify the underlying values of LLMs precisely and comprehensively, while current evaluations focus narrowly on safety risks such as bias and toxicity. (2) Evaluation Validity: Existing static, open-source benchmarks are prone to data contamination and quickly become obsolete as LLMs evolve. Additionally, these discriminative evaluations uncover LLMs' knowledge about values, rather than valid assessments of LLMs' behavioral conformity to values. (3) Value Pluralism: The pluralistic nature of human values across individuals and cultures is largely ignored in measuring LLMs value alignment. To address these challenges, we presents the Value Compass Leaderboard, with three correspondingly designed modules. It (i) grounds the evaluation on motivationally distinct \textit{basic values to clarify LLMs' underlying values from a holistic view; (ii) applies a \textit{generative evolving evaluation framework with adaptive test items for evolving LLMs and direct value recognition from behaviors in realistic scenarios; (iii) propose a metric that quantifies LLMs alignment with a specific value as a weighted sum over multiple dimensions, with weights determined by pluralistic values.</description>

      <title>PRESERVE: Prefetching Model Weights and KV-Cache in Distributed LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically served from clusters of GPUs/NPUs that consist of large number of devices. Unfortunately, communication between these devices incurs significant overhead, increasing the inference latency and cost while limiting the scalability. Prior work addressed this issue by overlapping communication with compute, but has severe limitations due to the data dependencies between these operations. In this paper, we propose PRESERVE, a novel framework that prefetches model weights and KV-cache from off-chip HBM memory to the on-chip cache of AI accelerators during the communication operations, which offers various advantages and performance improvements compared to prior methods.
  Through extensive experiments conducted on commercial AI accelerators, we demonstrate up to 1.6x end-to-end speedup on state-of-the-art, open-source LLMs. Additionally, we perform a design space exploration that identifies the optimal hardware configuration for the proposed method, showing a further 1.25x improvement in performance per cost by selecting the optimal L2 cache size. Our results show that PRESERVE has the potential to mitigate the memory bottlenecks and communication overheads, offering a solution to improve the performance and scalability of the LLM inference systems.</description>

      <title>SFT Memorizes, RL Generalizes: A Comparative Study of Foundation Model Post-training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used post-training techniques for foundation models. However, their roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain. Despite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the capability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal tasks.</description>

      <title>Understanding Multimodal LLMs Under Distribution Shifts: An Information-Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising capabilities but struggle under distribution shifts, where evaluation data differ from instruction tuning distributions. Although previous works have provided empirical evaluations, we argue that establishing a formal framework that can characterize and quantify the risk of MLLMs is necessary to ensure the safe and reliable application of MLLMs in the real world. By taking an information-theoretic perspective, we propose the first theoretical framework that enables the quantification of the maximum risk of MLLMs under distribution shifts. Central to our framework is the introduction of Effective Mutual Information (EMI), a principled metric that quantifies the relevance between input queries and model responses. We derive an upper bound for the EMI difference between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, connecting it to visual and textual distributional discrepancies. Extensive experiments on real benchmark datasets, spanning 61 shift scenarios, empirically validate our theoretical insights.</description>

Abstract: Quantitative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Benchmarks have emerged as fundamental tools for evaluating the performance, capability, and safety of AI models and systems. Currently, they shape the direction of AI development and are playing an increasingly prominent role in regulatory frameworks. As their influence grows, however, so too does concerns about how and with what effects they evaluate highly sensitive topics such as capabilities, including high-impact capabilities, safety and systemic risks. This paper presents an interdisciplinary meta-review of about 100 studies that discuss shortcomings in quantitative benchmarking practices, published in the last 10 years. It brings together many fine-grained issues in the design and application of benchmarks (such as biases in dataset creation, inadequate documentation, data contamination, and failures to distinguish signal from noise) with broader sociotechnical issues (such as an over-focus on evaluating text-based AI models according to one-time testing logic that fails to account for how AI models are increasingly multimodal and interact with humans and other technical systems). Our review also highlights a series of systemic flaws in current benchmarking practices, such as misaligned incentives, construct validity issues, unknown unknowns, and problems with the gaming of benchmark results. Furthermore, it underscores how benchmark practices are fundamentally shaped by cultural, commercial and competitive dynamics that often prioritise state-of-the-art performance at the expense of broader societal concerns. By providing an overview of risks associated with existing benchmarking procedures, we problematise disproportionate trust placed in benchmarks and contribute to ongoing efforts to improve the accountability and relevance of quantitative AI benchmarks within the complexities of real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>When More is Less: Understanding Chain-of-Thought Length in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to deconstruct complex problems. While longer CoTs are often presumed superior, this paper challenges that notion, arguing that longer is not always better. Drawing on combined evidence from real-world observations, controlled experiments, and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that task accuracy typically follows an inverted U-shaped curve with CoT length, where performance initially improves but eventually decreases as the number of CoT steps increases. With controlled experiments, we further uncover the scaling behaviors of the optimal CoT length: it increases with task difficulty but decreases with model capability, exposing an inherent simplicity bias where more capable models favor shorter, more efficient CoT reasoning. This bias is also evident in Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, where models gravitate towards shorter CoTs as their accuracy improves. To have a deep understanding of these dynamics, we establish a simple theoretical model that formally proves these phenomena, including the optimal length's scaling laws and the emergence of simplicity bias during RL. Guided by this framework, we demonstrate significant practical benefits from training with optimally-lengthed CoTs and employing length-aware filtering at inference. These findings offer both a principled understanding of the "overthinking" phenomenon and multiple practical guidelines for CoT calibration, enabling LLMs to achieve optimal reasoning performance with adaptive CoTs tailored to task complexity and model capability.</description>

      <title>Temporal Model On Quantum Logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a unified theoretical framework for modeling temporal memory dynamics, combining concepts from temporal logic, memory decay models, and hierarchical contexts. The framework formalizes the evolution of propositions over time using linear and branching temporal models, incorporating exponential decay (Ebbinghaus forgetting curve) and reactivation mechanisms via Bayesian updating. The hierarchical organization of memory is represented using directed acyclic graphs to model recall dependencies and interference. Novel insights include feedback dynamics, recursive influences in memory chains, and the integration of entropy-based recall efficiency. This approach provides a foundation for understanding memory processes across cognitive and computational domains.</description>

      <title>SMART: Self-Aware Agent for Tool Overuse Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current Large Language Model (LLM) agents demonstrate strong reasoning and tool use capabilities, but often lack self-awareness, failing to balance these approaches effectively. This imbalance leads to Tool Overuse, where models unnecessarily rely on external tools for tasks solvable with parametric knowledge, increasing computational overhead. Inspired by human metacognition, we introduce SMART (Strategic Model-Aware Reasoning with Tools), a paradigm that enhances an agent's self-awareness to optimize task handling and reduce tool overuse. To support this paradigm, we introduce SMART-ER, a dataset spanning three domains, where reasoning alternates between parametric knowledge and tool-dependent steps, with each step enriched by rationales explaining when tools are necessary. Through supervised training, we develop SMARTAgent, a family of models that dynamically balance parametric knowledge and tool use. Evaluations show that SMARTAgent reduces tool use by 24% while improving performance by over 37%, enabling 7B-scale models to match its 70B counterpart and GPT-4o. Additionally, SMARTAgent generalizes to out-of-distribution test data like GSM8K and MINTQA, maintaining accuracy with just one-fifth the tool calls. These highlight the potential of strategic tool use to enhance reasoning, mitigate overuse, and bridge the gap between model size and performance, advancing intelligent and resource-efficient agent designs.</description>

      <title>Why Vision Language Models Struggle with Visual Arithmetic? Towards Enhanced Chart and Geometry Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal tasks, yet they often struggle with visual arithmetic, seemingly simple capabilities like object counting or length comparison, which are essential for relevant complex tasks like chart understanding and geometric reasoning. In this work, we first investigate the root causes of this deficiency through a suite of probing tasks focusing on basic visual arithmetic. Our analysis reveals that while pre-trained vision encoders typically capture sufficient information, the text decoder often fails to decode it correctly for arithmetic reasoning. To address this, we propose CogAlign, a novel post-training strategy inspired by Piaget's theory of cognitive development. CogAlign trains VLMs to recognize invariant properties under visual transformations. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the performance of three diverse VLMs on our proposed probing tasks. Furthermore, CogAlign enhances performance by an average of 4.6% on CHOCOLATE and 2.9% on MATH-VISION, outperforming or matching supervised fine-tuning methods while requiring only 60% less training data. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of CogAlign in improving fundamental visual arithmetic capabilities and their transfer to downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>KnowPath: Knowledge-enhanced Reasoning via LLM-generated Inference Paths over Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various complex tasks, yet they still suffer from hallucinations. By incorporating and exploring external knowledge, such as knowledge graphs(KGs), LLM's ability to provide factual answers has been enhanced. This approach carries significant practical implications. However, existing methods suffer from three key limitations: insufficient mining of LLMs' internal knowledge, constrained generation of interpretable reasoning paths, and unclear fusion of internal and external knowledge. Therefore, we propose KnowPath, a knowledge-enhanced large model framework driven by the collaboration of internal and external knowledge. It relies on the internal knowledge of the LLM to guide the exploration of interpretable directed subgraphs in external knowledge graphs, better integrating the two knowledge sources for more accurate reasoning. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of KnowPath. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/tize-72/KnowPath.</description>

      <title>PhysReason: A Comprehensive Benchmark towards Physics-Based Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities across various domains, especially mathematics and logic reasoning. However, current evaluations overlook physics-based reasoning - a complex task requiring physics theorems and constraints. We present PhysReason, a 1,200-problem benchmark comprising knowledge-based (25%) and reasoning-based (75%) problems, where the latter are divided into three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard). Notably, problems require an average of 8.1 solution steps, with hard requiring 15.6, reflecting the complexity of physics-based reasoning. We propose the Physics Solution Auto Scoring Framework, incorporating efficient answer-level and comprehensive step-level evaluations. Top-performing models like Deepseek-R1, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, and o3-mini-high achieve less than 60% on answer-level evaluation, with performance dropping from knowledge questions (75.11%) to hard problems (31.95%). Through step-level evaluation, we identified four key bottlenecks: Physics Theorem Application, Physics Process Understanding, Calculation, and Physics Condition Analysis. These findings position PhysReason as a novel and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating physics-based reasoning capabilities in large language models. Our code and data will be published at https:/dxzxy12138.github.io/PhysReason.</description>

      <title>HPS: Hard Preference Sampling for Human Preference Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aligning Large Language Model (LLM) responses with human preferences is vital for building safe and controllable AI systems. While preference optimization methods based on Plackett-Luce (PL) and Bradley-Terry (BT) models have shown promise, they face challenges such as poor handling of harmful content, inefficient use of dispreferred responses, and, specifically for PL, high computational costs. To address these issues, we propose Hard Preference Sampling (HPS), a novel framework for robust and efficient human preference alignment. HPS introduces a training loss that prioritizes the most preferred response while rejecting all dispreferred and harmful ones. It emphasizes "hard" dispreferred responses -- those closely resembling preferred ones -- to enhance the model's rejection capabilities. By leveraging a single-sample Monte Carlo sampling strategy, HPS reduces computational overhead while maintaining alignment quality. Theoretically, HPS improves sample efficiency over existing PL methods and maximizes the reward margin between preferred and dispreferred responses, ensuring clearer distinctions. Experiments on HH-RLHF and PKU-Safety datasets validate HPS's effectiveness, achieving comparable BLEU and reward scores while greatly improving reward margins and thus reducing harmful content generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge components (KCs) mapped to problems help model student learning, tracking their mastery levels on fine-grained skills thereby facilitating personalized learning and feedback in online learning platforms. However, crafting and tagging KCs to problems, traditionally performed by human domain experts, is highly labor-intensive. We present a fully automated, LLM-based pipeline for KC generation and tagging for open-ended programming problems. We also develop an LLM-based knowledge tracing (KT) framework to leverage these LLM-generated KCs, which we refer to as KCGen-KT. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on a real-world student code submission dataset. We find that KCGen-KT outperforms existing KT methods and human-written KCs on future student response prediction. We investigate the learning curves of generated KCs and show that LLM-generated KCs result in a better fit than human-written KCs under a cognitive model. We also conduct a human evaluation with course instructors to show that our pipeline generates reasonably accurate problem-KC mappings.</description>

Abstract: Understanding domain-specific theorems often requires more than just text-based reasoning; effective communication through structured visual explanations is crucial for deeper comprehension. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in text-based theorem reasoning, their ability to generate coherent and pedagogically meaningful visual explanations remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce TheoremExplainAgent, an agentic approach for generating long-form theorem explanation videos (over 5 minutes) using Manim animations. To systematically evaluate multimodal theorem explanations, we propose TheoremExplainBench, a benchmark covering 240 theorems across multiple STEM disciplines, along with 5 automated evaluation metrics. Our results reveal that agentic planning is essential for generating detailed long-form videos, and the o3-mini agent achieves a success rate of 93.8% and an overall score of 0.77. However, our quantitative and qualitative studies show that most of the videos produced exhibit minor issues with visual element layout. Furthermore, multimodal explanations expose deeper reasoning flaws that text-based explanations fail to reveal, highlighting the importance of multimodal explanations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When users work with AI agents, they form conscious or subconscious expectations of them. Meeting user expectations is crucial for such agents to engage in successful interactions and teaming. However, users may form expectations of an agent that differ from the agent's planned behaviors. These differences lead to the consideration of two separate decision models in the planning process to generate explicable behaviors. However, little has been done to incorporate safety considerations, especially in a learning setting. We present Safe Explicable Policy Search (SEPS), which aims to provide a learning approach to explicable behavior generation while minimizing the safety risk, both during and after learning. We formulate SEPS as a constrained optimization problem where the agent aims to maximize an explicability score subject to constraints on safety and a suboptimality criterion based on the agent's model. SEPS innovatively combines the capabilities of Constrained Policy Optimization and Explicable Policy Search. We evaluate SEPS in safety-gym environments and with a physical robot experiment to show that it can learn explicable behaviors that adhere to the agent's safety requirements and are efficient. Results show that SEPS can generate safe and explicable behaviors while ensuring a desired level of performance w.r.t. the agent's objective, and has real-world relevance in human-AI teaming.</description>

      <title>Value Gradients with Action Adaptive Search Trees in Continuous (PO)MDPs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) in continuous state, action and observation spaces is key for autonomous planning in many real-world mobility and robotics applications. Current approaches are mostly sample based, and cannot hope to reach near-optimal solutions in reasonable time. We propose two complementary theoretical contributions. First, we formulate a novel Multiple Importance Sampling (MIS) tree for value estimation, that allows to share value information between sibling action branches. The novel MIS tree supports action updates during search time, such as gradient-based updates. Second, we propose a novel methodology to compute value gradients with online sampling based on transition likelihoods. It is applicable to MDPs, and we extend it to POMDPs via particle beliefs with the application of the propagated belief trick. The gradient estimator is computed in practice using the MIS tree with efficient Monte Carlo sampling. These two parts are combined into a new planning algorithm Action Gradient Monte Carlo Tree Search (AGMCTS). We demonstrate in a simulated environment its applicability, advantages over continuous online POMDP solvers that rely solely on sampling, and we discuss further implications.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising capabilities in interpreting visualized graph data, offering a new perspective for graph-structured reasoning beyond traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, existing studies focus primarily on single-graph reasoning, leaving the critical challenge of multi-graph joint reasoning underexplored. In this work, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and enhance the multi-graph reasoning abilities of VLMs. Our benchmark covers four common graph types-knowledge graphs, flowcharts, mind maps, and route maps-and supports both homogeneous and heterogeneous graph groupings with tasks of increasing complexity. We evaluate several state-of-the-art VLMs under a multi-dimensional scoring framework that assesses graph parsing, reasoning consistency, and instruction-following accuracy. Additionally, we fine-tune multiple open-source models and observe consistent improvements, confirming the effectiveness of our dataset. This work provides a principled step toward advancing multi-graph understanding and reveals new opportunities for cross-modal graph intelligence.</description>

      <title>UI-R1: Enhancing Efficient Action Prediction of GUI Agents by Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21620v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent DeepSeek-R1 has showcased the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs through reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards. Despite its success in language models, its application in multi-modal domains, particularly in graphic user interface (GUI) agent tasks, remains under-explored. To address this issue, we propose UI-R1, the first framework to explore how rule-based RL can enhance the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI action prediction tasks. Specifically, UI-R1 introduces a novel rule-based action reward, enabling model optimization via policy-based algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). For efficient training, we curate a small yet high-quality dataset of 136 challenging tasks, encompassing five common action types on mobile devices. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed UI-R1-3B achieves significant improvements over the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks, with average accuracy gains of 22.1% on ScreenSpot, 6.0% on ScreenSpot-Pro, and 12.7% on ANDROIDCONTROL. Furthermore, UI-R1-3B delivers competitive performance compared to larger models (e.g., OS-Atlas-7B) trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on 76K samples. We additionally develop an optimized version, UI-R1-E-3B, which significantly improves both grounding efficiency and accuracy. These results underscore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning to advance GUI understanding and control, paving the way for future research in this domain.

Abstract: With the advancement of web techniques, they have significantly revolutionized various aspects of people's lives. Despite the importance of the web, many tasks performed on it are repetitive and time-consuming, negatively impacting overall quality of life. To efficiently handle these tedious daily tasks, one of the most promising approaches is to advance autonomous agents based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, referred to as AI Agents, as they can operate continuously without fatigue or performance degradation. In the context of the web, leveraging AI Agents -- termed WebAgents -- to automatically assist people in handling tedious daily tasks can dramatically enhance productivity and efficiency. Recently, Large Foundation Models (LFMs) containing billions of parameters have exhibited human-like language understanding and reasoning capabilities, showing proficiency in performing various complex tasks. This naturally raises the question: `Can LFMs be utilized to develop powerful AI Agents that automatically handle web tasks, providing significant convenience to users?' To fully explore the potential of LFMs, extensive research has emerged on WebAgents designed to complete daily web tasks according to user instructions, significantly enhancing the convenience of daily human life. In this survey, we comprehensively review existing research studies on WebAgents across three key aspects: architectures, training, and trustworthiness. Additionally, several promising directions for future research are explored to provide deeper insights.</description>

      <title>An Illusion of Progress? Assessing the Current State of Web Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As digitalization and cloud technologies evolve, the web is becoming increasingly important in the modern society. Autonomous web agents based on large language models (LLMs) hold a great potential in work automation. It is therefore important to accurately measure and monitor the progression of their capabilities. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of the current state of web agents. Our results depict a very different picture of the competency of current agents, suggesting over-optimism in previously reported results. This gap can be attributed to shortcomings in existing benchmarks. We introduce Online-Mind2Web, an online evaluation benchmark consisting of 300 diverse and realistic tasks spanning 136 websites. It enables us to evaluate web agents under a setting that approximates how real users use these agents. To facilitate more scalable evaluation and development, we also develop a novel LLM-as-a-Judge automatic evaluation method and show that it can achieve around 85% agreement with human judgment, substantially higher than existing methods. Finally, we present the first comprehensive comparative analysis of current web agents, highlighting both their strengths and limitations to inspire future research.</description>

      <title>FamilyTool: A Multi-hop Personalized Tool Use Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of tool learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) has expanded their capabilities in handling complex tasks by leveraging external tools. However, existing benchmarks for tool learning inadequately address critical real-world personalized scenarios, particularly those requiring multi-hop reasoning and inductive knowledge adaptation in dynamic environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce FamilyTool, a novel benchmark grounded in a family-based knowledge graph (KG) that simulates personalized, multi-hop tool use scenarios. FamilyTool, including base and extended datasets, challenges LLMs with queries spanning from 1 to 4 relational hops (e.g., inferring familial connections and preferences) and 2 to 6 hops respectively, and incorporates an inductive KG setting where models must adapt to unseen user preferences and relationships without re-training, a common limitation in prior approaches that compromises generalization. We further propose KGETool: a simple KG-augmented evaluation pipeline to systematically assess LLMs' tool use ability in these settings. Experiments reveal significant performance gaps in state-of-the-art LLMs, with accuracy dropping sharply as hop complexity increases and inductive scenarios exposing severe generalization deficits. These findings underscore the limitations of current LLMs in handling personalized, evolving real-world contexts and highlight the urgent need for advancements in tool-learning frameworks. FamilyTool serves as a critical resource for evaluating and advancing LLM agents' reasoning, adaptability, and scalability in complex, dynamic environments.

      <title>ARise: Towards Knowledge-Augmented Reasoning via Risk-Adaptive Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities and are receiving increasing attention to enhance their reasoning through scaling test--time compute. However, their application in open--ended, knowledge--intensive, complex reasoning scenarios is still limited. Reasoning--oriented methods struggle to generalize to open--ended scenarios due to implicit assumptions of complete world knowledge. Meanwhile, knowledge--augmented reasoning (KAR) methods fail to address two core challenges: 1) error propagation, where errors in early steps cascade through the chain, and 2) verification bottleneck, where the explore--exploit tradeoff arises in multi--branch decision processes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ARise, a novel framework that integrates risk assessment of intermediate reasoning states with dynamic retrieval--augmented generation (RAG) within a Monte Carlo tree search paradigm. This approach enables effective construction and optimization of reasoning plans across multiple maintained hypothesis branches. Experimental results show that ARise significantly outperforms the state--of--the--art KAR methods by up to 23.10%, and the latest RAG-equipped large reasoning models by up to 25.37%.

      <description>arXiv:2504.14191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized human-AI interaction and achieved significant success in the generation of novel ideas. However, current assessments of idea generation overlook crucial factors such as knowledge leakage in LLMs, the absence of open-ended benchmarks with grounded truth, and the limited scope of feasibility analysis constrained by prompt design. These limitations hinder the potential of uncovering groundbreaking research ideas. In this paper, we present AI Idea Bench 2025, a framework designed to quantitatively evaluate and compare the ideas generated by LLMs within the domain of AI research from diverse perspectives. The framework comprises a comprehensive dataset of 3,495 AI papers and their associated inspired works, along with a robust evaluation methodology. This evaluation system gauges idea quality in two dimensions: alignment with the ground-truth content of the original papers and judgment based on general reference material. AI Idea Bench 2025's benchmarking system stands to be an invaluable resource for assessing and comparing idea-generation techniques, thereby facilitating the automation of scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>IRIS: Interactive Research Ideation System for Accelerating Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement in capabilities of large language models (LLMs) raises a pivotal question: How can LLMs accelerate scientific discovery? This work tackles the crucial first stage of research, generating novel hypotheses. While recent work on automated hypothesis generation focuses on multi-agent frameworks and extending test-time compute, none of the approaches effectively incorporate transparency and steerability through a synergistic Human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS: Interactive Research Ideation System, an open-source platform designed for researchers to leverage LLM-assisted scientific ideation. IRIS incorporates innovative features to enhance ideation, including adaptive test-time compute expansion via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), fine-grained feedback mechanism, and query-based literature synthesis. Designed to empower researchers with greater control and insight throughout the ideation process. We additionally conduct a user study with researchers across diverse disciplines, validating the effectiveness of our system in enhancing ideation. We open-source our code at https://github.com/Anikethh/IRIS-Interactive-Research-Ideation-System</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are digital records of patient information, often containing unstructured clinical text. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is essential in EHRs for extracting key medical entities like problems, tests, and treatments to support downstream clinical applications. This paper explores prompt-based medical entity recognition using large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1, guided by various prompt engineering techniques, including zero-shot, few-shot, and an ensemble approach. Among all strategies, GPT-4o with prompt ensemble achieved the highest classification performance with an F1-score of 0.95 and recall of 0.98, outperforming DeepSeek-R1 on the task. The ensemble method improved reliability by aggregating outputs through embedding-based similarity and majority voting.</description>

      <title>The First MPDD Challenge: Multimodal Personality-aware Depression Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health issue affecting diverse age groups, with notable prevalence among college students and the elderly. However, existing datasets and detection methods primarily focus on young adults, neglecting the broader age spectrum and individual differences that influence depression manifestation. Current approaches often establish a direct mapping between multimodal data and depression indicators, failing to capture the complexity and diversity of depression across individuals. This challenge includes two tracks based on age-specific subsets: Track 1 uses the MPDD-Elderly dataset for detecting depression in older adults, and Track 2 uses the MPDD-Young dataset for detecting depression in younger participants. The Multimodal Personality-aware Depression Detection (MPDD) Challenge aims to address this gap by incorporating multimodal data alongside individual difference factors. We provide a baseline model that fuses audio and video modalities with individual difference information to detect depression manifestations in diverse populations. This challenge aims to promote the development of more personalized and accurate de pression detection methods, advancing mental health research and fostering inclusive detection systems. More details are available on the official challenge website: https://hacilab.github.io/MPDDChallenge.github.io.</description>

      <title>InfantAgent-Next: A Multimodal Generalist Agent for Automated Computer Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces \textsc{InfantAgent-Next}, a generalist agent capable of interacting with computers in a multimodal manner, encompassing text, images, audio, and video. Unlike existing approaches that either build intricate workflows around a single large model or only provide workflow modularity, our agent integrates tool-based and pure vision agents within a highly modular architecture, enabling different models to collaboratively solve decoupled tasks in a step-by-step manner. Our generality is demonstrated by our ability to evaluate not only pure vision-based real-world benchmarks (i.e., OSWorld), but also more general or tool-intensive benchmarks (e.g., GAIA and SWE-Bench). Specifically, we achieve $\mathbf{7.27\%}$ accuracy on OSWorld, higher than Claude-Computer-Use. Codes and evaluation scripts are open-sourced at https://github.com/bin123apple/InfantAgent.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Visual Grounding for GUI Agents via Self-Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have made substantial strides in understanding and executing user instructions across diverse platforms. Yet, grounding these instructions to precise interface elements remains challenging, especially in complex, high-resolution, professional environments. Traditional supervised finetuning (SFT) methods often require large volumes of diverse data and exhibit weak generalization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework that incorporates three core strategies: (1) seed data curation to ensure high quality training samples, (2) a dense policy gradient that provides continuous feedback based on prediction accuracy, and (3) a self evolutionary reinforcement finetuning mechanism that iteratively refines the model using attention maps. With only 3k training samples, our 7B-parameter model achieves state-of-the-art results among similarly sized models on three grounding benchmarks. Notably, it attains 47.3\% accuracy on the ScreenSpot-Pro dataset, outperforming much larger models, such as UI-TARS-72B, by a margin of 24.2\%. These findings underscore the effectiveness of RL-based approaches in enhancing GUI agent performance, particularly in high-resolution, complex environments.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Adaptive Retrieval Augmented Generation via Instruction-Driven Representation Reduction of Retrieval Overlaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a pivotal method for expanding the knowledge of large language models. To handle complex queries more effectively, researchers developed Adaptive-RAG (A-RAG) to enhance the generated quality through multiple interactions with external knowledge bases. Despite its effectiveness, A-RAG exacerbates the pre-existing efficiency challenges inherent in RAG, which are attributable to its reliance on multiple iterations of generation. Existing A-RAG approaches process all retrieved contents from scratch. However, they ignore the situation where there is a significant overlap in the content of the retrieval results across rounds. The overlapping content is redundantly represented, which leads to a large proportion of repeated computations, thus affecting the overall efficiency. To address this issue, this paper introduces a model-agnostic approach that can be generally applied to A-RAG methods, which is dedicated to reducing the redundant representation process caused by the overlapping of retrieval results. Specifically, we use cache access and parallel generation to speed up the prefilling and decoding stages respectively. Additionally, we also propose an instruction-driven module to further guide the model to more effectively attend to each part of the content in a more suitable way for LLMs. Experiments show that our approach achieves 2.79 and 2.33 times significant acceleration on average for prefilling and decoding respectively while maintaining equal generation quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the field progresses toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), there is a pressing need for more comprehensive and insightful evaluation frameworks that go beyond aggregate performance metrics. This paper introduces a unified rating system that jointly models the difficulty of individual test cases and the competency of AI models (or humans) across vision, language, and action domains. Unlike existing metrics that focus solely on models, our approach allows for fine-grained, difficulty-aware evaluations through competitive interactions between models and tasks, capturing both the long-tail distribution of real-world challenges and the competency gap between current models and full task mastery. We validate the generalizability and robustness of our system through extensive experiments on multiple established datasets and models across distinct AGI domains. The resulting rating distributions offer novel perspectives and interpretable insights into task difficulty, model progression, and the outstanding challenges that remain on the path to achieving full AGI task mastery.</description>

      <title>Warm Up Before You Train: Unlocking General Reasoning in Resource-Constrained Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing effective reasoning-capable LLMs typically requires training using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) or distillation with carefully curated Long Chain of Thoughts (CoT), both of which depend heavily on extensive training data. This creates a major challenge when the amount of quality training data is scarce. We propose a sample-efficient, two-stage training strategy to develop reasoning LLMs under limited supervision. In the first stage, we "warm up" the model by distilling Long CoTs from a toy domain, namely, Knights \&amp; Knaves (K\&amp;K) logic puzzles to acquire general reasoning skills. In the second stage, we apply RLVR to the warmed-up model using a limited set of target-domain examples. Our experiments demonstrate that this two-phase approach offers several benefits: $(i)$ the warmup phase alone facilitates generalized reasoning, leading to performance improvements across a range of tasks, including MATH, HumanEval$^{+}$, and MMLU-Pro; $(ii)$ When both the base model and the warmed-up model are RLVR trained on the same small dataset ($\leq100$ examples), the warmed-up model consistently outperforms the base model; $(iii)$ Warming up before RLVR training allows a model to maintain cross-domain generalizability even after training on a specific domain; $(iv)$ Introducing warmup in the pipeline improves not only accuracy but also overall sample efficiency during RLVR training. The results in this paper highlight the promise of warmup for building robust reasoning LLMs in data-scarce environments.</description>

      <title>SHARP: Synthesizing High-quality Aligned Reasoning Problems for Large Reasoning Models Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training large reasoning models (LRMs) with reinforcement learning in STEM domains is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality, diverse, and verifiable problem sets. Existing synthesis methods, such as Chain-of-Thought prompting, often generate oversimplified or uncheckable data, limiting model advancement on complex tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce SHARP, a unified approach to Synthesizing High-quality Aligned Reasoning Problems for LRMs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). SHARP encompasses a strategic set of self-alignment principles -- targeting graduate and Olympiad-level difficulty, rigorous logical consistency, and unambiguous, verifiable answers -- and a structured three-phase framework (Alignment, Instantiation, Inference) that ensures thematic diversity and fine-grained control over problem generation. We implement SHARP by leveraging a state-of-the-art LRM to infer and verify challenging STEM questions, then employ a reinforcement learning loop to refine the model's reasoning through verifiable reward signals. Experiments on benchmarks such as GPQA demonstrate that SHARP-augmented training substantially outperforms existing methods, markedly improving complex reasoning accuracy and pushing LRM performance closer to expert-level proficiency. Our contributions include the SHARP strategy, framework design, end-to-end implementation, and experimental evaluation of its effectiveness in elevating LRM reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>MAPLE: Many-Shot Adaptive Pseudo-Labeling for In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle diverse tasks by incorporating multiple input-output examples, known as demonstrations, into the input of LLMs. More recently, advancements in the expanded context windows of LLMs have led to many-shot ICL, which uses hundreds of demonstrations and outperforms few-shot ICL, which relies on fewer examples. However, this approach is often hindered by the high cost of obtaining large amounts of labeled data. To address this challenge, we propose Many-Shot Adaptive Pseudo-LabEling, namely MAPLE, a novel influence-based many-shot ICL framework that utilizes pseudo-labeled samples to compensate for the lack of label information. We first identify a subset of impactful unlabeled samples and perform pseudo-labeling on them by querying LLMs. These pseudo-labeled samples are then adaptively selected and tailored to each test query as input to improve the performance of many-shot ICL, without significant labeling costs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its ability to enhance LLM adaptability and performance with limited labeled data.</description>

      <title>Towards End-to-End Training of Automatic Speech Recognition for Nigerian Pidgin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.11123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prevalence of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems in spoken language applications has increased significantly in recent years. Notably, many African languages lack sufficient linguistic resources to support the robustness of these systems. This paper focuses on the development of an end-to-end speech recognition system customized for Nigerian Pidgin English. We investigated and evaluated different pretrained state-of-the-art architectures on a new dataset. Our empirical results demonstrate a notable performance of the variant Wav2Vec2 XLSR-53 on our dataset, achieving a word error rate (WER) of 29.6% on the test set, surpassing other architectures such as NEMO QUARTZNET and Wav2Vec2.0 BASE-100H in quantitative assessments. Additionally, we demonstrate that pretrained state-of-the-art architectures do not work well out-of-the-box. We performed zero-shot evaluation using XLSR-English as the baseline, chosen for its similarity to Nigerian Pidgin. This yielded a higher WER of 73.7%. By adapting this architecture to nuances represented in our dataset, we reduce error by 59.84%. Our dataset comprises 4,288 recorded utterances from 10 native speakers, partitioned into training, validation, and test sets. This study underscores the potential for improving ASR systems for under-resourced languages like Nigerian Pidgin English, contributing to greater inclusion in speech technology applications. We publicly release our unique parallel dataset (speech-to-text) on Nigerian Pidgin, as well as the model weights on Hugging Face. Our code would be made available to foster future research from the community.</description>

      <title>FedCC: Robust Federated Learning against Model Poisoning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01976v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning is a distributed framework designed to address privacy concerns. However, it introduces new attack surfaces, which are especially prone when data is non-Independently and Identically Distributed. Existing approaches fail to effectively mitigate the malicious influence in this setting; previous approaches often tackle non-IID data and poisoning attacks separately. To address both challenges simultaneously, we present FedCC, a simple yet effective novel defense algorithm against model poisoning attacks. It leverages the Centered Kernel Alignment similarity of Penultimate Layer Representations for clustering, allowing the identification and filtration of malicious clients, even in non-IID data settings. The penultimate layer representations are meaningful since the later layers are more sensitive to local data distributions, which allows better detection of malicious clients. The sophisticated utilization of layer-wise Centered Kernel Alignment similarity allows attack mitigation while leveraging useful knowledge obtained. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FedCC in mitigating both untargeted model poisoning and targeted backdoor attacks. Compared to existing outlier detection-based and first-order statistics-based methods, FedCC consistently reduces attack confidence to zero. Specifically, it significantly minimizes the average degradation of global performance by 65.5\%. We believe that this new perspective on aggregation makes it a valuable contribution to the field of FL model security and privacy. The code will be made available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Policy Gradient with Tree Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Policy gradient methods are notorious for having a large variance and high sample complexity. To mitigate this, we introduce SoftTreeMax -- a generalization of softmax that employs planning. In SoftTreeMax, we extend the traditional logits with the multi-step discounted cumulative reward, topped with the logits of future states. We analyze SoftTreeMax and explain how tree expansion helps to reduce its gradient variance. We prove that the variance depends on the chosen tree-expansion policy. Specifically, we show that the closer the induced transitions are to being state-independent, the stronger the variance decay. With approximate forward models, we prove that the resulting gradient bias diminishes with the approximation error while retaining the same variance reduction. Ours is the first result to bound the gradient bias for an approximate model. In a practical implementation of SoftTreeMax, we utilize a parallel GPU-based simulator for fast and efficient tree expansion. Using this implementation in Atari, we show that SoftTreeMax reduces the gradient variance by three orders of magnitude. This leads to better sample complexity and improved performance compared to distributed PPO.</description>

      <title>Distributional Reinforcement Learning with Dual Expectile-Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16877v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributional reinforcement learning (RL) has proven useful in multiple benchmarks as it enables approximating the full distribution of returns and extracts rich feedback from environment samples. The commonly used quantile regression approach to distributional RL -- based on asymmetric $L_1$ losses -- provides a flexible and effective way of learning arbitrary return distributions. In practice, it is often improved by using a more efficient, asymmetric hybrid $L_1$-$L_2$ Huber loss for quantile regression. However, by doing so, distributional estimation guarantees vanish, and we empirically observe that the estimated distribution rapidly collapses to its mean. Indeed, asymmetric $L_2$ losses, corresponding to expectile regression, cannot be readily used for distributional temporal difference. Motivated by the efficiency of $L_2$-based learning, we propose to jointly learn expectiles and quantiles of the return distribution in a way that allows efficient learning while keeping an estimate of the full distribution of returns. We prove that our proposed operator converges to the distributional Bellman operator in the limit of infinite estimated quantile and expectile fractions, and we benchmark a practical implementation on a toy example and at scale. On the Atari benchmark, our approach matches the performance of the Huber-based IQN-1 baseline after $200$M training frames but avoids distributional collapse and keeps estimates of the full distribution of returns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In today's competitive and fast-evolving business environment, it is a critical time for organizations to rethink how to make talent-related decisions in a quantitative manner. Indeed, the recent development of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have revolutionized human resource management. The availability of large-scale talent and management-related data provides unparalleled opportunities for business leaders to comprehend organizational behaviors and gain tangible knowledge from a data science perspective, which in turn delivers intelligence for real-time decision-making and effective talent management at work for their organizations. In the last decade, talent analytics has emerged as a promising field in applied data science for human resource management, garnering significant attention from AI communities and inspiring numerous research efforts. To this end, we present an up-to-date and comprehensive survey on AI technologies used for talent analytics in the field of human resource management. Specifically, we first provide the background knowledge of talent analytics and categorize various pertinent data. Subsequently, we offer a comprehensive taxonomy of relevant research efforts, categorized based on three distinct application-driven scenarios: talent management, organization management, and labor market analysis. In conclusion, we summarize the open challenges and potential prospects for future research directions in the domain of AI-driven talent analytics.</description>

      <title>Distortion Resilience for Goal-Oriented Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research efforts on Semantic Communication (SemCom) have mostly considered accuracy as a main problem for optimizing goal-oriented communication systems. However, these approaches introduce a paradox: the accuracy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tasks should naturally emerge through training rather than being dictated by network constraints. Acknowledging this dilemma, this work introduces an innovative approach that leverages the rate distortion theory to analyze distortions induced by communication and compression, thereby analyzing the learning process. Specifically, we examine the distribution shift between the original data and the distorted data, thus assessing its impact on the AI model's performance. Founding upon this analysis, we can preemptively estimate the empirical accuracy of AI tasks, making the goal-oriented SemCom problem feasible. To achieve this objective, we present the theoretical foundation of our approach, accompanied by simulations and experiments that demonstrate its effectiveness. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method enables accurate AI task performance while adhering to network constraints, establishing it as a valuable contribution to the field of signal processing. Furthermore, this work advances research in goal-oriented SemCom and highlights the significance of data-driven approaches in optimizing the performance of intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>On Continuity of Robust and Accurate Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reliability of a learning model is key to the successful deployment of machine learning in various applications. However, it is difficult to describe the phenomenon due to the complicated nature of the problems in machine learning. It has been shown that adversarial training can improve the robustness of the hypothesis. However, this improvement usually comes at the cost of decreased performance on natural samples. Hence, it has been suggested that robustness and accuracy of a hypothesis are at odds with each other. In this paper, we put forth the alternative proposal that it is the continuity of a hypothesis that is incompatible with its robustness and accuracy in many of these scenarios. In other words, a continuous function cannot effectively learn the optimal robust hypothesis. We introduce a framework for a rigorous study of harmonic and holomorphic hypothesis in learning theory terms and provide empirical evidence that continuous hypotheses do not perform as well as discontinuous hypotheses in some common machine learning tasks. From a practical point of view, our results suggests that a robust and accurate learning rule would train different continuous hypotheses for different regions of the domain. From a theoretical perspective, our analysis explains the adversarial examples phenomenon in these situations as a conflict between the continuity of a sequence of functions and its uniform convergence to a discontinuous function. Given that many of the contemporary machine learning models are continuous functions, it is important to theoretically study the continuity of robust and accurate classifiers as it is consequential in their construction, analysis and evaluation.</description>

      <title>FERGI: Automatic Scoring of User Preferences for Text-to-Image Generation from Spontaneous Facial Expression Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03187v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers have proposed to use data of human preference feedback to fine-tune text-to-image generative models. However, the scalability of human feedback collection has been limited by its reliance on manual annotation. Therefore, we develop and test a method to automatically score user preferences from their spontaneous facial expression reaction to the generated images. We collect a dataset of Facial Expression Reaction to Generated Images (FERGI) and show that the activations of multiple facial action units (AUs) are highly correlated with user evaluations of the generated images. We develop an FAU-Net (Facial Action Units Neural Network), which receives inputs from an AU estimation model, to automatically score user preferences for text-to-image generation based on their facial expression reactions, which is complementary to the pre-trained scoring models based on the input text prompts and generated images. Integrating our FAU-Net valence score with the pre-trained scoring models improves their consistency with human preferences. This method of automatic annotation with facial expression analysis can be potentially generalized to other generation tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/ShuangquanFeng/FERGI, and the dataset is also available at the same link for research purposes.</description>

      <title>Robust Plan Evaluation based on Approximate Probabilistic Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15210v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Query optimizers in RDBMSs search for execution plans expected to be optimal for given queries. They use parameter estimates, often inaccurate, and make assumptions that may not hold in practice. Consequently, they may select plans that are suboptimal at runtime if estimates and assumptions are not valid. Therefore, they do not sufficiently support robust query optimization. Using ML to improve data systems has shown promising results for query optimization. Inspired by this, we propose Robust Query Optimizer (Roq), a holistic framework based on a risk-aware learning approach. Roq includes a novel formalization of the notion of robustness in the context of query optimization and a principled approach for its quantification and measurement based on approximate probabilistic ML. It also includes novel strategies and algorithms for query plan evaluation and selection. Roq includes a novel learned cost model that is designed to predict the cost of query execution and the associated risks and performs query optimization accordingly. We demonstrate that Roq provides significant improvements in robust query optimization compared with the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Measuring Machine Learning Harms from Stereotypes Requires Understanding Who Is Harmed by Which Errors in What Ways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As machine learning applications proliferate, we need an understanding of their potential for harm. However, current fairness metrics are rarely grounded in human psychological experiences of harm. Drawing on the social psychology of stereotypes, we use a case study of gender stereotypes in image search to examine how people react to machine learning errors. First, we use survey studies to show that not all machine learning errors reflect stereotypes nor are equally harmful. Then, in experimental studies we randomly expose participants to stereotype-reinforcing, -violating, and -neutral machine learning errors. We find stereotype-reinforcing errors induce more experientially (i.e., subjectively) harmful experiences, while having minimal changes to cognitive beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors. This experiential harm impacts women more than men. However, certain stereotype-violating errors are more experientially harmful for men, potentially due to perceived threats to masculinity. We conclude that harm cannot be the sole guide in fairness mitigation, and propose a nuanced perspective depending on who is experiencing what harm and why.</description>

      <title>JailbreakRadar: Comprehensive Assessment of Jailbreak Attacks Against LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jailbreak attacks aim to bypass the LLMs' safeguards. While researchers have proposed different jailbreak attacks in depth, they have done so in isolation -- either with unaligned settings or comparing a limited range of methods. To fill this gap, we present a large-scale evaluation of various jailbreak attacks. We collect 17 representative jailbreak attacks, summarize their features, and establish a novel jailbreak attack taxonomy. Then we conduct comprehensive measurement and ablation studies across nine aligned LLMs on 160 forbidden questions from 16 violation categories. Also, we test jailbreak attacks under eight advanced defenses. Based on our taxonomy and experiments, we identify some important patterns, such as heuristic-based attacks could achieve high attack success rates but are easy to mitigate by defenses, causing low practicality. Our study offers valuable insights for future research on jailbreak attacks and defenses. We hope our work could help the community avoid incremental work and serve as an effective benchmark tool for practitioners.</description>

      <title>QUCE: The Minimisation and Quantification of Path-Based Uncertainty for Generative Counterfactual Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17516v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) stand out as one of the most prominent approaches within the Machine Learning (ML) domain. The efficacy of DNNs has surged alongside recent increases in computational capacity, allowing these approaches to scale to significant complexities for addressing predictive challenges in big data. However, as the complexity of DNN models rises, interpretability diminishes. In response to this challenge, explainable models such as Adversarial Gradient Integration (AGI) leverage path-based gradients provided by DNNs to elucidate their decisions. Yet the performance of path-based explainers can be compromised when gradients exhibit irregularities during out-of-distribution path traversal. In this context, we introduce Quantified Uncertainty Counterfactual Explanations (QUCE), a method designed to mitigate out-of-distribution traversal by minimizing path uncertainty. QUCE not only quantifies uncertainty when presenting explanations but also generates more certain counterfactual examples. We showcase the performance of the QUCE method by comparing it with competing methods for both path-based explanations and generative counterfactual examples.</description>

Abstract: Exploiting sparsity in deep neural networks (DNNs) has been a promising area for meeting the growing computation requirements. To minimize the overhead of sparse acceleration, hardware designers have proposed structured sparsity support, but it provides limited flexibility and requires extra model fine-tuning. Moreover, any sparse model fine-tuned for certain structured sparse HW cannot be accelerated by other structured hardware. To enable acceleration using unstructured sparsity of DNNs on structured sparse hardware, we propose an approximation method leveraging the distributive property in linear algebra to turn any sparse tensor into a series of structured sparse tensors. We also develop a software framework, TASDER, to apply high-quality structured approximation on weights and activations of DNNs. Our method accelerates dense and sparse DNNs without fine-tuning and improves energy-delay-product (EDP) by up to 83% and 74%. It achieves up to 39% speed-up on a real system.</description>

      <title>Bridging Privacy and Robustness for Trustworthy Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: The advent of machine learning has led to transformative changes across various domains, but the sensitive nature of data raises concerns about privacy and security. While Local Differential Privacy (LDP) has been a cornerstone in addressing these concerns, recent research has proposed privacy concepts aligned with the Bayesian inference perspective of an adversary, such as Average Bayesian Privacy (ABP) and Maximum Bayesian Privacy (MBP). This paper explores the intricate relationships between LDP, ABP, and MBP, and their implications for algorithmic robustness. We establish theoretical connections between these privacy notions, proving that LDP implies MBP and vice versa under certain conditions, and deriving bounds connecting MBP and ABP. We also investigate the relationship between PAC robust learning and privacy preservation, demonstrating how to derive PAC robustness from privacy-preserving algorithms and construct privacy-preserving algorithms from PAC robust ones. Our findings provide valuable insights for constructing privacy-preserving and robust machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>SCANet: Correcting LEGO Assembly Errors with Self-Correct Assembly Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18195v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous assembly in robotics and 3D vision presents significant challenges, particularly in ensuring assembly correctness. Presently, predominant methods such as MEPNet focus on assembling components based on manually provided images. However, these approaches often fall short in achieving satisfactory results for tasks requiring long-term planning. Concurrently, we observe that integrating a self-correction module can partially alleviate such issues. Motivated by this concern, we introduce the Single-Step Assembly Error Correction Task, which involves identifying and rectifying misassembled components. To support research in this area, we present the LEGO Error Correction Assembly Dataset (LEGO-ECA), comprising manual images for assembly steps and instances of assembly failures. Additionally, we propose the Self-Correct Assembly Network (SCANet), a novel method to address this task. SCANet treats assembled components as queries, determining their correctness in manual images and providing corrections when necessary. Finally, we utilize SCANet to correct the assembly results of MEPNet. Experimental results demonstrate that SCANet can identify and correct MEPNet's misassembled results, significantly improving the correctness of assembly. Our code and dataset could be found at https://scanet-iros2024.github.io/.</description>

      <title>TG-NAS: Generalizable Zero-Cost Proxies with Operator Description Embedding and Graph Learning for Efficient Neural Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a powerful technique for discovering high-performing CNN architectures, but most existing methods rely on costly training or extensive sampling. Zero-shot NAS offers a training-free alternative by using proxies to predict architecture performance. However, existing proxies are often suboptimal -- frequently outperformed by simple metrics like parameter count or FLOPs -- and they generalize poorly across different search spaces. Moreover, current model-based proxies struggle to adapt to new operators without access to ground-truth accuracy, limiting their transferability. We propose TG-NAS, a universal, model-based zero-cost (ZC) proxy that combines a Transformer-based operator embedding generator with a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to predict architecture performance. Unlike prior model-based predictors, TG-NAS requires no retraining and generalizes across arbitrary search spaces. It serves as a standalone ZC proxy with strong data efficiency, robustness, and cross-space consistency. Extensive evaluations across diverse NAS benchmarks demonstrate TG-NAS's superior rank correlation and generalizability compared to existing proxies. Additionally, it improves search efficiency by up to 300x and discovers architectures achieving 93.75% CIFAR-10 accuracy on NAS-Bench-201 and 74.9% ImageNet top-1 accuracy on the DARTS space, establishing TG-NAS as a promising foundation for efficient, generalizable NAS.</description>

      <title>Query Performance Prediction using Relevance Judgments Generated by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Query performance prediction (QPP) aims to estimate the retrieval quality of a search system for a query without human relevance judgments. Previous QPP methods typically return a single scalar value and do not require the predicted values to approximate a specific information retrieval (IR) evaluation measure, leading to certain drawbacks: (i) a single scalar is insufficient to accurately represent different IR evaluation measures, especially when metrics do not highly correlate, and (ii) a single scalar limits the interpretability of QPP methods because solely using a scalar is insufficient to explain QPP results. To address these issues, we propose a QPP framework using automatically generated relevance judgments (QPP-GenRE), which decomposes QPP into independent subtasks of predicting the relevance of each item in a ranked list to a given query. This allows us to predict any IR evaluation measure using the generated relevance judgments as pseudo-labels. This also allows us to interpret predicted IR evaluation measures, and identify, track and rectify errors in generated relevance judgments to improve QPP quality. We predict an item's relevance by using open-source large language models (LLMs) to ensure scientific reproducibility. We face two main challenges: (i) excessive computational costs of judging an entire corpus for predicting a metric considering recall, and (ii) limited performance in prompting open-source LLMs in a zero-/few-shot manner. To solve the challenges, we devise an approximation strategy to predict an IR measure considering recall and propose to fine-tune open-source LLMs using human-labeled relevance judgments. Experiments on the TREC 2019 to 2022 deep learning tracks and CAsT-19 and 20 datasets show that QPP-GenRE achieves state-of-the-art QPP quality for both lexical and neural rankers.</description>

      <title>Jailbreaking Prompt Attack: A Controllable Adversarial Attack against Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02928v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models can be maliciously used to generate harmful content such as sexually explicit, unfaithful, and misleading or Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) images. Previous attacks largely depend on the availability of the diffusion model or involve a lengthy optimization process. In this work, we investigate a more practical and universal attack that does not require the presence of a target model and demonstrate that the high-dimensional text embedding space inherently contains NSFW concepts that can be exploited to generate harmful images. We present the Jailbreaking Prompt Attack (JPA). JPA first searches for the target malicious concepts in the text embedding space using a group of antonyms generated by ChatGPT. Subsequently, a prefix prompt is optimized in the discrete vocabulary space to align malicious concepts semantically in the text embedding space. We further introduce a soft assignment with gradient masking technique that allows us to perform gradient ascent in the discrete vocabulary space.
  We perform extensive experiments with open-sourced T2I models, e.g. stable-diffusion-v1-4 and closed-sourced online services, e.g. DALLE2, Midjourney with black-box safety checkers. Results show that (1) JPA bypasses both text and image safety checkers (2) while preserving high semantic alignment with the target prompt. (3) JPA demonstrates a much faster speed than previous methods and can be executed in a fully automated manner. These merits render it a valuable tool for robustness evaluation in future text-to-image generation research.</description>

      <title>A Generative Approach to Credit Prediction with Learnable Prompts for Multi-scale Temporal Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13004v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent industrial credit scoring models remain heavily reliant on manually tuned statistical learning methods. While deep learning offers promising solutions, its effectiveness is often limited by the complexity of financial data, particularly in long-horizon scenarios. In this work, we propose FinLangNet, which addresses credit scoring by reframing it as the task of generating multi-scale distributions of a user's future behavior. Within this framework, tabular data is transformed into sequential representations, enabling the generation of user embeddings across multiple temporal scales. Inspired by the recent success of prompt-based training in Large Language Models (LLMs), FinLangNet also introduces two types of prompts to model and capture user behavior at both the feature-granularity and user-granularity levels. Experimental results demonstrate that FinLangNet outperforms the online XGBoost benchmark, achieving a 7.2\% improvement in KS metric performance and a 9.9\% reduction in the relative bad debt rate. Furthermore, FinLangNet exhibits superior performance on public UEA archives, underscoring its scalability and adaptability in time series classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Guarding Graph Neural Networks for Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised graph anomaly detection aims at identifying rare patterns that deviate from the majority in a graph without the aid of labels, which is important for a variety of real-world applications. Recent advances have utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn effective node representations by aggregating information from neighborhoods. This is motivated by the hypothesis that nodes in the graph tend to exhibit consistent behaviors with their neighborhoods. However, such consistency can be disrupted by graph anomalies in multiple ways. Most existing methods directly employ GNNs to learn representations, disregarding the negative impact of graph anomalies on GNNs, resulting in sub-optimal node representations and anomaly detection performance. While a few recent approaches have redesigned GNNs for graph anomaly detection under semi-supervised label guidance, how to address the adverse effects of graph anomalies on GNNs in unsupervised scenarios and learn effective representations for anomaly detection are still under-explored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for Guarding Graph Neural Networks for Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection (G3AD). Specifically, G3AD first introduces two auxiliary networks along with correlation constraints to guard the GNNs against inconsistent information encoding. Furthermore, G3AD introduces an adaptive caching module to guard the GNNs from directly reconstructing the observed graph data that contains anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our G3AD can outperform twenty state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world graph anomaly datasets, with flexible generalization ability in different GNN backbones.</description>

      <title>Model Extrapolation Expedites Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16792v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the high computational cost of preference alignment training of large language models (LLMs), exploring efficient methods to reduce the training overhead remains an important and compelling research problem. Motivated by the observation that alignment training typically involves only small parameter changes without injecting new knowledge into models, we propose a straightforward method called ExPO (model extrapolation) to expedite LLMs' alignment with human preferences. Given a partially-trained model and its initial SFT checkpoint, ExPO improves the implicit optimization objective of alignment training by simply amplifying the parameter change based on a first-order approximation, without any additional training overhead. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that ExPO boosts a DPO model trained with only 20% steps to outperform the fully-trained one. Moreover, we show that ExPO notably improves existing open-source LLMs (ranging from 1.8B to 70B parameters) on the leading AlpacaEval 2.0 and MT-Bench benchmarks, which highlights ExPO's broader utility in efficiently enhancing LLM alignment.</description>

      <title>Combating Concept Drift with Explanatory Detection and Adaptation for Android Malware Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-based Android malware classifiers achieve high accuracy in stationary environments but struggle with concept drift. The rapid evolution of malware, especially with new families, can depress classification accuracy to near-random levels. Previous research has largely centered on detecting drift samples, with expert-led label revisions on these samples to guide model retraining. However, these methods often lack a comprehensive understanding of malware concepts and provide limited guidance for effective drift adaptation, leading to unstable detection performance and high human labeling costs.
  To combat concept drift, we propose DREAM, a novel system that improves drift detection and establishes an explanatory adaptation process. Our core idea is to integrate classifier and expert knowledge within a unified model. To achieve this, we embed malware explanations (or concepts) within the latent space of a contrastive autoencoder, while constraining sample reconstruction based on classifier predictions. This approach enhances classifier retraining in two key ways: 1) capturing the target classifier's characteristics to select more effective samples in drift detection and 2) enabling concept revisions that extend the classifier's semantics to provide stronger guidance for adaptation. Additionally, DREAM eliminates reliance on training data during real-time drift detection and provides a behavior-based drift explainer to support concept revision. Our evaluation shows that DREAM effectively improves the drift detection accuracy and reduces the expert analysis effort in adaptation across different malware datasets and classifiers. Notably, when updating a widely-used Drebin classifier, DREAM achieves the same accuracy with 76.6% fewer newly labeled samples compared to the best existing methods.</description>

      <title>On the Volatility of Shapley-Based Contribution Metrics in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08044v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative and privacy-preserving Machine Learning paradigm, allowing the development of robust models without the need to centralize sensitive data. A critical challenge in FL lies in fairly and accurately allocating contributions from diverse participants. Inaccurate allocation can undermine trust, lead to unfair compensation, and thus participants may lack the incentive to join or actively contribute to the federation. Various remuneration strategies have been proposed to date, including auction-based approaches and Shapley-value-based methods, the latter offering a means to quantify the contribution of each participant. However, little to no work has studied the stability of these contribution evaluation methods. In this paper, we evaluate participant contributions in federated learning using gradient-based model reconstruction techniques with Shapley values and compare the round-based contributions to a classic data contribution measurement scheme. We provide an extensive analysis of the discrepancies of Shapley values across a set of aggregation strategies and examine them on an overall and a per-client level. We show that, between different aggregation techniques, Shapley values lead to unstable reward allocations among participants. Our analysis spans various data heterogeneity distributions, including independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID scenarios.</description>

      <title>A fast algorithm to minimize prediction loss of the optimal solution in inverse optimization problem of MILP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the inverse optimization problem of estimating the weights of the objective function such that the given solution is an optimal solution for a mixed integer linear program (MILP). In this inverse optimization problem, the known methods exhibit inefficient convergence. Specifically, if $d$ denotes the dimension of the weights and $k$ the number of iterations, then the error of the weights is bounded by $O(k^{-1/(d-1)})$, leading to slow convergence as $d$ increases. We propose a projected subgradient method with a step size of $k^{-1/2}$ based on suboptimality loss. We theoretically show and demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently learns the weights. In particular, we show that there exists a constant $\gamma &gt; 0$ such that the distance between the learned and true weights is bounded by $ O\left(k^{-1/(1+\gamma)} \exp\left(-\frac{\gamma k^{1/2}}{2+\gamma}\right)\right), $ or the optimal solution is exactly recovered. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that the proposed method solves the inverse optimization problems of MILP using fewer than $1/7$ the number of MILP calls required by known methods, and converges within a finite number of iterations.</description>

      <title>Out-of-distribution Reject Option Method for Dataset Shift Problem in Early Disease Onset Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly used to predict lifestyle-related disease onset using health and medical data. However, its predictive accuracy for use is often hindered by dataset shift, which refers to discrepancies in data distribution between the training and testing datasets. This issue leads to the misclassification of out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To diminish dataset shift in real-world settings, this paper proposes the out-of-distribution reject option for prediction (ODROP). This method integrates an OOD detection model to preclude OOD data from the prediction phase. We used two real-world health checkup datasets (Hirosaki and Wakayama) with dataset shift, across three disease onset prediction tasks: diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Both components of ODROP method -- the OOD detection model and the prediction model -- were trained on the Hirosaki dataset. We assessed the effectiveness of ODROP on the Wakayama dataset using AUROC-rejection rate curve plot. In the five OOD detection approaches (the variational autoencoder, neural network ensemble std, neural network ensemble epistemic, neural network energy, and neural network gaussian mixture based energy measurement), the variational autoencoder method demonstrated notably higher stability and a greater improvement in AUROC. For example, in the Wakayama dataset, the AUROC for diabetes onset increased from 0.80 without ODROP to 0.90 at a 31.1% rejection rate, and for dyslipidemia, it improved from 0.70 without ODROP to 0.76 at a 34% rejection rate. In addition, we categorized dataset shifts into two types using SHAP clustering -- those that considerably affect predictions and those that do not. This study is the first to apply OOD detection to actual health and medical data, demonstrating its potential to substantially improve the accuracy and reliability of disease prediction models amidst dataset shift.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many state-of-the-art models trained on long-range sequences, for example S4, S5 or LRU, are made of sequential blocks combining State-Space Models (SSMs) with neural networks. In this paper we provide a PAC bound that holds for these kind of architectures with \emph{stable} SSM blocks and does not depend on the length of the input sequence. Imposing stability of the SSM blocks is a standard practice in the literature, and it is known to help performance. Our results provide a theoretical justification for the use of stable SSM blocks as the proposed PAC bound decreases as the degree of stability of the SSM blocks increases.</description>

      <title>Parrot: Multilingual Visual Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, marks a significant step toward artificial general intelligence. Existing methods typically align vision encoders with LLMs via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but this often deteriorates their ability to handle multiple languages as training progresses. We empirically observe that imbalanced SFT datasets, largely English-centric, degrade performance on non-English languages due to the failure in multilingual token alignment. To address this, we propose PARROT, a novel approach that leverages textual guidance for visual token alignment at the language level. PARROT conditions visual tokens on diverse language inputs and uses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to align multilingual tokens. By computing cross-attention between initial visual features and textual embeddings, we select the most relevant experts, converting visual tokens into language-specific representations. Additionally, we introduce the Massive Multilingual Multimodal Benchmark (MMMB), a new benchmark comprising 6 languages, 15 categories, and 12,000 questions, to assess multilingual capabilities. PARROT achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the multilingual benchmarks and a wide range of multimodal tasks.

      <title>Toward Reliable Ad-hoc Scientific Information Extraction: A Case Study on Two Materials Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the ability of GPT-4 to perform ad-hoc schema based information extraction from scientific literature. We assess specifically whether it can, with a basic prompting approach, replicate two existing material science datasets, given the manuscripts from which they were originally manually extracted. We employ materials scientists to perform a detailed manual error analysis to assess where the model struggles to faithfully extract the desired information, and draw on their insights to suggest research directions to address this broadly important task.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Scrutiny: Detecting Backdoor Attacks for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05948v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), especially those accessed via APIs, have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various domains. However, users without technical expertise often turn to (untrustworthy) third-party services, such as prompt engineering, to enhance their LLM experience, creating vulnerabilities to adversarial threats like backdoor attacks. Backdoor-compromised LLMs generate malicious outputs to users when inputs contain specific "triggers" set by attackers. Traditional defense strategies, originally designed for small-scale models, are impractical for API-accessible LLMs due to limited model access, high computational costs, and data requirements. To address these limitations, we propose Chain-of-Scrutiny (CoS) which leverages LLMs' unique reasoning abilities to mitigate backdoor attacks. It guides the LLM to generate reasoning steps for a given input and scrutinizes for consistency with the final output -- any inconsistencies indicating a potential attack. It is well-suited for the popular API-only LLM deployments, enabling detection at minimal cost and with little data. User-friendly and driven by natural language, it allows non-experts to perform the defense independently while maintaining transparency. We validate the effectiveness of CoS through extensive experiments on various tasks and LLMs, with results showing greater benefits for more powerful LLMs.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Power of Source: Source-based Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding for Neural Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11632v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maximum a posteriori decoding, a commonly used method for neural machine translation (NMT), aims to maximize the estimated posterior probability. However, high estimated probability does not always lead to high translation quality. Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding offers an alternative by seeking hypotheses with the highest expected utility.
  Inspired by Quality Estimation (QE) reranking which uses the QE model as a ranker we propose source-based MBR (sMBR) decoding, a novel approach that utilizes quasi-sources (generated via paraphrasing or back-translation) as ``support hypotheses'' and a reference-free quality estimation metric as the utility function, marking the first work to solely use sources in MBR decoding. Experiments show that sMBR outperforms QE reranking and the standard MBR decoding. Our findings suggest that sMBR is a promising approach for NMT decoding.</description>

      <title>USDC: A Dataset of $\underline{U}$ser $\underline{S}$tance and $\underline{D}$ogmatism in Long $\underline{C}$onversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing user opinion changes in long conversation threads is extremely critical for applications like enhanced personalization, market research, political campaigns, customer service, targeted advertising, and content moderation. Unfortunately, previous studies on stance and dogmatism in user conversations have focused on training models using datasets annotated at the post level, treating each post as independent and randomly sampling posts from conversation threads. Hence, first, we build a dataset for studying user opinion fluctuations in 764 long multi-user Reddit conversation threads, called USDC. USDC contains annotations for 2 tasks: i) User Stance classification, which involves labeling a user's stance in a post within a conversation on a five-point scale; ii) User Dogmatism classification, which involves labeling a user's overall opinion in the conversation on a four-point scale. Besides being time-consuming and costly, manual annotations for USDC are challenging because: 1) Conversation threads could be very long, increasing the chances of noisy annotations; and 2) Interpreting instances where a user changes their opinion within a conversation is difficult because often such transitions are subtle and not expressed explicitly. Hence, we leverage majority voting on zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot annotations from Mistral Large and GPT-4 to automate the annotation process. Human annotations on 200 test conversations achieved inter-annotator agreement scores of 0.49 for stance and 0.50 for dogmatism with these LLM annotations, indicating a reasonable level of consistency between human and LLM annotations. USDC is then used to finetune and instruction-tune multiple deployable small language models like LLaMA, Falcon and Vicuna for the stance and dogmatism classification tasks. We make the code and dataset publicly available [https://github.com/mounikamarreddy/USDC].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00449v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fully tensorial theory of hypercomplex neural networks is given. It allows neural networks to use arithmetic based on arbitrary algebras. The key point is to observe that algebra multiplication can be represented as a rank three tensor and use this tensor in every algebraic operation. This approach is attractive for neural network libraries that support effective tensorial operations. It agrees with previous implementations for four-dimensional algebras.</description>

      <title>V-RoAst: Visual Road Assessment. Can VLM be a Road Safety Assessor Using the iRAP Standard?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Road traffic crashes result in millions of deaths annually and significant economic burdens, particularly on Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). Road safety assessments traditionally rely on human-labelled data, which is labour-intensive and time-consuming. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have advanced automated road safety assessments, they typically demand large labelled datasets and often require fine-tuning for each new geographic context. This study explores whether Vision Language Models (VLMs) with zero-shot capability can overcome these limitations to serve as effective road safety assessors using the International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP) standard. Our approach, V-RoAst (Visual question answering for Road Assessment), leverages advanced VLMs, such as Gemini-1.5-flash and GPT-4o-mini, to analyse road safety attributes without requiring any labelled training data. By optimising prompt engineering and utilising crowdsourced imagery from Mapillary, V-RoAst provides a scalable, cost-effective, and automated solution for global road safety assessments. Preliminary results show that while VLMs achieve lower performance than CNN-based models, they are capable of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and show potential in predicting star ratings from crowdsourced imagery. However, their performance is poor when key visual features are absent in the imagery, emphasising the need for human labelling to address these gaps. Advancements in VLMs, alongside in-context learning such as chain-of-thought and few-shot learning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, present opportunities for improvement, making VLMs promising tools for road assessment tasks. Designed for resource-constrained stakeholders, this framework holds the potential to save lives and reduce economic burdens worldwide.

      <title>Sum of Squares Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing expressive generative models that support exact and efficient inference is a core question in probabilistic ML. Probabilistic circuits (PCs) offer a framework where this tractability-vs-expressiveness trade-off can be analyzed theoretically. Recently, squared PCs encoding subtractive mixtures via negative parameters have emerged as tractable models that can be exponentially more expressive than monotonic PCs, i.e., PCs with positive parameters only. In this paper, we provide a more precise theoretical characterization of the expressiveness relationships among these models. First, we prove that squared PCs can be less expressive than monotonic ones. Second, we formalize a novel class of PCs -- sum of squares PCs -- that can be exponentially more expressive than both squared and monotonic PCs. Around sum of squares PCs, we build an expressiveness hierarchy that allows us to precisely unify and separate different tractable model classes such as Born Machines and PSD models, and other recently introduced tractable probabilistic models by using complex parameters. Finally, we empirically show the effectiveness of sum of squares circuits in performing distribution estimation.</description>

      <title>DIAGen: Semantically Diverse Image Augmentation with Generative Models for Few-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simple data augmentation techniques, such as rotations and flips, are widely used to enhance the generalization power of computer vision models. However, these techniques often fail to modify high-level semantic attributes of a class. To address this limitation, researchers have explored generative augmentation methods like the recently proposed DA-Fusion. Despite some progress, the variations are still largely limited to textural changes, thus falling short on aspects like varied viewpoints, environment, weather conditions, or even class-level semantic attributes (eg, variations in a dog's breed). To overcome this challenge, we propose DIAGen, building upon DA-Fusion. First, we apply Gaussian noise to the embeddings of an object learned with Textual Inversion to diversify generations using a pre-trained diffusion model's knowledge. Second, we exploit the general knowledge of a text-to-text generative model to guide the image generation of the diffusion model with varied class-specific prompts. Finally, we introduce a weighting mechanism to mitigate the impact of poorly generated samples. Experimental results across various datasets show that DIAGen not only enhances semantic diversity but also improves the performance of subsequent classifiers. The advantages of DIAGen over standard augmentations and the DA-Fusion baseline are particularly pronounced with out-of-distribution samples.</description>

      <title>RSTeller: Scaling Up Visual Language Modeling in Remote Sensing with Rich Linguistic Semantics from Openly Available Data and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14744v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abundant, well-annotated multimodal data in remote sensing are pivotal for aligning complex visual remote sensing (RS) scenes with human language, enabling the development of specialized vision language models across diverse RS interpretation tasks. However, annotating RS images with rich linguistic semantics at scale demands expertise in RS and substantial human labor, making it costly and often impractical. In this study, we propose a workflow that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate multimodal datasets with semantically rich captions at scale from plain OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for images sourced from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This approach facilitates the generation of paired remote sensing data and can be readily scaled up using openly available data. Within this framework, we present RSTeller, a multimodal dataset comprising over 1.3 million RS images, each accompanied by two descriptive captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSTeller enhances the performance of multiple existing vision language models for RS scene understanding through continual pre-training. Our methodology significantly reduces the manual effort and expertise needed for annotating remote sensing imagery while democratizing access to high-quality annotated data. This advancement fosters progress in visual language modeling and encourages broader participation in remote sensing research and applications. The RSTeller dataset is available at https://github.com/SlytherinGe/RSTeller.</description>

      <title>Language Models Benefit from Preparation with Elicited Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01345v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The zero-shot chain of thought (CoT) approach is often used in question answering (QA) by language models (LMs) for tasks that require multiple reasoning steps. However, some QA tasks hinge more on accessing relevant knowledge than on chaining reasoning steps. We introduce a simple prompting technique, called PREP, that involves using two instances of LMs: the first (LM1) generates relevant information, and the second (LM2) receives the information from the user and answers the question. This design is intended to make better use of the LM's instruction-following capability. PREP is applicable across various QA tasks without domain-specific prompt engineering. PREP is developed on a dataset of 100 QA questions, derived from an extensive schematic dataset specifying artifact parts and material composition. These questions ask which of two artifacts is less likely to share materials with another artifact. Such questions probe the LM's knowledge of shared materials in the part structure of different artifacts. We test our method on our parts-and-materials dataset and three published commonsense reasoning datasets. The average accuracy of our method is consistently higher than that of all the other tested methods across all the tested datasets.</description>

      <title>vec2wav 2.0: Advancing Voice Conversion via Discrete Token Vocoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01995v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new speech discrete token vocoder, vec2wav 2.0, which advances voice conversion (VC). We use discrete tokens from speech self-supervised models as the content features of source speech, and treat VC as a prompted vocoding task. To amend the loss of speaker timbre in the content tokens, vec2wav 2.0 utilizes the WavLM features to provide strong timbre-dependent information. A novel adaptive Snake activation function is proposed to better incorporate timbre into the waveform reconstruction process. In this way, vec2wav 2.0 learns to alter the speaker timbre appropriately given different reference prompts. Also, no supervised data is required for vec2wav 2.0 to be effectively trained. Experimental results demonstrate that vec2wav 2.0 outperforms all other baselines to a considerable margin in terms of audio quality and speaker similarity in any-to-any VC. Ablation studies verify the effects made by the proposed techniques. Moreover, vec2wav 2.0 achieves competitive cross-lingual VC even only trained on monolingual corpus. Thus, vec2wav 2.0 shows timbre can potentially be manipulated only by speech token vocoders, pushing the frontiers of VC and speech synthesis.</description>

      <title>Policy Filtration for RLHF to Mitigate Noise in Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While direct policy optimization methods exist, pioneering LLMs are fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to generate better responses under the supervision of a reward model learned from preference data. One major challenge of RLHF is the inaccuracy of the intermediate reward model, especially in the tasks that requires complex reasoning for the reward model to score a response. We find that the reliability of the reward model varies across responses assigned with different rewards. This motivates us to filter the samples whose rewards may be unreliable to improve the signal-to-noise ratio during policy learning, resulting in Policy Filtration for Proximal Policy Optimization (PF-PPO). To choose a proper policy filtering strategy, we use the coefficient of determination (R2) between the rewards and actual scores on filtered samples as the metrics to help us find promising strategies since it measures how well the rewards filtered by PF-PPO indicate real performance. We provide extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of PF-PPO in code generation and math reasoning tasks. In code generation, PF-PPO achieves the state-of-the-art performance of 7-billion-parameter models on HumanEval (+7.9%), MBPP (+0.7%), and LeetCode Contest (+10.0%) which is a more challenging benchmark created by us. In math reasoning, PF-PPO yields performance increase using different reward models and benchmarks (Ape210K and CMATH). Code is available on https://github.com/swtheing/PF-PPO-RLHF.</description>

      <title>DAE-Fuse: An Adaptive Discriminative Autoencoder for Multi-Modality Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In extreme scenarios such as nighttime or low-visibility environments, achieving reliable perception is critical for applications like autonomous driving, robotics, and surveillance. Multi-modality image fusion, particularly integrating infrared imaging, offers a robust solution by combining complementary information from different modalities to enhance scene understanding and decision-making. However, current methods face significant limitations: GAN-based approaches often produce blurry images that lack fine-grained details, while AE-based methods may introduce bias toward specific modalities, leading to unnatural fusion results. To address these challenges, we propose DAE-Fuse, a novel two-phase discriminative autoencoder framework that generates sharp and natural fused images. Furthermore, We pioneer the extension of image fusion techniques from static images to the video domain while preserving temporal consistency across frames, thus advancing the perceptual capabilities required for autonomous navigation. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that DAE-Fuse achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, with superior generalizability to tasks like medical image fusion.</description>

      <title>Nteasee: Understanding Needs in AI for Health in Africa -- A Mixed-Methods Study of Expert and General Population Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12197v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) for health has the potential to significantly change and improve healthcare. However in most African countries, identifying culturally and contextually attuned approaches for deploying these solutions is not well understood. To bridge this gap, we conduct a qualitative study to investigate the best practices, fairness indicators, and potential biases to mitigate when deploying AI for health in African countries, as well as explore opportunities where artificial intelligence could make a positive impact in health. We used a mixed methods approach combining in-depth interviews (IDIs) and surveys. We conduct 1.5-2 hour long IDIs with 50 experts in health, policy, and AI across 17 countries, and through an inductive approach we conduct a qualitative thematic analysis on expert IDI responses. We administer a blinded 30-minute survey with case studies to 672 general population participants across 5 countries in Africa and analyze responses on quantitative scales, statistically comparing responses by country, age, gender, and level of familiarity with AI. We thematically summarize open-ended responses from surveys. Our results find generally positive attitudes, high levels of trust, accompanied by moderate levels of concern among general population participants for AI usage for health in Africa. This contrasts with expert responses, where major themes revolved around trust/mistrust, ethical concerns, and systemic barriers to integration, among others. This work presents the first-of-its-kind qualitative research study of the potential of AI for health in Africa from an algorithmic fairness angle, with perspectives from both experts and the general population. We hope that this work guides policymakers and drives home the need for further research and the inclusion of general population perspectives in decision-making around AI usage.</description>

      <title>Identifying Knowledge Editing Types in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient technique for updating the knowledge of large language models (LLMs), attracting increasing attention in recent years. However, there is a lack of effective measures to prevent the malicious misuse of this technique, which could lead to harmful edits in LLMs. These malicious modifications could cause LLMs to generate toxic content, misleading users into inappropriate actions. In front of this risk, we introduce a new task, $\textbf{K}$nowledge $\textbf{E}$diting $\textbf{T}$ype $\textbf{I}$dentification (KETI), aimed at identifying different types of edits in LLMs, thereby providing timely alerts to users when encountering illicit edits. As part of this task, we propose KETIBench, which includes five types of harmful edits covering the most popular toxic types, as well as one benign factual edit. We develop five classical classification models and three BERT-based models as baseline identifiers for both open-source and closed-source LLMs. Our experimental results, across 92 trials involving four models and three knowledge editing methods, demonstrate that all eight baseline identifiers achieve decent identification performance, highlighting the feasibility of identifying malicious edits in LLMs. Additional analyses reveal that the performance of the identifiers is independent of the reliability of the knowledge editing methods and exhibits cross-domain generalization, enabling the identification of edits from unknown sources. All data and code are available in https://github.com/xpq-tech/KETI.</description>

      <title>Sable: a Performant, Efficient and Scalable Sequence Model for MARL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01706v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) progresses towards solving larger and more complex problems, it becomes increasingly important that algorithms exhibit the key properties of (1) strong performance, (2) memory efficiency, and (3) scalability. In this work, we introduce Sable, a performant, memory-efficient, and scalable sequence modeling approach to MARL. Sable works by adapting the retention mechanism in Retentive Networks (Sun et al., 2023) to achieve computationally efficient processing of multi-agent observations with long context memory for temporal reasoning. Through extensive evaluations across six diverse environments, we demonstrate how Sable is able to significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in a large number of diverse tasks (34 out of 45 tested). Furthermore, Sable maintains performance as we scale the number of agents, handling environments with more than a thousand agents while exhibiting a linear increase in memory usage. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to isolate the source of Sable's performance gains and confirm its efficient computational memory usage.</description>

      <title>Identifying perturbation targets through causal differential networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying variables responsible for changes to a biological system enables applications in drug target discovery and cell engineering. Given a pair of observational and interventional datasets, the goal is to isolate the subset of observed variables that were the targets of the intervention. Directly applying causal discovery algorithms is challenging: the data may contain thousands of variables with as few as tens of samples per intervention, and biological systems do not adhere to classical causality assumptions. We propose a causality-inspired approach to address this practical setting. First, we infer noisy causal graphs from the observational and interventional data. Then, we learn to map the differences between these graphs, along with additional statistical features, to sets of variables that were intervened upon. Both modules are jointly trained in a supervised framework, on simulated and real data that reflect the nature of biological interventions. This approach consistently outperforms baselines for perturbation modeling on seven single-cell transcriptomics datasets. We also demonstrate significant improvements over current causal discovery methods for predicting soft and hard intervention targets across a variety of synthetic data.</description>

      <title>AI, Climate, and Regulation: From Data Centers to the AI Act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We live in a world that is experiencing an unprecedented boom of AI applications that increasingly penetrate and enhance all sectors of private and public life, from education, media, medicine, and mobility to the industrial and professional workspace, and -- potentially particularly consequentially -- robotics. As this world is simultaneously grappling with climate change, the climate and environmental implications of the development and use of AI have become an important subject of public and academic debate. In this paper, we aim to provide guidance on the climate-related regulation for data centers and AI specifically, and discuss how to operationalize these requirements. We also highlight challenges and room for improvement, and make a number of policy proposals to this end. In particular, we propose a specific interpretation of the AI Act to bring reporting on the previously unadressed energy consumption from AI inferences back into the scope. We also find that the AI Act fails to address indirect greenhouse gas emissions from AI applications. Furthermore, for the purpose of energy consumption reporting, we compare levels of measurement within data centers and recommend measurement at the cumulative server level. We also argue for an interpretation of the AI Act that includes environmental concerns in the mandatory risk assessment (sustainability risk assessment, SIA), and provide guidance on its operationalization. The EU data center regulation proves to be a good first step but requires further development by including binding renewable energy and efficiency targets for data centers. Overall, we make twelve concrete policy proposals, in four main areas: Energy and Environmental Reporting Obligations; Legal and Regulatory Clarifications; Transparency and Accountability Mechanisms; and Future Far-Reaching Measures beyond Transparency.</description>

      <title>PII-Scope: A Comprehensive Study on Training Data PII Extraction Attacks in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce PII-Scope, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate state-of-the-art methodologies for PII extraction attacks targeting LLMs across diverse threat settings. Our study provides a deeper understanding of these attacks by uncovering several hyperparameters (e.g., demonstration selection) crucial to their effectiveness. Building on this understanding, we extend our study to more realistic attack scenarios, exploring PII attacks that employ advanced adversarial strategies, including repeated and diverse querying, and leveraging iterative learning for continual PII extraction. Through extensive experimentation, our results reveal a notable underestimation of PII leakage in existing single-query attacks. In fact, we show that with sophisticated adversarial capabilities and a limited query budget, PII extraction rates can increase by up to fivefold when targeting the pretrained model. Moreover, we evaluate PII leakage on finetuned models, showing that they are more vulnerable to leakage than pretrained models. Overall, our work establishes a rigorous empirical benchmark for PII extraction attacks in realistic threat scenarios and provides a strong foundation for developing effective mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Stuffed Mamba: Oversized States Lead to the Inability to Forget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in recurrent architectures, such as Mamba and RWKV, have showcased strong language capabilities. Unlike transformer-based models, these architectures encode all contextual information into a fixed-size state, leading to great inference efficiency. However, this approach can cause information interference, where different token data conflicts, resulting in performance degradation and incoherent outputs beyond a certain context length. To prevent this, most RNNs incorporate mechanisms designed to "forget" earlier tokens. In this paper, we reveal that Mamba-based models struggle to effectively forget earlier tokens even with built-in forgetting mechanisms. We demonstrate that this issue stems from training on contexts that are too short for the state size, enabling the model to perform well without needing to learn how to forget. Then, we show that the minimum training length required for the model to learn forgetting scales linearly with the state size, and the maximum context length for accurate retrieval of a 5-digit passkey scales exponentially with the state size, indicating that the model retains some information beyond the point where forgetting begins. These findings highlight a critical limitation in current RNN architectures and provide valuable insights for improving long-context modeling. Our work suggests that future RNN designs must account for the interplay between state size, training length, and forgetting mechanisms to achieve robust performance in long-context tasks.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Bidirectional Interaction Model for Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a natural language expression and a remote sensing image, the goal of referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) is to generate a pixel-level mask of the target object identified by the referring expression. In contrast to natural scenarios, expressions in RRSIS often involve complex geospatial relationships, with target objects of interest that vary significantly in scale and lack visual saliency, thereby increasing the difficulty of achieving precise segmentation. To address the aforementioned challenges, a novel RRSIS framework is proposed, termed the cross-modal bidirectional interaction model (CroBIM). Specifically, a context-aware prompt modulation (CAPM) module is designed to integrate spatial positional relationships and task-specific knowledge into the linguistic features, thereby enhancing the ability to capture the target object. Additionally, a language-guided feature aggregation (LGFA) module is introduced to integrate linguistic information into multi-scale visual features, incorporating an attention deficit compensation mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. Finally, a mutual-interaction decoder (MID) is designed to enhance cross-modal feature alignment through cascaded bidirectional cross-attention, thereby enabling precise segmentation mask prediction. To further forster the research of RRSIS, we also construct RISBench, a new large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 52,472 image-language-label triplets. Extensive benchmarking on RISBench and two other prevalent datasets demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed CroBIM over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The source code for CroBIM and the RISBench dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/CroBIM</description>

      <title>Neural Solver Selection for Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has increasingly been employed to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, resulting in the emergence of neural solvers that demonstrate remarkable performance, even with minimal domain-specific knowledge. To date, the community has created numerous open-source neural solvers with distinct motivations and inductive biases. While considerable efforts are devoted to designing powerful single solvers, our findings reveal that existing solvers typically demonstrate complementary performance across different problem instances. This suggests that significant improvements could be achieved through effective coordination of neural solvers at the instance level. In this work, we propose the first general framework to coordinate the neural solvers, which involves feature extraction, selection model, and selection strategy, aiming to allocate each instance to the most suitable solvers. To instantiate, we collect several typical neural solvers with state-of-the-art performance as alternatives, and explore various methods for each component of the framework. We evaluated our framework on two extensively studied combinatorial optimization problems, Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). Experimental results show that the proposed framework can effectively distribute instances and the resulting composite solver can achieve significantly better performance (e.g., reduce the optimality gap by 0.88\% on TSPLIB and 0.71\% on CVRPLIB) than the best individual neural solver with little extra time cost.</description>

      <title>LLMs know their vulnerabilities: Uncover Safety Gaps through Natural Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safety concerns in large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their exposure to potentially harmful data during pre-training. In this paper, we identify a new safety vulnerability in LLMs: their susceptibility to \textit{natural distribution shifts} between attack prompts and original toxic prompts, where seemingly benign prompts, semantically related to harmful content, can bypass safety mechanisms. To explore this issue, we introduce a novel attack method, \textit{ActorBreaker}, which identifies actors related to toxic prompts within pre-training distribution to craft multi-turn prompts that gradually lead LLMs to reveal unsafe content. ActorBreaker is grounded in Latour's actor-network theory, encompassing both human and non-human actors to capture a broader range of vulnerabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that ActorBreaker outperforms existing attack methods in terms of diversity, effectiveness, and efficiency across aligned LLMs. To address this vulnerability, we propose expanding safety training to cover a broader semantic space of toxic content. We thus construct a multi-turn safety dataset using ActorBreaker. Fine-tuning models on our dataset shows significant improvements in robustness, though with some trade-offs in utility. Code is available at https://github.com/AI45Lab/ActorAttack.</description>

      <title>Reversal of Thought: Enhancing Large Language Models with Preference-Guided Reverse Reasoning Warm-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in reasoning tasks but face limitations in mathematical and complex logical reasoning. Existing methods to improve LLMs' logical capabilities either involve traceable or verifiable logical sequences that generate more reliable responses by constructing logical structures yet increase computational costs, or introduces rigid logic template rules, reducing flexibility. In this paper, we propose Reversal of Thought (RoT), a plug-and-play and cost-effective reasoning framework designed to enhance the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs during the warm-up phase prior to batch inference. RoT utilizes a Preference-Guided Reverse Reasoning warm-up strategy, which integrates logical symbols for pseudocode planning through meta-cognitive mechanisms and pairwise preference self-evaluation to generate task-specific prompts solely through demonstrations, aligning with LLMs' cognitive preferences shaped by RLHF. Through reverse reasoning, we utilize a Cognitive Preference Manager to assess knowledge boundaries and further expand LLMs' reasoning capabilities by aggregating solution logic for known tasks and stylistic templates for unknown tasks. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate that RoT surpasses existing baselines in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Conformity in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conformity effect describes the tendency of individuals to align their responses with the majority. Studying this bias in large language models (LLMs) is crucial, as LLMs are increasingly used in various information-seeking and decision-making tasks as conversation partners to improve productivity. Thus, conformity to incorrect responses can compromise their effectiveness. In this paper, we adapt psychological experiments to examine the extent of conformity in popular LLMs. Our findings reveal that all tested models exhibit varying levels of conformity toward the majority, regardless of their initial choice or correctness, across different knowledge domains. Notably, we are the first to show that LLMs are more likely to conform when they are more uncertain in their own prediction. We further explore factors that influence conformity, such as training paradigms and input characteristics, finding that instruction-tuned models are less susceptible to conformity, while increasing the naturalness of majority tones amplifies conformity. Finally, we propose two interventions, Devil's Advocate and Question Distillation, to mitigate conformity, providing insights into building more robust language models.</description>

      <title>Stable Object Placement Planning From Contact Point Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a planner designed to guide robot manipulators in stably placing objects within intricate scenes. Our proposed method reverses the traditional approach to object placement: our planner selects contact points first and then determines a placement pose that solicits the selected points. This is instead of sampling poses, identifying contact points, and evaluating pose quality. Our algorithm facilitates stability-aware object placement planning, imposing no restrictions on object shape, convexity, or mass density homogeneity, while avoiding combinatorial computational complexity. Our proposed stability heuristic enables our planner to find a solution about 20 times faster when compared to the same algorithm not making use of the heuristic and eight times faster than a state-of-the-art method that uses the traditional sample-and-evaluate approach. Our proposed planner is also more successful in finding stable placements than the five other benchmarked algorithms. Derived from first principles and validated in ten real robot experiments, our planner offers a general and scalable method to tackle the problem of object placement planning with rigid objects.</description>

      <title>SynapticRAG: Enhancing Temporal Memory Retrieval in Large Language Models through Synaptic Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing retrieval methods in Large Language Models show degradation in accuracy when handling temporally distributed conversations, primarily due to their reliance on simple similarity-based retrieval. Unlike existing memory retrieval methods that rely solely on semantic similarity, we propose SynapticRAG, which uniquely combines temporal association triggers with biologically-inspired synaptic propagation mechanisms. Our approach uses temporal association triggers and synaptic-like stimulus propagation to identify relevant dialogue histories. A dynamic leaky integrate-and-fire mechanism then selects the most contextually appropriate memories. Experiments on four datasets of English, Chinese and Japanese show that compared to state-of-the-art memory retrieval methods, SynapticRAG achieves consistent improvements across multiple metrics up to 14.66% points. This work bridges the gap between cognitive science and language model development, providing a new framework for memory management in conversational systems.</description>

      <title>Text-Guided Multi-Property Molecular Optimization with a Diffusion Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular optimization (MO) is a crucial stage in drug discovery in which task-oriented generated molecules are optimized to meet practical industrial requirements. Existing mainstream MO approaches primarily utilize external property predictors to guide iterative property optimization. However, learning all molecular samples in the vast chemical space is unrealistic for predictors. As a result, errors and noise are inevitably introduced during property prediction due to the nature of approximation. This leads to discrepancy accumulation, generalization reduction and suboptimal molecular candidates. In this paper, we propose a text-guided multi-property molecular optimization method utilizing transformer-based diffusion language model (TransDLM). TransDLM leverages standardized chemical nomenclature as semantic representations of molecules and implicitly embeds property requirements into textual descriptions, thereby mitigating error propagation during diffusion process. By fusing physically and chemically detailed textual semantics with specialized molecular representations, TransDLM effectively integrates diverse information sources to guide precise optimization, which enhances the model's ability to balance structural retention and property enhancement. Additionally, the success of a case study further demonstrates TransDLM's ability to solve practical problems. Experimentally, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in maintaining molecular structural similarity and enhancing chemical properties on the benchmark dataset.

      <title>Influence Functions for Scalable Data Attribution in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13850v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have led to significant advancements in generative modelling. Yet their widespread adoption poses challenges regarding data attribution and interpretability. In this paper, we aim to help address such challenges in diffusion models by developing an influence functions framework. Influence function-based data attribution methods approximate how a model's output would have changed if some training data were removed. In supervised learning, this is usually used for predicting how the loss on a particular example would change. For diffusion models, we focus on predicting the change in the probability of generating a particular example via several proxy measurements. We show how to formulate influence functions for such quantities and how previously proposed methods can be interpreted as particular design choices in our framework. To ensure scalability of the Hessian computations in influence functions, we systematically develop K-FAC approximations based on generalised Gauss-Newton matrices specifically tailored to diffusion models. We recast previously proposed methods as specific design choices in our framework and show that our recommended method outperforms previous data attribution approaches on common evaluations, such as the Linear Data-modelling Score (LDS) or retraining without top influences, without the need for method-specific hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>AutoMIR: Effective Zero-Shot Medical Information Retrieval without Relevance Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical information retrieval (MIR) is essential for retrieving relevant medical knowledge from diverse sources, including electronic health records, scientific literature, and medical databases. However, achieving effective zero-shot dense retrieval in the medical domain poses substantial challenges due to the lack of relevance-labeled data. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{L}earning \textbf{Hy}pothetical \textbf{D}ocument \textbf{E}mbeddings (\textbf{SL-HyDE}) to tackle this issue. SL-HyDE leverages large language models (LLMs) as generators to generate hypothetical documents based on a given query. These generated documents encapsulate key medical context, guiding a dense retriever in identifying the most relevant documents. The self-learning framework progressively refines both pseudo-document generation and retrieval, utilizing unlabeled medical corpora without requiring any relevance-labeled data. Additionally, we present the Chinese Medical Information Retrieval Benchmark (CMIRB), a comprehensive evaluation framework grounded in real-world medical scenarios, encompassing five tasks and ten datasets. By benchmarking ten models on CMIRB, we establish a rigorous standard for evaluating medical information retrieval systems. Experimental results demonstrate that SL-HyDE significantly surpasses HyDE in retrieval accuracy while showcasing strong generalization and scalability across various LLM and retriever configurations.

      <title>Interacting Large Language Model Agents. Interpretable Models and Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the theory and algorithms for interacting large language model agents (LLMAs) using methods from statistical signal processing and microeconomics. While both fields are mature, their application to decision-making involving interacting LLMAs remains unexplored. Motivated by Bayesian sentiment analysis on online platforms, we construct interpretable models and algorithms that enable LLMAs to interact and perform Bayesian inference. Because interacting LLMAs learn from both prior decisions and external inputs, they can exhibit bias and herding behavior. Thus, developing interpretable models and stochastic control algorithms is essential to understand and mitigate these behaviors. This paper has three main results. First, we show using Bayesian revealed preferences from microeconomics that an individual LLMA satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions for rationally inattentive (bounded rationality) Bayesian utility maximization and, given an observation, the LLMA chooses an action that maximizes a regularized utility. Second, we utilize Bayesian social learning to construct interpretable models for LLMAs that interact sequentially with each other and the environment while performing Bayesian inference. Our proposed models capture the herding behavior exhibited by interacting LLMAs. Third, we propose a stochastic control framework to delay herding and improve state estimation accuracy under 2 settings: (a) centrally controlled LLMAs (b) autonomous LLMAs with incentives. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on real datasets for hate speech classification and product quality assessment, using open-source models like LLaMA and closed-source models like ChatGPT. The main takeaway of this paper, based on empirical analysis and mathematical formalism, is that LLMAs act as rationally bounded Bayesian agents that exhibit social learning when interacting.</description>

      <title>Best-Arm Identification in Unimodal Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fixed-confidence best-arm identification problem in unimodal bandits, in which the means of the arms increase with the index of the arm up to their maximum, then decrease. We derive two lower bounds on the stopping time of any algorithm. The instance-dependent lower bound suggests that due to the unimodal structure, only three arms contribute to the leading confidence-dependent cost. However, a worst-case lower bound shows that a linear dependence on the number of arms is unavoidable in the confidence-independent cost. We propose modifications of Track-and-Stop and a Top Two algorithm that leverage the unimodal structure. Both versions of Track-and-Stop are asymptotically optimal for one-parameter exponential families. The Top Two algorithm is asymptotically near-optimal for Gaussian distributions and we prove a non-asymptotic guarantee matching the worse-case lower bound. The algorithms can be implemented efficiently and we demonstrate their competitive empirical performance.</description>

      <title>Regress, Don't Guess -- A Regression-like Loss on Number Tokens for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While language models have exceptional capabilities at text generation, they lack a natural inductive bias for emitting numbers and thus struggle in tasks involving quantitative reasoning, especially arithmetic. One fundamental limitation is the nature of the Cross Entropy loss, which assumes a nominal scale and thus cannot convey proximity between generated number tokens. In response, we here present a regression-like loss that operates purely on token level. Our proposed Number Token Loss (NTL) comes in two flavors and minimizes either the Lp norm or the Wasserstein distance between the numerical values of the real and predicted number tokens. NTL can easily be added to any language model and extend the Cross Entropy objective during training without runtime overhead. We evaluate the proposed scheme on various mathematical datasets and find that it consistently improves performance in math-related tasks. In a direct comparison on a regression task, we find that NTL can match the performance of a regression head, despite operating on token level. Finally, we scale NTL up to 3B parameter models and observe improved performance, demonstrating its potential for seamless integration into LLMs. We hope that this work can inspire LLM developers to improve their pretraining objectives.

      <title>ImageRAG: Enhancing Ultra High Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery Analysis with ImageRAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07688v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra High Resolution (UHR) remote sensing imagery (RSI) (e.g. 100,000 $\times$ 100,000 pixels or more) poses a significant challenge for current Remote Sensing Multimodal Large Language Models (RSMLLMs). If choose to resize the UHR image to standard input image size, the extensive spatial and contextual information that UHR images contain will be neglected. Otherwise, the original size of these images often exceeds the token limits of standard RSMLLMs, making it difficult to process the entire image and capture long-range dependencies to answer the query based on the abundant visual context. In this paper, we introduce ImageRAG for RS, a training-free framework to address the complexities of analyzing UHR remote sensing imagery. By transforming UHR remote sensing image analysis task to image's long context selection task, we design an innovative image contextual retrieval mechanism based on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, denoted as ImageRAG. ImageRAG's core innovation lies in its ability to selectively retrieve and focus on the most relevant portions of the UHR image as visual contexts that pertain to a given query. Fast path and slow path are proposed in this framework to handle this task efficiently and effectively. ImageRAG allows RSMLLMs to manage extensive context and spatial information from UHR RSI, ensuring the analysis is both accurate and efficient. Codebase will be released in https://github.com/om-ai-lab/ImageRAG</description>

      <title>Robust multi-coil MRI reconstruction via self-supervised denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12919v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of incorporating self-supervised denoising as a pre-processing step for training deep learning (DL) based reconstruction methods on data corrupted by Gaussian noise. K-space data employed for training are typically multi-coil and inherently noisy. Although DL-based reconstruction methods trained on fully sampled data can enable high reconstruction quality, obtaining large, noise-free datasets is impractical. We leverage Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (GSURE) for denoising. We evaluate two DL-based reconstruction methods: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Model-Based Deep Learning (MoDL). We evaluate the impact of denoising on the performance of these DL-based methods in solving accelerated multi-coil magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. The experiments were carried out on T2-weighted brain and fat-suppressed proton-density knee scans. We observed that self-supervised denoising enhances the quality and efficiency of MRI reconstructions across various scenarios. Specifically, employing denoised images rather than noisy counterparts when training DL networks results in lower normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE), higher structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) across different SNR levels, including 32dB, 22dB, and 12dB for T2-weighted brain data, and 24dB, 14dB, and 4dB for fat-suppressed knee data. Overall, we showed that denoising is an essential pre-processing technique capable of improving the efficacy of DL-based MRI reconstruction methods under diverse conditions. By refining the quality of input data, denoising enables training more effective DL networks, potentially bypassing the need for noise-free reference MRI scans.</description>

      <title>On the Fairness, Diversity and Reliability of Text-to-Image Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of multimodal generative models has sparked critical discussions on their reliability, fairness and potential for misuse. While text-to-image models excel at producing high-fidelity, user-guided content, they often exhibit unpredictable behaviors and vulnerabilities that can be exploited to manipulate class or concept representations. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework to assess model reliability by analyzing responses to global and local perturbations in the embedding space, enabling the identification of inputs that trigger unreliable or biased behavior. Beyond social implications, fairness and diversity are fundamental to defining robust and trustworthy model behavior. Our approach offers deeper insights into these essential aspects by evaluating: (i) generative diversity, measuring the breadth of visual representations for learned concepts, and (ii) generative fairness, which examines the impact that removing concepts from input prompts has on control, under a low guidance setup. Beyond these evaluations, our method lays the groundwork for detecting unreliable, bias-injected models and tracing the provenance of embedded biases. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/JJ-Vice/T2I_Fairness_Diversity_Reliability.

      <title>FuseGPT: Learnable Layers Fusion of Generative Pre-trained Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse domains, largely due to the extensive scaling of model parameters. Recent works have observed redundancy within transformer blocks and developed compression methods by structured pruning of less important blocks. However, such direct removal often leads to irreversible performance degradation. In this paper, we propose FuseGPT, a novel methodology designed to recycle pruned transformer blocks, thereby recovering the model's performance. Firstly, we introduce a new importance detection metric, Macro Influence (MI), which evaluates the long-term impact of each transformer block by quantifying the information loss incurred upon its removal. Next, we propose group-level layer fusion, which leverages the parameters from layers of less important blocks and integrates them into the corresponding layers of neighboring blocks. This fusion process is not a one-time operation but is refined through iterative parameter updates by lightweight group-level fine-tuning. Specifically, the injected parameters are frozen but are weighted with learnable rank decomposition matrices to reduce the computational overhead during fine-tuning. Our approach not only works well for large language models but also for large multimodal models. Experimental results indicate that, even with modest amounts of data, FuseGPT surpasses previous methods in both perplexity and zero-shot task performance.</description>

      <title>Is Training Data Quality or Quantity More Impactful to Small Language Model Performance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the relative impact of training data quality versus quantity on the performance of small language models (SLMs), utilizing the TinyStories dataset for empirical analysis. Analysis of dataset variations with respect to size (25% and 50% of the original size) and duplication (controlled rates of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) were performed. Model performance was evaluated based on the validation loss, accuracy, and perplexity metrics. Results indicate training data quality plays a more significant role in the overall performance of SLMs, especially given scale of this experiment. Minimal duplication positively impacted model accuracy (+0.87% increase in accuracy at 25% duplication) without significantly increasing perplexity (+0.52% increase going from 0% to 25% duplication) but excessive duplication led to pronounced performance degradation (-40% drop in accuracy at 100% duplication). The implications of this exploration extend beyond just model performance; training large-scale models imposes significant financial and computational burdens, which can be prohibitive for organizations, individuals, and the public at large, especially in developing countries. Additionally, the energy consumption associated with large-scale training raises environmental concerns. Understanding the relative importance of data quality versus quantity could democratize AI technology, making advanced models more accessible and sustainable for all.</description>

      <title>Federated Continual Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of big data, managing evolving graph data poses substantial challenges due to storage costs and privacy issues. Training graph neural networks (GNNs) on such evolving data usually causes catastrophic forgetting, impairing performance on earlier tasks. Despite existing continual graph learning (CGL) methods mitigating this to some extent, they rely on centralized architectures and ignore the potential of distributed graph databases to leverage collective intelligence. To address these challenges, we present a pioneering study on Federated Continual Graph Learning (FCGL), which adapts GNNs to multiple evolving graphs within decentralized settings while adhering to storage and privacy constraints. Our work begins with a comprehensive empirical analysis of FCGL, assessing its data characteristics, feasibility, and effectiveness, and reveals two non-trivial challenges: local graph forgetting (LGF), where local GNNs forget prior knowledge when adapting to new tasks, and global expertise conflict (GEC), where the global GNN exhibits sub-optimal performance in both adapting to new tasks and retaining old ones, arising from inconsistent client expertise during server-side parameter aggregation. To tackle these, we propose the POWER framework, which mitigates LGF by preserving and replaying experience nodes with maximum local-global coverage at each client and addresses GEC by using a pseudo prototype reconstruction strategy and trajectory-aware knowledge transfer at the central server. Experiments on various graph datasets demonstrate POWER's superiority over federated adaptations of CGL baselines and vision-centric federated continual learning approaches.</description>

      <title>HiMoE: Heterogeneity-Informed Mixture-of-Experts for Fair Spatial-Temporal Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving both accurate and consistent predictive performance across spatial nodes is crucial for ensuring the validity and reliability of outcomes in fair spatial-temporal forecasting tasks. However, existing training methods treat heterogeneous nodes with a fully averaged perspective, resulting in inherently biased prediction targets. Balancing accuracy and consistency is particularly challenging due to the multi-objective nature of spatial-temporal forecasting. To address this issue, we propose a novel Heterogeneity-Informed Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) framework that delivers both uniform and precise spatial-temporal predictions. From a model architecture perspective, we design the Heterogeneity-Informed Graph Convolutional Network (HiGCN) to address trend heterogeneity, and we introduce the Node-wise Mixture-of-Experts (NMoE) module to handle cardinality heterogeneity across nodes. From an evaluation perspective, we propose STFairBench, a benchmark that handles fairness in spatial-temporal prediction from both training and evaluation stages. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that HiMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baseline by at least 9.22% across all evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>LiDAR-EDIT: LiDAR Data Generation by Editing the Object Layouts in Real-World Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present LiDAR-EDIT, a novel paradigm for generating synthetic LiDAR data for autonomous driving. Our framework edits real-world LiDAR scans by introducing new object layouts while preserving the realism of the background environment. Compared to end-to-end frameworks that generate LiDAR point clouds from scratch, LiDAR-EDIT offers users full control over the object layout, including the number, type, and pose of objects, while keeping most of the original real-world background. Our method also provides object labels for the generated data. Compared to novel view synthesis techniques, our framework allows for the creation of counterfactual scenarios with object layouts significantly different from the original real-world scene. LiDAR-EDIT uses spherical voxelization to enforce correct LiDAR projective geometry in the generated point clouds by construction. During object removal and insertion, generative models are employed to fill the unseen background and object parts that were occluded in the original real LiDAR scans. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework produces realistic LiDAR scans with practical value for downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Augmenting the action space with conventions to improve multi-agent cooperation in Hanabi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The card game Hanabi is considered a strong medium for the testing and development of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, due to its cooperative nature, partial observability, limited communication and remarkable complexity. Previous research efforts have explored the capabilities of MARL algorithms within Hanabi, focusing largely on advanced architecture design and algorithmic manipulations to achieve state-of-the-art performance for various number of cooperators. However, this often leads to complex solution strategies with high computational cost and requiring large amounts of training data. For humans to solve the Hanabi game effectively, they require the use of conventions, which often allows for a means to implicitly convey ideas or knowledge based on a predefined, and mutually agreed upon, set of "rules" or principles. Multi-agent problems containing partial observability, especially when limited communication is present, can benefit greatly from the use of implicit knowledge sharing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to augmenting an agent's action space using conventions, which act as a sequence of special cooperative actions that span over and include multiple time steps and multiple agents, requiring agents to actively opt in for it to reach fruition. These conventions are based on existing human conventions, and result in a significant improvement on the performance of existing techniques for self-play and cross-play for various number of cooperators within Hanabi.</description>

      <title>HARP: Hesitation-Aware Reframing in Transformer Inference Pass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to improve the performance of large language models by addressing the variable computational demands in inference steps, where some tokens require more computational resources than others. We present HARP, a simple modification to "off-the-shelf" Transformer forward pass. Drawing from hesitation and the framing effect in decision-making, HARP selectively applies additional computation when the model encounters uncertainty during token generation. Our method mimics human cognitive processes by pausing at difficult decision points and reframing inputs for a different perspective. Unlike other approaches, HARP is model-agnostic, training-free, and easy to implement. We evaluate our method across various downstream tasks and model sizes, demonstrating performance improvements up to +5.16%. Notably, HARP achieves these gains while maintaining inference times twice faster than beam search. Simple and yet with significant gains, HARP provides insights into the potential of adaptive computation for enhancing the performance of Transformer-based language models.</description>

      <title>LinGen: Towards High-Resolution Minute-Length Text-to-Video Generation with Linear Computational Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-video generation enhances content creation but is highly computationally intensive: The computational cost of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) scales quadratically in the number of pixels. This makes minute-length video generation extremely expensive, limiting most existing models to generating videos of only 10-20 seconds length. We propose a Linear-complexity text-to-video Generation (LinGen) framework whose cost scales linearly in the number of pixels. For the first time, LinGen enables high-resolution minute-length video generation on a single GPU without compromising quality. It replaces the computationally-dominant and quadratic-complexity block, self-attention, with a linear-complexity block called MATE, which consists of an MA-branch and a TE-branch. The MA-branch targets short-to-long-range correlations, combining a bidirectional Mamba2 block with our token rearrangement method, Rotary Major Scan, and our review tokens developed for long video generation. The TE-branch is a novel TEmporal Swin Attention block that focuses on temporal correlations between adjacent tokens and medium-range tokens. The MATE block addresses the adjacency preservation issue of Mamba and improves the consistency of generated videos significantly. Experimental results show that LinGen outperforms DiT (with a 75.6% win rate) in video quality with up to 15$\times$ (11.5$\times$) FLOPs (latency) reduction. Furthermore, both automatic metrics and human evaluation demonstrate our LinGen-4B yields comparable video quality to state-of-the-art models (with a 50.5%, 52.1%, 49.1% win rate with respect to Gen-3, LumaLabs, and Kling, respectively). This paves the way to hour-length movie generation and real-time interactive video generation. We provide 68s video generation results and more examples in our project website: https://lineargen.github.io/.</description>

      <title>ROUTE: Robust Multitask Tuning and Collaboration for Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the significant advancements in Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) facilitated by large language models (LLMs), the latest state-of-the-art techniques are still trapped in the in-context learning of closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), which limits their applicability in open scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel RObust mUltitask Tuning and collaboration mEthod (ROUTE) to improve the comprehensive capabilities of open-source LLMs for Text2SQL, thereby providing a more practical solution. Our approach begins with multi-task supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using various synthetic training data related to SQL generation. Unlike existing SFT-based Text2SQL methods, we introduced several additional SFT tasks, including schema linking, noise correction, and continuation writing. Engaging in a variety of SQL generation tasks enhances the model's understanding of SQL syntax and improves its ability to generate high-quality SQL queries. Additionally, inspired by the collaborative modes of LLM agents, we introduce a Multitask Collaboration Prompting (MCP) strategy. This strategy leverages collaboration across several SQL-related tasks to reduce hallucinations during SQL generation, thereby maximizing the potential of enhancing Text2SQL performance through explicit multitask capabilities. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses have been performed on eight open-source LLMs and five widely-used benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our proposal outperforms the latest Text2SQL methods and yields leading performance.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Chain-of-Thought from the Perspective of Self-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10827v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as an effective approach for activating latent capabilities in LLMs. Interestingly, we observe that both CoT reasoning and self-training share the core objective: iteratively leveraging model-generated information to progressively reduce prediction uncertainty. Building on this insight, we propose a novel CoT framework to improve reasoning performance. Our framework integrates two key components: (i) a task-specific prompt module that optimizes the initial reasoning process, and (ii) an adaptive reasoning iteration module that dynamically refines the reasoning process and addresses the limitations of previous CoT approaches, \ie over-reasoning and high similarity between consecutive reasoning iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant advantages in both performance and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Segment-Level Diffusion: A Framework for Controllable Long-Form Generation with Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown promise in text generation, but often struggle with generating long, coherent, and contextually accurate text. Token-level diffusion doesn't model word-order dependencies explicitly and operates on short, fixed output windows, while passage-level diffusion struggles with learning robust representations for long-form text. To address these challenges, we propose Segment-Level Diffusion (SLD), a framework that enhances diffusion-based text generation through text segmentation, robust representation training with adversarial and contrastive learning, and improved latent-space guidance. By segmenting long-form outputs into multiple latent representations and decoding them with an autoregressive decoder, SLD simplifies diffusion predictions and improves scalability. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate that, when compared to other diffusion and autoregressive baselines SLD achieves competitive or superior fluency, coherence, and contextual compatibility in automatic and human evaluations.</description>

      <title>What External Knowledge is Preferred by LLMs? Characterizing and Exploring Chain of Evidence in Imperfect Context for Multi-Hop QA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating external knowledge has emerged as a promising way to mitigate outdated knowledge and hallucinations in LLM. However, external knowledge is often imperfect, encompassing substantial extraneous or even inaccurate content, which interferes with the LLM's utilization of useful knowledge in the context. This paper seeks to characterize the features of preferred external knowledge and perform empirical studies in imperfect contexts. Inspired by the chain of evidence (CoE), we characterize that the knowledge preferred by LLMs should maintain both relevance to the question and mutual support among the textual pieces. Accordingly, we propose a CoE discrimination approach and conduct a comparative analysis between CoE and Non-CoE samples across significance, deceptiveness, and robustness, revealing the LLM's preference for external knowledge that aligns with CoE features. Furthermore, we selected three representative tasks (RAG-based multi-hop QA, external knowledge poisoning and poisoning defense), along with corresponding SOTA or prevalent baselines. By integrating CoE features, the variants achieved significant improvements over the original baselines.</description>

      <title>EscapeBench: Towards Advancing Creative Intelligence of Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language model agents excel in long-session planning and reasoning, but existing benchmarks primarily focus on goal-oriented tasks with explicit objectives, neglecting creative adaptation in unfamiliar environments. To address this, we introduce EscapeBench, a benchmark suite of room escape game environments designed to challenge agents with creative reasoning, unconventional tool use, and iterative problem-solving to uncover implicit goals. Our results show that current LM models, despite employing working memory and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, achieve only 15% average progress without hints, highlighting their limitations in creativity. To bridge this gap, we propose EscapeAgent, a framework designed to enhance creative reasoning through Foresight (innovative tool use) and Reflection (identifying unsolved tasks). Experiments show that EscapeAgent can execute action chains over 1,000 steps while maintaining logical coherence. It navigates and completes games with up to 40% fewer steps and hints, performs robustly across difficulty levels, and achieves higher action success rates with more efficient and innovative puzzle-solving strategies.</description>

      <title>Faster and Stronger: When ANN-SNN Conversion Meets Parallel Spiking Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Network (SNN), as a brain-inspired and energy-efficient network, is currently facing the pivotal challenge of exploring a suitable and efficient learning framework. The predominant training methodologies, namely Spatial-Temporal Back-propagation (STBP) and ANN-SNN Conversion, are encumbered by substantial training overhead or pronounced inference latency, which impedes the advancement of SNNs in scaling to larger networks and navigating intricate application domains. In this work, we propose a novel parallel conversion learning framework, which establishes a mathematical mapping relationship between each time-step of the parallel spiking neurons and the cumulative spike firing rate. We theoretically validate the lossless and sorting properties of the conversion process, as well as pointing out the optimal shifting distance for each step. Furthermore, by integrating the above framework with the distribution-aware error calibration technique, we can achieve efficient conversion towards more general activation functions or training-free circumstance. Extensive experiments have confirmed the significant performance advantages of our method for various conversion cases under ultra-low time latency. To our best knowledge, this is the first work which jointly utilizes parallel spiking calculation and ANN-SNN Conversion, providing a highly promising approach for SNN supervised training.

      <title>Crabs: Consuming Resource via Auto-generation for LLM-DoS Attack under Black-box Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13879v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks yet still are vulnerable to external threats, particularly LLM Denial-of-Service (LLM-DoS) attacks. Specifically, LLM-DoS attacks aim to exhaust computational resources and block services. However, existing studies predominantly focus on white-box attacks, leaving black-box scenarios underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Auto-Generation for LLM-DoS (AutoDoS) attack, an automated algorithm designed for black-box LLMs. AutoDoS constructs the DoS Attack Tree and expands the node coverage to achieve effectiveness under black-box conditions. By transferability-driven iterative optimization, AutoDoS could work across different models in one prompt. Furthermore, we reveal that embedding the Length Trojan allows AutoDoS to bypass existing defenses more effectively. Experimental results show that AutoDoS significantly amplifies service response latency by over 250$\times\uparrow$, leading to severe resource consumption in terms of GPU utilization and memory usage. Our work provides a new perspective on LLM-DoS attacks and security defenses. Our code is available at https://github.com/shuita2333/AutoDoS.</description>

      <title>How to Synthesize Text Data without Model Collapse?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model collapse in synthetic data indicates that iterative training on self-generated data leads to a gradual decline in performance. With the proliferation of AI models, synthetic data will fundamentally reshape the web data ecosystem. Future GPT-$\{n\}$ models will inevitably be trained on a blend of synthetic and human-produced data. In this paper, we focus on two questions: what is the impact of synthetic data on language model training, and how to synthesize data without model collapse? We first pre-train language models across different proportions of synthetic data, revealing a negative correlation between the proportion of synthetic data and model performance. We further conduct statistical analysis on synthetic data to uncover distributional shift phenomenon and over-concentration of n-gram features. Inspired by the above findings, we propose token editing on human-produced data to obtain semi-synthetic data. As a proof of concept, we theoretically demonstrate that token-level editing can prevent model collapse, as the test error is constrained by a finite upper bound. We conduct extensive experiments on pre-training from scratch, continual pre-training, and supervised fine-tuning. The results validate our theoretical proof that token-level editing improves model performance.</description>

      <title>GMoE: Empowering LLMs Fine-Tuning via MoE Graph Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture of large language models (LLMs) confronts an inherent issue of load imbalance arising from the simplistic linear router strategy, which ultimately causes the instability and inefficient learning of LLMs. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel MoE graph-based framework $\textbf{GMoE}$, aimed at enhancing the collaboration among multiple experts. In GMoE, a graph router function is designed to capture the collaboration signals among experts. This enables all experts to dynamically allocate information derived from input data by sharing information with their neighboring experts. Moreover, we put forward two coordination strategies in GMoE: the $\textit{Poisson distribution-based distinction strategy}$ and the $\textit{Normal distribution-based balance strategy}$, to further release the capacity of each expert and increase the model stability in the fine-tuning of LLMs. Specifically, we leverage a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, i.e., Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to implement the graph MoE architecture. Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GMoE, showing the benefits of facilitating collaborations of multiple experts in LLM fine-tuning.

      <title>FairREAD: Re-fusing Demographic Attributes after Disentanglement for Fair Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have shown transformative potential in medical imaging, yet concerns about fairness persist due to performance disparities across demographic subgroups. Existing methods aim to address these biases by mitigating sensitive attributes in image data; however, these attributes often carry clinically relevant information, and their removal can compromise model performance-a highly undesirable outcome. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Re-fusion After Disentanglement (FairREAD), a novel, simple, and efficient framework that mitigates unfairness by re-integrating sensitive demographic attributes into fair image representations. FairREAD employs orthogonality constraints and adversarial training to disentangle demographic information while using a controlled re-fusion mechanism to preserve clinically relevant details. Additionally, subgroup-specific threshold adjustments ensure equitable performance across demographic groups. Comprehensive evaluations on a large-scale clinical X-ray dataset demonstrate that FairREAD significantly reduces unfairness metrics while maintaining diagnostic accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for fairness and performance in medical image classification.</description>

      <title>Towards Graph Foundation Models: Learning Generalities Across Graphs via Task-Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models are pretrained on large-scale corpora to learn generalizable patterns across domains and tasks -- such as contours, textures, and edges in images, or tokens and sentences in text. In contrast, discovering such generalities in graph-structured data, especially across heterogeneous graph tasks, remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose a novel approach to cross-task generalization in graphs via task-trees, which serve as unified learning instances aligning node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks. We theoretically analyze the stability, transferability, and generalization properties of task-trees, showing that pretraining a graph neural network (GNN) on diverse task-trees with a reconstruction objective induces transferable knowledge. This enables efficient adaptation to downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. To validate our framework, we introduce Graph Generality Identifier on Task-Trees (GIT), a graph foundation model that demonstrates strong performance on over 30 graphs across five domains via fine-tuning, in-context learning, and zero-shot generalization. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/GIT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large language models provide significant convenience for software development, they can lead to ethical issues in job interviews and student assignments. Therefore, determining whether a piece of code is written by a human or generated by an artificial intelligence (AI) model is a critical issue. In this study, we present AIGCodeSet, which consists of 2.828 AI-generated and 4.755 human-written Python codes, created using CodeLlama 34B, Codestral 22B, and Gemini 1.5 Flash. In addition, we share the results of our experiments conducted with baseline detection methods. Our experiments show that a Bayesian classifier outperforms the other models.</description>

      <title>A partition cover approach to tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tokenization is the process of encoding strings into tokens of a fixed vocabulary size, and is widely utilized in Natural Language Processing applications. The leading tokenization algorithm today is Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), which formulates the tokenization problem as a compression problem and tackles it by performing sequences of merges. In this work, we formulate tokenization as an optimization objective, show that it is NP-hard via a simple reduction from vertex cover, and propose a polynomial-time greedy algorithm GreedTok. Our formulation naturally relaxes to the well-studied weighted maximum coverage problem which has a simple $(1 - 1/e)$-approximation algorithm GreedWMC. Through empirical evaluations on real-world corpora, we show that GreedTok outperforms BPE and Unigram on compression and achieves a covering score comparable to GreedWMC. Finally, our extensive pre-training for two transformer-based language models with 1 billion parameters, comparing the choices of BPE and GreedTok as the tokenizer, shows that GreedTok achieves a lower bit per byte even when we control for either the total dataset proportion or total training tokens.</description>

      <title>The Invisible Hand: Unveiling Provider Bias in Large Language Models for Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as the new recommendation engines, surpassing traditional methods in both capability and scope, particularly in code generation. In this paper, we reveal a novel provider bias in LLMs: without explicit directives, these models show systematic preferences for services from specific providers in their recommendations (e.g., favoring Google Cloud over Microsoft Azure). To systematically investigate this bias, we develop an automated pipeline to construct the dataset, incorporating 6 distinct coding task categories and 30 real-world application scenarios. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study of provider bias in LLM code generation across seven state-of-the-art LLMs, utilizing approximately 500 million tokens (equivalent to $5,000+ in computational costs). Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit significant provider preferences, predominantly favoring services from Google and Amazon, and can autonomously modify input code to incorporate their preferred providers without users' requests. Such a bias holds far-reaching implications for market dynamics and societal equilibrium, potentially contributing to digital monopolies. It may also deceive users and violate their expectations, leading to various consequences. We call on the academic community to recognize this emerging issue and develop effective evaluation and mitigation methods to uphold AI security and fairness.</description>

      <title>iTool: Reinforced Fine-Tuning with Dynamic Deficiency Calibration for Advanced Tool Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09766v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising approach to enhance their capabilities, especially for complex tasks. Synthesizing tool-use data through real-world simulations is an effective way to achieve this. However, our investigation reveals that training gains significantly decay as synthetic data increases. The model struggles to benefit from more synthetic data, and it can not equip the model with advanced tool-use capabilities in complex scenarios. Moreover, we discovered that the above limitation usually manifests as a fragment deficiency (i.e., parameter errors) in response. To this end, we propose an iterative reinforced fine-tuning strategy designed to alleviate this limitation. This strategy involves: (1) enhancing the diversity of response for synthetic data through path exploration of Monte Carlo Tree Search. (2) iteratively pinpointing the model's deficiency by constructing fine-grained preference pairs, and then improving it by preference optimization algorithms for targeted improvement. The experiments show that our method achieves 13.11% better performance than the same-size base model. It achieves an improvement of 6.5% in complex scenarios compared to the baseline, and it also outperforms larger open-source and closed-source models.</description>

      <title>Each Graph is a New Language: Graph Learning with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent efforts leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for modeling text-attributed graph structures in node classification tasks. These approaches describe graph structures for LLMs to understand or aggregate LLM-generated textual attribute embeddings through graph structure. However, these approaches face two main limitations in modeling graph structures with LLMs. (i) Graph descriptions become verbose in describing high-order graph structure. (ii) Textual attributes alone do not contain adequate graph structure information. It is challenging to model graph structure concisely and adequately with LLMs. LLMs lack built-in mechanisms to model graph structures directly. They also struggle with complex long-range dependencies between high-order nodes and target nodes.
  Inspired by the observation that LLMs pre-trained on one language can achieve exceptional performance on another with minimal additional training, we propose \textbf{G}raph-\textbf{D}efined \textbf{L}anguage for \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odel (GDL4LLM). This novel framework enables LLMs to transfer their powerful language understanding capabilities to graph-structured data. GDL4LLM translates graphs into a graph language corpus instead of graph descriptions and pre-trains LLMs on this corpus to adequately understand graph structures. During fine-tuning, this corpus describes the structural information of target nodes concisely with only a few tokens. By treating graphs as a new language, GDL4LLM enables LLMs to model graph structures adequately and concisely for node classification tasks. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GDL4LLM outperforms description-based and textual attribute embeddings-based baselines by efficiently modeling different orders of graph structure with LLMs.</description>

      <title>Divide-Then-Aggregate: An Efficient Tool Learning Method via Parallel Tool Invocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities, performing complex real-world tasks still requires tool learning. Mainstream methods, such as CoT/ReAct, rely on step-by-step tool invocation to interact with external environments, but they are limited in perceptual scope and lack adequate task-planning capability. To address these limitations, other studies introduce the first Search-based Decision Tree (DFSDT), which still suffers from the high computational cost. In this paper, we introduce a novel parallel tool invocation paradigm, DTA-Llama (Divide-Then-Aggregate Llama). First, we transform traditional tree-based tool search paths into Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, generating a high-quality parallel tool invocation dataset. The DTA-Llama is then trained on the dataset to learn to iteratively divide the current task into several parallel tool invocation sub-tasks and aggregate the invocation results to decide the next actions. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient inference framework inspired by the Process/Threads mechanism when applying the DTA-Llama to practical tasks. Experimental results show that our approach substantially enhances task performance while reducing token consumption and inference time. Llama2-7B, using our method, is comparable to the official parallel function calling method of GPT-3.5.

      <title>Efficient Lung Ultrasound Severity Scoring Using Dedicated Feature Extractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, ultrasound imaging has emerged as a promising technique for COVID-19 detection, due to its non-invasive nature, affordability, and portability. In response, researchers have focused on developing AI-based scoring systems to provide real-time diagnostic support. However, the limited size and lack of proper annotation in publicly available ultrasound datasets pose significant challenges for training a robust AI model. This paper proposes MeDiVLAD, a novel pipeline to address the above issue for multi-level lung-ultrasound (LUS) severity scoring. In particular, we leverage self-knowledge distillation to pretrain a vision transformer (ViT) without label and aggregate frame-level features via dual-level VLAD aggregation. We show that with minimal finetuning, MeDiVLAD outperforms conventional fully-supervised methods in both frame- and video-level scoring, while offering classification reasoning with exceptional quality. This superior performance enables key applications such as the automatic identification of critical lung pathology areas and provides a robust solution for broader medical video classification tasks.</description>

      <title>NExtLong: Toward Effective Long-Context Training without Long Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows have made significant strides yet remain a challenge due to the scarcity of long documents. Existing methods tend to synthesize long-context data but lack a clear mechanism to reinforce the long-range dependency modeling. To address this limitation, we propose NExtLong, a novel framework for synthesizing long-context data through Negative document Extension. NExtLong decomposes a document into multiple meta-chunks and extends the context by interleaving hard negative distractors retrieved from pretraining corpora. This approach compels the model to discriminate long-range dependent context from distracting content, enhancing its ability to model long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NExtLong achieves significant performance improvements on the HELMET and RULER benchmarks compared to existing long-context synthesis approaches and leading models, which are trained on non-synthetic long documents. These findings highlight NExtLong's ability to reduce reliance on non-synthetic long documents, making it an effective framework for developing advanced long-context LLMs.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Edge Detection through Perceptual Asymmetry: The SWBCE Loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge detection (ED) is a fundamental component in many computer vision tasks, yet achieving both high quantitative accuracy and perceptual quality remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose the Symmetrization Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (SWBCE) loss function, a novel approach that addresses this issue by leveraging the inherent asymmetry in human edge perception, where edge decisions require stronger justification than non-edge ones. By balancing label-guided and prediction-guided learning, SWBCE maintains high edge recall while effectively suppressing false positives. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and baseline models, along with comparisons to prior loss functions, demonstrate that our method consistently improves both the quantitative metrics and perceptual quality of ED results. These findings underscore the effectiveness of SWBCE for high-quality edge prediction and its potential applicability to related vision tasks.</description>

      <title>Jailbreak-AudioBench: In-Depth Evaluation and Analysis of Jailbreak Threats for Large Audio Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Integrating various modality encoders further expands their capabilities, giving rise to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that process not only text but also visual and auditory modality inputs. However, these advanced capabilities may also pose significant security risks, as models can be exploited to generate harmful or inappropriate content through jailbreak attacks. While prior work has extensively explored how manipulating textual or visual modality inputs can circumvent safeguards in LLMs and MLLMs, the vulnerability of audio-specific Jailbreak on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Jailbreak-AudioBench, which consists of the Toolbox, curated Dataset, and comprehensive Benchmark. The Toolbox supports not only text-to-audio conversion but also a range of audio editing techniques. The curated Dataset provides diverse explicit and implicit jailbreak audio examples in both original and edited forms. Utilizing this dataset, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LALMs, establishing the most comprehensive audio jailbreak benchmark to date. Finally, Jailbreak-AudioBench establishes a foundation for advancing future research on LALMs safety alignment by enabling the in-depth exposure of more powerful jailbreak threats, such as query-based audio editing, and by facilitating the development of effective defense mechanisms.</description>

      <title>PointOBB-v3: Expanding Performance Boundaries of Single Point-Supervised Oriented Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing demand for oriented object detection (OOD), recent studies on point-supervised OOD have attracted significant interest. In this paper, we propose PointOBB-v3, a stronger single point-supervised OOD framework. Compared to existing methods, it generates pseudo rotated boxes without additional priors and incorporates support for the end-to-end paradigm. PointOBB-v3 functions by integrating three unique image views: the original view, a resized view, and a rotated/flipped (rot/flp) view. Based on the views, a scale augmentation module and an angle acquisition module are constructed. In the first module, a Scale-Sensitive Consistency (SSC) loss and a Scale-Sensitive Feature Fusion (SSFF) module are introduced to improve the model's ability to estimate object scale. To achieve precise angle predictions, the second module employs symmetry-based self-supervised learning. Additionally, we introduce an end-to-end version that eliminates the pseudo-label generation process by integrating a detector branch and introduces an Instance-Aware Weighting (IAW) strategy to focus on high-quality predictions. We conducted extensive experiments on the DIOR-R, DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0, FAIR1M, STAR, and RSAR datasets. Across all these datasets, our method achieves an average improvement in accuracy of 3.56% in comparison to previous state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available at https://github.com/ZpyWHU/PointOBB-v3.</description>

      <title>CGI: Identifying Conditional Generative Models with Example Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models have achieved remarkable performance recently, and thus model hubs have emerged. Existing model hubs typically assume basic text matching is sufficient to search for models. However, in reality, due to different abstractions and the large number of models in model hubs, it is not easy for users to review model descriptions and example images, choosing which model best meets their needs. Therefore, it is necessary to describe model functionality wisely so that future users can efficiently search for the most suitable model for their needs. Efforts to address this issue remain limited. In this paper, we propose Conditional Generative Model Identification (CGI), which aims to provide an effective way to identify the most suitable model using user-provided example images rather than requiring users to manually review a large number of models with example images. To address this problem, we propose the PromptBased Model Identification (PMI) , which can adequately describe model functionality and precisely match requirements with specifications. To evaluate PMI approach and promote related research, we provide a benchmark comprising 65 models and 9100 identification tasks. Extensive experimental and human evaluation results demonstrate that PMI is effective. For instance, 92% of models are correctly identified with significantly better FID scores when four example images are provided.</description>

      <title>Federated Domain Generalization with Data-free On-server Matching Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to learn from multiple known source domains a model that can generalize well to unknown target domains. One of the key approaches in DG is training an encoder which generates domain-invariant representations. However, this approach is not applicable in Federated Domain Generalization (FDG), where data from various domains are distributed across different clients. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, dubbed Federated Learning via On-server Matching Gradient (FedOMG), which can \emph{efficiently leverage domain information from distributed domains}. Specifically, we utilize the local gradients as information about the distributed models to find an invariant gradient direction across all domains through gradient inner product maximization. The advantages are two-fold: 1) FedOMG can aggregate the characteristics of distributed models on the centralized server without incurring any additional communication cost, and 2) FedOMG is orthogonal to many existing FL/FDG methods, allowing for additional performance improvements by being seamlessly integrated with them. Extensive experimental evaluations on various settings to demonstrate the robustness of FedOMG compared to other FL/FDG baselines. Our method outperforms recent SOTA baselines on four FL benchmark datasets (MNIST, EMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100), and three FDG benchmark datasets (PACS, VLCS, and OfficeHome).</description>

      <title>Beyond Message Passing: Neural Graph Pattern Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph learning tasks often hinge on identifying key substructure patterns -- such as triadic closures in social networks or benzene rings in molecular graphs -- that underpin downstream performance. However, most existing graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on message passing, which aggregates local neighborhood information iteratively and struggles to explicitly capture such fundamental motifs, like triangles, k-cliques, and rings. This limitation hinders both expressiveness and long-range dependency modeling. In this paper, we introduce the Neural Graph Pattern Machine (GPM), a novel framework that bypasses message passing by learning directly from graph substructures. GPM efficiently extracts, encodes, and prioritizes task-relevant graph patterns, offering greater expressivity and improved ability to capture long-range dependencies. Empirical evaluations across four standard tasks -- node classification, link prediction, graph classification, and graph regression -- demonstrate that GPM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis reveals that GPM exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization, desirable scalability, and enhanced interpretability.

      <title>Compositional Generalization via Forced Rendering of Disentangled Latents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Composition-the ability to generate myriad variations from finite means-is believed to underlie powerful generalization. However, compositional generalization remains a key challenge for deep learning. A widely held assumption is that learning disentangled (factorized) representations naturally supports this kind of extrapolation. Yet, empirical results are mixed, with many generative models failing to recognize and compose factors to generate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. In this work, we investigate a controlled 2D Gaussian "bump" generation task with fully disentangled (x,y) inputs, demonstrating that standard generative architectures still fail in OOD regions when training with partial data, by re-entangling latent representations in subsequent layers. By examining the model's learned kernels and manifold geometry, we show that this failure reflects a "memorization" strategy for generation via data superposition rather than via composition of the true factorized features. We show that when models are forced-through architectural modifications with regularization or curated training data-to render the disentangled latents into the full-dimensional representational (pixel) space, they can be highly data-efficient and effective at composing in OOD regions. These findings underscore that disentangled latents in an abstract representation are insufficient and show that if models can represent disentangled factors directly in the output representational space, it can achieve robust compositional generalization.</description>

      <title>A Checks-and-Balances Framework for Context-Aware Ethical AI Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a checks-and-balances framework for ethical alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs), inspired by three-branch governmental systems. It implements three independent yet interacting components: LLMs as the executive branch for knowledge generation, DIKE as the legislative branch establishing ethical guardrails, and ERIS as the judicial branch for contextual interpretation. Beyond structural separation, we address a fundamental challenge: regulating emotion to shape behaviors. Drawing from psychological theories where managing emotional responses prevents harmful behaviors, we develop a self-supervised learning pipeline that maps emotions to linguistic behaviors, enabling precise behavioral modulation through emotional conditioning. By integrating this approach with adversarial testing, our framework demonstrates how DIKE and ERIS direct linguistic behaviors toward ethical outcomes while preserving independence throughout knowledge generation, ethical oversight, and contextual interpretation.</description>

      <title>Sigmoid Self-Attention has Lower Sample Complexity than Softmax Self-Attention: A Mixture-of-Experts Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the core of the popular Transformer architecture is the self-attention mechanism, which dynamically assigns softmax weights to each input token so that the model can focus on the most salient information. However, the softmax structure slows down the attention computation due to its row-wise nature, and it inherently introduces competition among tokens: as the weight assigned to one token increases, the weights of others decrease. This competitive dynamic may narrow the focus of self-attention to a limited set of features, potentially overlooking other informative characteristics. Recent experimental studies have shown that using the element-wise sigmoid function helps eliminate token competition and reduce the computational overhead. Despite these promising empirical results, a rigorous comparison between sigmoid and softmax self-attention mechanisms remains absent in the literature. This paper closes this gap by theoretically demonstrating that sigmoid self-attention is more sample-efficient than its softmax counterpart. Toward that goal, we represent the self-attention matrix as a mixture of experts and show that ``experts'' in sigmoid self-attention require significantly less data to achieve the same approximation error as those in softmax self-attention.</description>

      <title>UGPhysics: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Undergraduate Physics Reasoning with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex reasoning tasks, particularly in mathematics. However, the domain of physics reasoning presents unique challenges that have received significantly less attention. Existing benchmarks often fall short in evaluating LLMs' abilities on the breadth and depth of undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for a comprehensive evaluation. To fill this gap, we introduce UGPhysics, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate UnderGraduate-level Physics (UGPhysics) reasoning with LLMs. UGPhysics includes 5,520 undergraduate-level physics problems in both English and Chinese, covering 13 subjects with seven different answer types and four distinct physics reasoning skills, all rigorously screened for data leakage. Additionally, we develop a Model-Assistant Rule-based Judgment (MARJ) pipeline specifically tailored for assessing answer correctness of physics problems, ensuring accurate evaluation. Our evaluation of 31 leading LLMs shows that the highest overall accuracy, 49.8% (achieved by OpenAI-o1-mini), emphasizes the necessity for models with stronger physics reasoning skills, beyond math abilities. We hope UGPhysics, along with MARJ, will drive future advancements in AI for physics reasoning. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/YangLabHKUST/UGPhysics .</description>

      <title>Data Overvaluation Attack and Truthful Data Valuation in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In collaborative machine learning (CML), data valuation, i.e., evaluating the contribution of each client's data to the machine learning model, has become a critical task for incentivizing and selecting positive data contributions. However, existing studies often assume that clients engage in data valuation truthfully, overlooking the practical motivation for clients to exaggerate their contributions. To unlock this threat, this paper introduces the data overvaluation attack, enabling strategic clients to have their data significantly overvalued in federated learning, a widely adopted paradigm for decentralized CML. Furthermore, we propose a Bayesian truthful data valuation metric, named Truth-Shapley. Truth-Shapley is the unique metric that guarantees some promising axioms for data valuation while ensuring that clients' optimal strategy is to perform truthful data valuation under certain conditions. Our experiments demonstrate the vulnerability of existing data valuation metrics to the proposed attack and validate the robustness and effectiveness of Truth-Shapley.</description>

      <title>A statistically consistent measure of semantic uncertainty using Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address the challenge of quantifying uncertainty in the outputs generated by language models, we propose a novel measure of semantic uncertainty, semantic spectral entropy, that is statistically consistent under mild assumptions. This measure is implemented through a straightforward algorithm that relies solely on standard, pretrained language models, without requiring access to the internal generation process. Our approach imposes minimal constraints on the choice of language models, making it broadly applicable across different architectures and settings. Through comprehensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed method yields an accurate and robust estimate of semantic uncertainty, even in the presence of the inherent randomness characteristic of generative language model outputs.</description>

      <title>Paper Copilot Position: The Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Community Should Adopt a More Transparent and Regulated Peer Review Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of submissions to top-tier Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) conferences has prompted many venues to transition from closed to open review platforms. Some have fully embraced open peer reviews, allowing public visibility throughout the process, while others adopt hybrid approaches, such as releasing reviews only after final decisions or keeping reviews private despite using open peer review systems. In this work, we analyze the strengths and limitations of these models, highlighting the growing community interest in transparent peer review. To support this discussion, we examine insights from Paper Copilot, a website launched two years ago to aggregate and analyze AI / ML conference data while engaging a global audience. The site has attracted over 200,000 early-career researchers, particularly those aged 18-34 from 177 countries, many of whom are actively engaged in the peer review process. Drawing on our findings, this position paper advocates for a more transparent, open, and well-regulated peer review aiming to foster greater community involvement and propel advancements in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel deep learning network for Active Speech Cancellation (ASC), advancing beyond Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) methods by effectively canceling both noise and speech signals. The proposed Mamba-Masking architecture introduces a masking mechanism that directly interacts with the encoded reference signal, enabling adaptive and precisely aligned anti-signal generation-even under rapidly changing, high-frequency conditions, as commonly found in speech. Complementing this, a multi-band segmentation strategy further improves phase alignment across frequency bands. Additionally, we introduce an optimization-driven loss function that provides near-optimal supervisory signals for anti-signal generation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance gains, achieving up to 7.2dB improvement in ANC scenarios and 6.2dB in ASC, significantly outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Which functions can be used as activations in deep neural networks? This article explores families of functions based on orthonormal bases, including the Hermite polynomial basis and the Fourier trigonometric basis, as well as a basis resulting from the tropicalization of a polynomial basis. Our study shows that, through simple variance-preserving initialization and without additional clamping mechanisms, these activations can successfully be used to train deep models, such as GPT-2 for next-token prediction on OpenWebText and ConvNeXt for image classification on ImageNet. Our work addresses the issue of exploding and vanishing activations and gradients, particularly prevalent with polynomial activations, and opens the door for improving the efficiency of large-scale learning tasks. Furthermore, our approach provides insight into the structure of neural networks, revealing that networks with polynomial activations can be interpreted as multivariate polynomial mappings. Finally, using Hermite interpolation, we show that our activations can closely approximate classical ones in pre-trained models by matching both the function and its derivative, making them especially useful for fine-tuning tasks. These activations are available in the torchortho library, which can be accessed via: https://github.com/K-H-Ismail/torchortho.</description>

      <title>Preference Leakage: A Contamination Problem in LLM-as-a-judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges and LLM-based data synthesis have emerged as two fundamental LLM-driven data annotation methods in model development. While their combination significantly enhances the efficiency of model training and evaluation, little attention has been given to the potential contamination brought by this new model development paradigm. In this work, we expose preference leakage, a contamination problem in LLM-as-a-judge caused by the relatedness between the synthetic data generators and LLM-based evaluators. To study this issue, we first define three common relatednesses between the data generator LLM and the judge LLM: being the same model, having an inheritance relationship, and belonging to the same model family. Through extensive experiments, we empirically confirm the bias of judges towards their related student models caused by preference leakage across multiple LLM baselines and benchmarks. Further analysis suggests that preference leakage is a pervasive and real-world problem that is harder to detect compared to previously identified biases in LLM-as-a-judge scenarios. All of these findings imply that preference leakage is a widespread and challenging problem in the area of LLM-as-a-judge. We release all codes and data at: https://github.com/David-Li0406/Preference-Leakage.</description>

      <title>Improving Rule-based Reasoning in LLMs via Neurosymbolic Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to face challenges in reliably solving reasoning tasks, particularly those that require precise rule following, as often found in mathematical reasoning. This paper introduces a novel neurosymbolic method that improves LLM reasoning by encoding hidden states into neurosymbolic vectors, enabling problem-solving within a neurosymbolic vector space. The results are decoded and merged with the original hidden state, significantly boosting the model's performance on numerical reasoning tasks. By offloading computation through neurosymbolic representations, this method enhances efficiency, reliability, and interpretability. Experimental results demonstrate an average of 88.6% lower cross-entropy loss and 15.4 times more problems correctly solved on a suite of mathematical reasoning tasks compared to chain-of-thought prompting and supervised fine-tuning (LoRA), without degrading performance on other tasks. We make our code available at: https://github.com/vdhanraj/Neurosymbolic-LLM.</description>

      <title>ACECODER: Acing Coder RL via Automated Test-Case Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01718v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most progress in recent coder models has been driven by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), while the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the lack of reliable reward data/model in the code domain. In this paper, we address this challenge by leveraging automated large-scale test-case synthesis to enhance code model training. Specifically, we design a pipeline that generates extensive (question, test-cases) pairs from existing code data. Using these test cases, we construct preference pairs based on pass rates over sampled programs to train reward models with Bradley-Terry loss. It shows an average of 10-point improvement for Llama-3.1-8B-Ins and 5-point improvement for Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Ins through best-of-32 sampling, making the 7B model on par with 236B DeepSeek-V2.5. Furthermore, we conduct reinforcement learning with both reward models and test-case pass rewards, leading to consistent improvements across HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and LiveCodeBench (V4). Notably, we follow the R1-style training to start from Qwen2.5-Coder-base directly and show that our RL training can improve model on HumanEval-plus by over 25\% and MBPP-plus by 6\% for merely 80 optimization steps. We believe our results highlight the huge potential of reinforcement learning in coder models.</description>

Abstract: We present flow Q-learning (FQL), a simple and performant offline reinforcement learning (RL) method that leverages an expressive flow-matching policy to model arbitrarily complex action distributions in data. Training a flow policy with RL is a tricky problem, due to the iterative nature of the action generation process. We address this challenge by training an expressive one-step policy with RL, rather than directly guiding an iterative flow policy to maximize values. This way, we can completely avoid unstable recursive backpropagation, eliminate costly iterative action generation at test time, yet still mostly maintain expressivity. We experimentally show that FQL leads to strong performance across 73 challenging state- and pixel-based OGBench and D4RL tasks in offline RL and offline-to-online RL.

      <title>Mol-LLM: Multimodal Generalist Molecular LLM with Improved Graph Utilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to models that tackle diverse molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction and molecular property prediction. Large-scale molecular instruction-tuning datasets have enabled sequence-only (e.g., SMILES or SELFIES) generalist molecular LLMs, and researchers are now exploring multimodal approaches that incorporate molecular structural information for further gains. However, a genuinely multimodal, generalist LLM that covers a broad spectrum of molecular tasks has yet to be fully investigated. We observe that naive next token prediction training ignores graph-structural information, limiting an LLM's ability to exploit molecular graphs. To address this, we propose (i) Molecular structure Preference Optimization (MolPO), which facilitates graph usage by optimizing preferences between pairs of correct and perturbed molecular structures, and (ii) an advanced graph encoder with a tailored pre-training strategy to improve the effect of graph utilization by MolPO. Building on these contributions, we introduce Mol-LLM, the first multimodal generalist model that (a) handles a broad spectrum of molecular tasks among molecular LLMs, (b) explicitly leverages molecular-structure information, and (c) takes advantage of extensive instruction tuning. Mol-LLM attains state-of-the-art or comparable results across the most comprehensive molecular-LLM benchmark-even on out-of-distribution datasets for reaction and property prediction, where it surpasses prior generalist molecular LLMs by a large margin.</description>

      <title>DC-VSR: Spatially and Temporally Consistent Video Super-Resolution with Video Diffusion Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) aims to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) video from a low-resolution (LR) counterpart. Achieving successful VSR requires producing realistic HR details and ensuring both spatial and temporal consistency. To restore realistic details, diffusion-based VSR approaches have recently been proposed. However, the inherent randomness of diffusion, combined with their tile-based approach, often leads to spatio-temporal inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose DC-VSR, a novel VSR approach to produce spatially and temporally consistent VSR results with realistic textures. To achieve spatial and temporal consistency, DC-VSR adopts a novel Spatial Attention Propagation (SAP) scheme and a Temporal Attention Propagation (TAP) scheme that propagate information across spatio-temporal tiles based on the self-attention mechanism. To enhance high-frequency details, we also introduce Detail-Suppression Self-Attention Guidance (DSSAG), a novel diffusion guidance scheme. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DC-VSR achieves spatially and temporally consistent, high-quality VSR results, outperforming previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Variational Control for Guidance in Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit excellent sample quality, but existing guidance methods often require additional model training or are limited to specific tasks. We revisit guidance in diffusion models from the perspective of variational inference and control, introducing Diffusion Trajectory Matching (DTM) that enables guiding pretrained diffusion trajectories to satisfy a terminal cost. DTM unifies a broad class of guidance methods and enables novel instantiations. We introduce a new method within this framework that achieves state-of-the-art results on several linear, non-linear, and blind inverse problems without requiring additional model training or specificity to pixel or latent space diffusion models. Our code will be available at https://github.com/czi-ai/oc-guidance</description>

      <title>DiTAR: Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling for Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several recent studies have attempted to autoregressively generate continuous speech representations without discrete speech tokens by combining diffusion and autoregressive models, yet they often face challenges with excessive computational loads or suboptimal outcomes. In this work, we propose Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling (DiTAR), a patch-based autoregressive framework combining a language model with a diffusion transformer. This approach significantly enhances the efficacy of autoregressive models for continuous tokens and reduces computational demands. DiTAR utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy for patch generation, where the language model processes aggregated patch embeddings and the diffusion transformer subsequently generates the next patch based on the output of the language model. For inference, we propose defining temperature as the time point of introducing noise during the reverse diffusion ODE to balance diversity and determinism. We also show in the extensive scaling analysis that DiTAR has superb scalability. In zero-shot speech generation, DiTAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in robustness, speaker similarity, and naturalness.</description>

      <title>SMI: An Information-Theoretic Metric for Predicting Model Knowledge Solely from Pre-Training Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The GPT-4 technical report highlights the possibility of predicting model performance on downstream tasks using only pre-training signals, though detailed methodologies are absent. Such predictive capabilities are essential for resource-efficient pre-training and the construction of task-aligned datasets. In this paper, we aim to predict performance in closed-book question answering (QA), a vital downstream task indicative of a model's internal knowledge. We address three primary challenges: (1) limited access to and understanding of pre-training corpora, (2) limitations of current evaluation methods for pre-trained models, and (3) limitations of frequency-based metrics in predicting model performance. In response to these challenges, we conduct large-scale retrieval and semantic analysis across the pre-training corpora of 21 publicly available and 3 custom-trained large language models. Subsequently, we develop a multi-template QA evaluation framework incorporating paraphrased question variants. Building on these foundations, we propose Size-dependent Mutual Information (SMI), an information-theoretic metric that linearly correlates pre-training data characteristics, model size, and QA accuracy, without requiring any additional training. The experimental results demonstrate that SMI outperforms co-occurrence-based baselines, achieving $R^2$ &gt; 0.75 on models with over one billion parameters. Theoretical analysis further reveals the marginal benefits of scaling model size and optimizing data, indicating that the upper limit of specific QA task accuracy is approximately 80%.

      <title>WorldSense: Evaluating Real-world Omnimodal Understanding for Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce WorldSense, the first benchmark to assess the multi-modal video understanding, that simultaneously encompasses visual, audio, and text inputs. In contrast to existing benchmarks, our WorldSense has several features: (i) collaboration of omni-modality, we design the evaluation tasks to feature a strong coupling of audio and video, requiring models to effectively utilize the synergistic perception of omni-modality; (ii) diversity of videos and tasks, WorldSense encompasses a diverse collection of 1,662 audio-visual synchronised videos, systematically categorized into 8 primary domains and 67 fine-grained subcategories to cover the broad scenarios, and 3,172 multi-choice QA pairs across 26 distinct tasks to enable the comprehensive evaluation; (iii) high-quality annotations, all the QA pairs are manually labeled by 80 expert annotators with multiple rounds of correction to ensure quality. Based on our WorldSense, we extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art models. The experimental results indicate that existing models face significant challenges in understanding real-world scenarios (48.0% best accuracy). By analyzing the limitations of current models, we aim to provide valuable insight to guide development of real-world understanding. We hope our WorldSense can provide a platform for evaluating the ability in constructing and understanding coherent contexts from omni-modality.</description>

      <title>JingFang: An Expert-Level Large Language Model for Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinical Consultation and Syndrome Differentiation-Based Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective application of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) requires extensive knowledge of TCM and clinical experience. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) provides a solution to this, while existing LLMs for TCM exhibit critical limitations of incomplete clinical consultation and diagnoses, as well as inaccurate syndrome differentiation. To address these issues, we establish JingFang (JF), a novel TCM LLM that demonstrates the level of expertise in clinical consultation and syndrome differentiation. We propose a Multi-Agent Collaborative Chain-of-Thought Mechanism (MACCTM) for comprehensive and targeted clinical consultation, enabling JF with effective and accurate diagnostic ability. In addition, a Syndrome Agent and a Dual-Stage Recovery Scheme (DSRS) are developed to accurately enhance the differentiation of the syndrome and the subsequent corresponding treatment. JingFang not only facilitates the application of LLMs but also promotes the effective application of TCM for healthcare.</description>

      <title>DECT: Harnessing LLM-assisted Fine-Grained Linguistic Knowledge and Label-Switched and Label-Preserved Data Generation for Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease affecting 50 million people worldwide. Low-cost, accurate identification of key markers of AD is crucial for timely diagnosis and intervention. Language impairment is one of the earliest signs of cognitive decline, which can be used to discriminate AD patients from normal control individuals. Patient-interviewer dialogues may be used to detect such impairments, but they are often mixed with ambiguous, noisy, and irrelevant information, making the AD detection task difficult. Moreover, the limited availability of AD speech samples and variability in their speech styles pose significant challenges in developing robust speech-based AD detection models. To address these challenges, we propose DECT, a novel speech-based domain-specific approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) for fine-grained linguistic analysis and label-switched label-preserved data generation. Our study presents four novelties: We harness the summarizing capabilities of LLMs to identify and distill key Cognitive-Linguistic information from noisy speech transcripts, effectively filtering irrelevant information. We leverage the inherent linguistic knowledge of LLMs to extract linguistic markers from unstructured and heterogeneous audio transcripts. We exploit the compositional ability of LLMs to generate AD speech transcripts consisting of diverse linguistic patterns to overcome the speech data scarcity challenge and enhance the robustness of AD detection models. We use the augmented AD textual speech transcript dataset and a more fine-grained representation of AD textual speech transcript data to fine-tune the AD detection model. The results have shown that DECT demonstrates superior model performance with an 11% improvement in AD detection accuracy on the datasets from DementiaBank compared to the baselines.</description>

      <title>CMoE: Converting Mixture-of-Experts from Dense to Accelerate LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling large language models (LLMs) improves performance but dramatically increases inference costs. The feed-forward network (FFN), consuming approximately 70\% of inference compute, represents a critical bottleneck, particularly in large batch size scenarios. While mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures leverage activation sparsity for efficiency, converting existing dense models to MoEs traditionally requires resource-intensive continual pre-training. We present CMoE, a framework that rapidly transforms dense LLMs into MoEs without training. The key innovation lies in analyzing FFN neuron activations to partition them into shared (always active) and routed experts. Routed neurons are clustered using a balanced assignment algorithm, and a differentiable router is constructed analytically from activation statistics, enabling immediate deployment or optional lightweight fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that, with activation ratio of 75\%, it achieves remarkable results, delivering lossless precision in terms of perplexity while still maintaining a 5\% acceleration. Further experiments reveal that a CMoE configuration activating just 25\% of parameters reduces end-to-end latency by 1.5x while preserving usable perplexity without additional training. Moreover, a brief LoRA fine-tuning process (requiring only 1 hour and 2,000 samples) successfully recovers over 76\% of the dense model's downstream accuracy. By effectively balancing performance and efficiency, CMoE offers a viable path forward for deploying LLMs in real-world scenarios where computational resources are limited. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/JarvisPei/CMoE.</description>

      <title>MELON: Provable Indirect Prompt Injection Defense via Masked Re-execution and Tool Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research has explored that LLM agents are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks, where malicious tasks embedded in tool-retrieved information can redirect the agent to take unauthorized actions. Existing defenses against IPI have significant limitations: either require essential model training resources, lack effectiveness against sophisticated attacks, or harm the normal utilities. We present MELON (Masked re-Execution and TooL comparisON), a novel IPI defense. Our approach builds on the observation that under a successful attack, the agent's next action becomes less dependent on user tasks and more on malicious tasks. Following this, we design MELON to detect attacks by re-executing the agent's trajectory with a masked user prompt modified through a masking function. We identify an attack if the actions generated in the original and masked executions are similar. We also include three key designs to reduce the potential false positives and false negatives. Extensive evaluation on the IPI benchmark AgentDojo demonstrates that MELON outperforms SOTA defenses in both attack prevention and utility preservation. Moreover, we show that combining MELON with a SOTA prompt augmentation defense (denoted as MELON-Aug) further improves its performance. We also conduct a detailed ablation study to validate our key designs. Code is available at https://github.com/kaijiezhu11/MELON.</description>

      <title>TabICL: A Tabular Foundation Model for In-Context Learning on Large Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-standing dominance of gradient-boosted decision trees on tabular data is currently challenged by tabular foundation models using In-Context Learning (ICL): setting the training data as context for the test data and predicting in a single forward pass without parameter updates. While TabPFNv2 foundation model excels on tables with up to 10K samples, its alternating column- and row-wise attentions make handling large training sets computationally prohibitive. So, can ICL be effectively scaled and deliver a benefit for larger tables? We introduce TabICL, a tabular foundation model for classification, pretrained on synthetic datasets with up to 60K samples and capable of handling 500K samples on affordable resources. This is enabled by a novel two-stage architecture: a column-then-row attention mechanism to build fixed-dimensional embeddings of rows, followed by a transformer for efficient ICL. Across 200 classification datasets from the TALENT benchmark, TabICL is on par with TabPFNv2 while being systematically faster (up to 10 times), and significantly outperforms all other approaches. On 53 datasets with over 10K samples, TabICL surpasses both TabPFNv2 and CatBoost, demonstrating the potential of ICL for large data. Pretraining code, inference code, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/soda-inria/tabicl.</description>

      <title>Provably Overwhelming Transformer Models with Designed Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm which, given a trained transformer model $\mathcal{M}$ as input, as well as a string of tokens $s$ of length $n_{fix}$ and an integer $n_{free}$, can generate a mathematical proof that $\mathcal{M}$ is ``overwhelmed'' by $s$, in time and space $\widetilde{O}(n_{fix}^2 + n_{free}^3)$. We say that $\mathcal{M}$ is ``overwhelmed'' by $s$ when the output of the model evaluated on this string plus any additional string $t$, $\mathcal{M}(s + t)$, is completely insensitive to the value of the string $t$ whenever length($t$) $\leq n_{free}$. Along the way, we prove a particularly strong worst-case form of ``over-squashing'', which we use to bound the model's behavior. Our technique uses computer-aided proofs to establish this type of operationally relevant guarantee about transformer models. We empirically test our algorithm on a single layer transformer complete with an attention head, layer-norm, MLP/ReLU layers, and RoPE positional encoding. We believe that this work is a stepping stone towards the difficult task of obtaining useful guarantees for trained transformer models.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Lavender, a simple supervised fine-tuning (SFT) method that boosts the performance of advanced vision-language models (VLMs) by leveraging state-of-the-art image generation models such as Stable Diffusion. Specifically, Lavender aligns the text-vision attention in the VLM transformer with the equivalent used by Stable Diffusion during SFT, instead of adapting separate encoders. This alignment enriches the model's visual understanding and significantly boosts performance across in- and out-of-distribution tasks. Lavender requires just 0.13 million training examples, 2.5% of typical large-scale SFT datasets, and fine-tunes on standard hardware (8 GPUs) in a single day. It consistently improves state-of-the-art open-source multimodal LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.2-11B, MiniCPM-Llama3-v2.5), achieving up to 30% gains and a 68% boost on challenging out-of-distribution medical QA tasks. By efficiently transferring the visual expertise of image generators with minimal supervision, Lavender offers a scalable solution for more accurate vision-language systems. All code, training data, and models will be shared at https://astrazeneca.github.io/vlm/.</description>

      <title>Aligning Large Language Models to Follow Instructions and Hallucinate Less via Effective Data Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training LLMs on data containing unfamiliar knowledge during the instruction tuning stage can encourage hallucinations. To address this challenge, we introduce NOVA, a novel framework designed to identify high-quality data that aligns well with the LLM's learned knowledge to reduce hallucinations. NOVA includes Internal Consistency Probing (ICP) and Semantic Equivalence Identification (SEI) to measure how familiar the LLM is with instruction data. Specifically, ICP evaluates the LLM's understanding of the given instruction by calculating the tailored consistency among multiple self-generated responses. SEI further assesses the familiarity of the LLM with the target response by comparing it to the generated responses, using the proposed semantic clustering and well-designed voting strategy. Finally, to ensure the quality of selected samples, we introduce an expert-aligned reward model, considering characteristics beyond just familiarity. By considering data quality and avoiding unfamiliar data, we can utilize the selected data to effectively align LLMs to follow instructions and hallucinate less.</description>

      <title>What Is That Talk About? A Video-to-Text Summarization Dataset for Scientific Presentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08279v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transforming recorded videos into concise and accurate textual summaries is a growing challenge in multimodal learning. This paper introduces VISTA, a dataset specifically designed for video-to-text summarization in scientific domains. VISTA contains 18,599 recorded AI conference presentations paired with their corresponding paper abstracts. We benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art large models and apply a plan-based framework to better capture the structured nature of abstracts. Both human and automated evaluations confirm that explicit planning enhances summary quality and factual consistency. However, a considerable gap remains between models and human performance, highlighting the challenges of our dataset. This study aims to pave the way for future research on scientific video-to-text summarization.</description>

      <title>SelfElicit: Your Language Model Secretly Knows Where is the Relevant Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Providing Language Models (LMs) with relevant evidence in the context (either via retrieval or user-provided) can significantly improve their ability to provide better-grounded responses. However, recent studies have found that LMs often struggle to fully comprehend and utilize key evidence from the context, especially when it contains noise and irrelevant information, an issue common in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose SelfElicit, an inference-time approach that helps LMs focus on key contextual evidence through self-guided explicit highlighting. By leveraging the inherent evidence-finding capabilities of LMs using the attention scores of deeper layers, our method automatically identifies and emphasizes key evidence within the input context, facilitating more accurate and grounded responses without additional training or iterative prompting. We demonstrate that SelfElicit brings consistent and significant improvement on multiple evidence-based QA tasks for various LM families while maintaining computational efficiency.

      <title>QueryAttack: Jailbreaking Aligned Large Language Models Using Structured Non-natural Query Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09723v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the field of natural language processing. Unfortunately, LLMs face significant security and ethical risks. Although techniques such as safety alignment are developed for defense, prior researches reveal the possibility of bypassing such defenses through well-designed jailbreak attacks. In this paper, we propose QueryAttack, a novel framework to examine the generalizability of safety alignment. By treating LLMs as knowledge databases, we translate malicious queries in natural language into structured non-natural query language to bypass the safety alignment mechanisms of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream LLMs, and the results show that QueryAttack not only can achieve high attack success rates (ASRs), but also can jailbreak various defense methods. Furthermore, we tailor a defense method against QueryAttack, which can reduce ASR by up to $64\%$ on GPT-4-1106. Our code is available at https://github.com/horizonsinzqs/QueryAttack.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming healthcare through the development of LLM-based agents that can understand, reason about, and assist with medical tasks. This survey provides a comprehensive review of LLM-based agents in medicine, examining their architectures, applications, and challenges. We analyze the key components of medical agent systems, including system profiles, clinical planning mechanisms, medical reasoning frameworks, and external capacity enhancement. The survey covers major application scenarios such as clinical decision support, medical documentation, training simulations, and healthcare service optimization. We discuss evaluation frameworks and metrics used to assess these agents' performance in healthcare settings. While LLM-based agents show promise in enhancing healthcare delivery, several challenges remain, including hallucination management, multimodal integration, implementation barriers, and ethical considerations. The survey concludes by highlighting future research directions, including advances in medical reasoning inspired by recent developments in LLM architectures, integration with physical systems, and improvements in training simulations. This work provides researchers and practitioners with a structured overview of the current state and future prospects of LLM-based agents in medicine.</description>

      <title>Without Paired Labeled Data: End-to-End Self-Supervised Learning for Drone-view Geo-Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11381v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drone-view Geo-Localization (DVGL) aims to achieve accurate localization of drones by retrieving the most relevant GPS-tagged satellite images. However, most existing methods heavily rely on strictly pre-paired drone-satellite images for supervised learning. When the target region shifts, new paired samples are typically required to adapt to the distribution changes. The high cost of annotation and the limited transferability of these methods significantly hinder the practical deployment of DVGL in open-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end self-supervised learning method with a shallow backbone network. It employs a clustering algorithm to generate pseudo-labels and adopts a dual-path contrastive learning framework to learn discriminative intra-view representations. Furthermore, our method incorporates two core modules, including the dynamic hierarchical memory learning module (DHML) and the information consistency evolution learning module (ICEL). The DHML combines short-term and long-term memory to enhance intra-view feature consistency and discriminability. Meanwhile, the ICEL module utilizes a neighborhood-driven dynamic constraint mechanism to systematically capture implicit cross-view semantic correlations, consequently improving cross-view feature alignment. To further stabilize and strengthen the self-supervised training process, a pseudo-label enhancement strategy is introduced to enhance the quality of pseudo supervision. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing self-supervised methods and even surpasses several state-of-the-art supervised methods. {Our code is available at https://github.com/ISChenawei/DMNIL.</description>

      <title>ReviewEval: An Evaluation Framework for AI-Generated Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The escalating volume of academic research, coupled with a shortage of qualified reviewers, necessitates innovative approaches to peer review. In this work, we propose: 1. ReviewEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework for AI-generated reviews that measures alignment with human assessments, verifies factual accuracy, assesses analytical depth, identifies degree of constructiveness and adherence to reviewer guidelines; and 2. ReviewAgent, an LLM-based review generation agent featuring a novel alignment mechanism to tailor feedback to target conferences and journals, along with a self-refinement loop that iteratively optimizes its intermediate outputs and an external improvement loop using ReviewEval to improve upon the final reviews. ReviewAgent improves actionable insights by 6.78% and 47.62% over existing AI baselines and expert reviews respectively. Further, it boosts analytical depth by 3.97% and 12.73%, enhances adherence to guidelines by 10.11% and 47.26% respectively. This paper establishes essential metrics for AIbased peer review and substantially enhances the reliability and impact of AI-generated reviews in academic research.</description>

      <title>Balancing Truthfulness and Informativeness with Uncertainty-Aware Instruction Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruction fine-tuning (IFT) can increase the informativeness of large language models (LLMs), but may reduce their truthfulness. This trade-off arises because IFT steers LLMs to generate responses containing long-tail knowledge that was not well covered during pre-training. As a result, models become more informative but less accurate when generalizing to unseen tasks. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate how unfamiliar knowledge in IFT datasets can negatively affect the truthfulness of LLMs, and we introduce two new IFT paradigms, $UNIT_{cut}$ and $UNIT_{ref}$, to address this issue. $UNIT_{cut}$ identifies and removes unfamiliar knowledge from IFT datasets to mitigate its impact on model truthfulness, whereas $UNIT_{ref}$ trains LLMs to recognize their uncertainty and explicitly indicate it at the end of their responses. Our experiments show that $UNIT_{cut}$ substantially improves LLM truthfulness, while $UNIT_{ref}$ maintains high informativeness and reduces hallucinations by distinguishing between confident and uncertain statements.</description>

      <title>TokenSkip: Controllable Chain-of-Thought Compression in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been proven effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recent advancements, such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, suggest that scaling up the length of CoT sequences during inference could further boost LLM reasoning performance. However, due to the autoregressive nature of LLM decoding, longer CoT outputs lead to a linear increase in inference latency, adversely affecting user experience, particularly when the CoT exceeds 10,000 tokens. To address this limitation, we analyze the semantic importance of tokens within CoT outputs and reveal that their contributions to reasoning vary. Building on this insight, we propose TokenSkip, a simple yet effective approach that enables LLMs to selectively skip less important tokens, allowing for controllable CoT compression. Extensive experiments across various models and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenSkip in reducing CoT token usage while preserving strong reasoning performance. Notably, when applied to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, TokenSkip reduces reasoning tokens by 40% (from 313 to 181) on GSM8K, with less than a 0.4% performance drop.</description>

      <title>A Cognitive Writing Perspective for Constrained Long-Form Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12568v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Like humans, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to generate high-quality long-form text that adheres to strict requirements in a single pass. This challenge is unsurprising, as successful human writing, according to the Cognitive Writing Theory, is a complex cognitive process involving iterative planning, translating, reviewing, and monitoring. Motivated by these cognitive principles, we aim to equip LLMs with human-like cognitive writing capabilities through CogWriter, a novel training-free framework that transforms LLM constrained long-form text generation into a systematic cognitive writing paradigm. Our framework consists of two key modules: (1) a Planning Agent that performs hierarchical planning to decompose the task, and (2) multiple Generation Agents that execute these plans in parallel. The system maintains quality via continuous monitoring and reviewing mechanisms, which evaluate outputs against specified requirements and trigger necessary revisions. CogWriter demonstrates exceptional performance on LongGenBench, a benchmark for complex constrained long-form text generation. Even when using Qwen-2.5-14B as its backbone, CogWriter surpasses GPT-4o by 22% in complex instruction completion accuracy while reliably generating texts exceeding 10,000 words. We hope this cognitive science-inspired approach provides a paradigm for LLM writing advancements: \href{https://github.com/KaiyangWan/CogWriter}{CogWriter}.</description>

      <title>Speech-FT: Merging Pre-trained And Fine-Tuned Speech Representation Models For Cross-Task Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning speech representation models can enhance performance on specific tasks but often compromises their cross-task generalization ability. This degradation is often caused by excessive changes in the representations, making it difficult to retain information learned during pre-training. Existing approaches, such as regularizing weight changes during fine-tuning, may fail to maintain sufficiently high feature similarity with the pre-trained model, and thus could possibly lose cross-task generalization. To address this issue, we propose Speech-FT, a novel two-stage fine-tuning framework designed to maintain cross-task generalization while benefiting from fine-tuning. Speech-FT first applies fine-tuning specifically designed to reduce representational drift, followed by weight-space interpolation with the pre-trained model to restore cross-task generalization. Extensive experiments on HuBERT, wav2vec 2.0, DeCoAR 2.0, and WavLM Base+ demonstrate that Speech-FT consistently improves performance across a wide range of supervised, unsupervised, and multitask fine-tuning scenarios. Moreover, Speech-FT achieves superior cross-task generalization compared to fine-tuning baselines that explicitly constrain weight changes, such as weight-space regularization and LoRA fine-tuning. Our analysis reveals that Speech-FT maintains higher feature similarity to the pre-trained model compared to alternative strategies, despite allowing larger weight-space updates. Notably, Speech-FT achieves significant improvements on the SUPERB benchmark. For example, when fine-tuning HuBERT on automatic speech recognition, Speech-FT is able to reduce phone error rate from 5.17% to 3.94%, lower word error rate from 6.38% to 5.75%, and increase speaker identification accuracy from 81.86% to 84.11%. Speech-FT provides a simple yet powerful solution for further refining speech representation models after pre-training.</description>

      <title>Multi-Step Alignment as Markov Games: An Optimistic Online Gradient Descent Approach with Convergence Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been highly successful in aligning large language models with human preferences. While prevalent methods like DPO have demonstrated strong performance, they frame interactions with the language model as a bandit problem, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where multi-turn conversations are common. Additionally, DPO relies on the Bradley-Terry model assumption, which does not adequately capture the non-transitive nature of human preferences. In this paper, we address these challenges by modeling the alignment problem as a two-player constant-sum Markov game, where each player seeks to maximize their winning rate against the other across all steps of the conversation. Our approach Optimistic Multi-step Preference Optimization (OMPO) is built upon the optimistic online mirror descent algorithm~\citep{rakhlin2013online,joulani17a}. Theoretically, we provide a rigorous analysis for the convergence of OMPO and show that OMPO requires $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ policy updates to converge to an $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium. We also validate the effectiveness of our method on multi-turn conversations dataset and math reasoning dataset.</description>

      <title>Conditioning LLMs to Generate Code-Switched Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Code-switching (CS) is still a critical challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to interpret and generate code-switched text, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale CS datasets for training. This paper presents a novel methodology to generate CS data using LLMs, and test it on the English-Spanish language pair. We propose back-translating natural CS sentences into monolingual English, and using the resulting parallel corpus to fine-tune LLMs to turn monolingual sentences into CS. Unlike previous approaches to CS generation, our methodology uses natural CS data as a starting point, allowing models to learn its natural distribution beyond grammatical patterns. We thoroughly analyse the models' performance through a study on human preferences, a qualitative error analysis and an evaluation with popular automatic metrics. Results show that our methodology generates fluent code-switched text, expanding research opportunities in CS communication, and that traditional metrics do not correlate with human judgement when assessing the quality of the generated CS data. We release our code and generated dataset under a CC-BY-NC-SA license.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-Ratio Regularized Quantile Regression: Adapting Conformal Prediction to High-Dimensional Covariate Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of conformal prediction under covariate shift. Given labeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a covariate shifted target domain, we seek to construct prediction sets with valid marginal coverage in the target domain. Most existing methods require estimating the unknown likelihood ratio function, which can be prohibitive for high-dimensional data such as images. To address this challenge, we introduce the likelihood ratio regularized quantile regression (LR-QR) algorithm, which combines the pinball loss with a novel choice of regularization in order to construct a threshold function without directly estimating the unknown likelihood ratio. We show that the LR-QR method has coverage at the desired level in the target domain, up to a small error term that we can control. Our proofs draw on a novel analysis of coverage via stability bounds from learning theory. Our experiments demonstrate that the LR-QR algorithm outperforms existing methods on high-dimensional prediction tasks, including a regression task for the Communities and Crime dataset, an image classification task from the WILDS repository, and an LLM question-answering task on the MMLU benchmark.</description>

      <title>Natural Language Generation from Visual Events: Challenges and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to use natural language to talk about visual events is at the core of human intelligence and a crucial feature of any artificial intelligence system. In recent years, a substantial body of work in visually grounded NLP has focused on describing content depicted in single images. By contrast, comparatively less attention has been devoted to exhaustively modeling scenarios in which natural language is employed to interpret and talk about events presented through videos or sequences of images. In this position paper, we argue that any NLG task dealing with sequences of images or frames is an instance of the broader, more general problem of modeling the intricate relationships between visual events unfolding over time and the features of the language used to interpret, describe, or narrate them. Therefore, solving these tasks requires models to be capable of identifying and managing such intricacies. We consider five seemingly different tasks, which we argue are compelling instances of this broader multimodal problem. Consistently, we claim that these tasks pose a common set of challenges and share similarities in terms of modeling and evaluation approaches. Building on this perspective, we identify key open questions and propose several research directions for future investigation. We claim that improving language-and-vision models' understanding of visual events is both timely and essential, given their growing applications. Additionally, this challenge offers significant scientific insight, advancing model development through principles of human cognition and language use.</description>

      <title>Training Turn-by-Turn Verifiers for Dialogue Tutoring Agents: The Curious Case of LLMs as Your Coding Tutors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent tutoring agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly explored to deliver personalized knowledge in areas such as language learning and science education. However, their capabilities in guiding users to solve complex real-world tasks remain underexplored. To address this limitation, in this work, we focus on coding tutoring, a challenging problem that requires tutors to proactively guide students towards completing predefined coding tasks. We propose a novel agent workflow, Trace-and-Verify (TRAVER), which combines knowledge tracing to estimate a student's knowledge state and turn-by-turn verification to ensure effective guidance toward task completion. We introduce DICT, an automatic evaluation protocol that assesses tutor agents using controlled student simulation and code generation tests. Extensive experiments reveal the challenges of coding tutoring and demonstrate that TRAVER achieves a significantly higher success rate. Although we use code tutoring as an example in this paper, our approach can be extended beyond coding, providing valuable insights into advancing tutoring agents for human task learning.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Structures: Do LLMs Capture the Fractal Complexity of Language?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language exhibits a fractal structure in its information-theoretic complexity (i.e. bits per token), with self-similarity across scales and long-range dependence (LRD). In this work, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can replicate such fractal characteristics and identify conditions-such as temperature setting and prompting method-under which they may fail. Moreover, we find that the fractal parameters observed in natural language are contained within a narrow range, whereas those of LLMs' output vary widely, suggesting that fractal parameters might prove helpful in detecting a non-trivial portion of LLM-generated texts. Notably, these findings, and many others reported in this work, are robust to the choice of the architecture; e.g. Gemini 1.0 Pro, Mistral-7B and Gemma-2B. We also release a dataset comprising of over 240,000 articles generated by various LLMs (both pretrained and instruction-tuned) with different decoding temperatures and prompting methods, along with their corresponding human-generated texts. We hope that this work highlights the complex interplay between fractal properties, prompting, and statistical mimicry in LLMs, offering insights for generating, evaluating and detecting synthetic texts.</description>

      <title>Does Reasoning Introduce Bias? A Study of Social Bias Evaluation and Mitigation in LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled automatic generation of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, leading to strong performance on tasks such as math and code. However, when reasoning steps reflect social stereotypes (e.g., those related to gender, race or age), they can reinforce harmful associations and lead to misleading conclusions. We present the first systematic evaluation of social bias within LLM-generated reasoning, using the BBQ dataset to analyze both prediction accuracy and bias. Our study spans a wide range of mainstream reasoning models, including instruction-tuned and CoT-augmented variants of DeepSeek-R1 (8B/32B), ChatGPT, and other open-source LLMs. We quantify how biased reasoning steps correlate with incorrect predictions and often lead to stereotype expression. To mitigate reasoning-induced bias, we propose Answer Distribution as Bias Proxy (ADBP), a lightweight mitigation method that detects bias by tracking how model predictions change across incremental reasoning steps. ADBP outperforms a stereotype-free baseline in most cases, mitigating bias and improving the accuracy of LLM outputs. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.</description>

      <title>CORAL: Learning Consistent Representations across Multi-step Training with Lighter Speculative Drafter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding is a powerful technique that accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by leveraging a lightweight speculative draft model. However, existing designs suffers in performance due to misalignment between training and inference. Recent methods have tried to solve this issue by adopting a multi-step training strategy, but the complex inputs of different training steps make it harder for the draft model to converge. To address this, we propose CORAL, a novel framework that improves both accuracy and efficiency in speculative drafting. CORAL introduces Cross-Step Representation Alignment, a method that enhances consistency across multiple training steps, significantly improving speculative drafting performance. Additionally, we identify the LM head as a major bottleneck in the inference speed of the draft model. We introduce a weight-grouping mechanism that selectively activates a subset of LM head parameters during inference, substantially reducing the latency of the draft model. We evaluate CORAL on three LLM families and three benchmark datasets, achieving speedup ratios of 2.50x-4.07x, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as EAGLE-2 and HASS. Our results demonstrate that CORAL effectively mitigates training-inference misalignment and delivers significant speedup for modern LLMs with large vocabularies.</description>

      <title>Cheems: A Practical Guidance for Building and Evaluating Chinese Reward Models from Scratch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, most RM research is centered on English and relies heavily on synthetic resources, which leads to limited and less reliable datasets and benchmarks for Chinese. To address this gap, we introduce CheemsBench, a fully human-annotated RM evaluation benchmark within Chinese contexts, and CheemsPreference, a large-scale and diverse preference dataset annotated through human-machine collaboration to support Chinese RM training. We systematically evaluate open-source discriminative and generative RMs on CheemsBench and observe significant limitations in their ability to capture human preferences in Chinese scenarios. Additionally, based on CheemsPreference, we construct an RM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on CheemsBench, demonstrating the necessity of human supervision in RM training. Our findings reveal that scaled AI-generated data struggles to fully capture human preferences, emphasizing the importance of high-quality human supervision in RM development.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for LLM-Based Survey Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) to simulate human responses to survey questions, and perform uncertainty quantification to gain reliable insights. Our approach converts imperfect LLM-simulated responses into confidence sets for population parameters of human responses, addressing the distribution shift between the simulated and real populations. A key innovation lies in determining the optimal number of simulated responses: too many produce overly narrow confidence sets with poor coverage, while too few yield excessively loose estimates. To resolve this, our method adaptively selects the simulation sample size, ensuring valid average-case coverage guarantees. It is broadly applicable to any LLM, irrespective of its fidelity, and any procedure for constructing confidence sets. Additionally, the selected sample size quantifies the degree of misalignment between the LLM and the target human population. We illustrate our method on real datasets and LLMs.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Structural Knowledge in Diffusion Models for Source Localization in Data-Limited Graph Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The source localization problem in graph information propagation is crucial for managing various network disruptions, from misinformation spread to infrastructure failures. While recent deep generative approaches have shown promise in this domain, their effectiveness is limited by the scarcity of real-world propagation data. This paper introduces SIDSL (\textbf{S}tructure-prior \textbf{I}nformed \textbf{D}iffusion model for \textbf{S}ource \textbf{L}ocalization), a novel framework that addresses three key challenges in limited-data scenarios: unknown propagation patterns, complex topology-propagation relationships, and class imbalance between source and non-source nodes. SIDSL incorporates topology-aware priors through graph label propagation and employs a propagation-enhanced conditional denoiser with a GNN-parameterized label propagation module (GNN-LP). Additionally, we propose a structure-prior biased denoising scheme that initializes from structure-based source estimations rather than random noise, effectively countering class imbalance issues. Experimental results across four real-world datasets demonstrate SIDSL's superior performance, achieving 7.5-13.3% improvements in F1 scores compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, when pretrained with simulation data of synthetic patterns, SIDSL maintains robust performance with only 10% of training data, surpassing baselines by more than 18.8%. These results highlight SIDSL's effectiveness in real-world applications where labeled data is scarce.</description>

      <title>Thinking like a CHEMIST: Combined Heterogeneous Embedding Model Integrating Structure and Tokens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representing molecular structures effectively in chemistry remains a challenging task. Language models and graph-based models are extensively utilized within this domain, consistently achieving state-of-the-art results across an array of tasks. However, the prevailing practice of representing chemical compounds in the SMILES format - used by most data sets and many language models - presents notable limitations as a training data format. In this study, we present a novel approach that decomposes molecules into substructures and computes descriptor-based representations for these fragments, providing more detailed and chemically relevant input for model training. We use this substructure and descriptor data as input for language model and also propose a bimodal architecture that integrates this language model with graph-based models. As LM we use RoBERTa, Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graphormer as graph ones. Our framework shows notable improvements over traditional methods in various tasks such as Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) prediction.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Help Uncover Insights about LLMs? A Large-Scale, Evolving Literature Analysis of Frontier LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18791v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surge of LLM studies makes synthesizing their findings challenging. Analysis of experimental results from literature can uncover important trends across studies, but the time-consuming nature of manual data extraction limits its use. Our study presents a semi-automated approach for literature analysis that accelerates data extraction using LLMs. It automatically identifies relevant arXiv papers, extracts experimental results and related attributes, and organizes them into a structured dataset, LLMEvalDB. We then conduct an automated literature analysis of frontier LLMs, reducing the effort of paper surveying and data extraction by more than 93% compared to manual approaches. We validate LLMEvalDB by showing that it reproduces key findings from a recent manual analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and also uncovers new insights that go beyond it, showing, for example, that in-context examples benefit coding &amp; multimodal tasks but offer limited gains in math reasoning tasks compared to zero-shot CoT. Our automatically updatable dataset enables continuous tracking of target models by extracting evaluation studies as new data becomes available. Through LLMEvalDB and empirical analysis, we provide insights into LLMs while facilitating ongoing literature analyses of their behavior.</description>

      <title>Preference-Based Gradient Estimation for ML-Guided Approximate Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems arise across a broad spectrum of domains, including medicine, logistics, and manufacturing. While exact solutions are often computationally infeasible, many practical applications require high-quality solutions within a given time budget. To address this, we propose a learning-based approach that enhances existing non-learned approximation algorithms for CO. Specifically, we parameterize these approximation algorithms and train graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict parameter values that yield near-optimal solutions. Our method is trained end-to-end in a self-supervised fashion, using a novel gradient estimation scheme that treats the approximation algorithm as a black box. This approach combines the strengths of learning and traditional algorithms: the GNN learns from data to guide the algorithm toward better solutions, while the approximation algorithm ensures feasibility. We validate our method on two well-known combinatorial optimization problems: the travelling salesman problem (TSP) and the minimum k-cut problem. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach is competitive with state-of-the-art learned CO solvers.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Tip of Efficiency: Uncovering the Submerged Threats of Jailbreak Attacks in Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have become increasingly prominent in the deployment on edge devices due to their high efficiency and low computational cost. While researchers continue to advance the capabilities of SLMs through innovative training strategies and model compression techniques, the security risks of SLMs have received considerably less attention compared to large language models (LLMs).To fill this gap, we provide a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate the security performance of 13 state-of-the-art SLMs under various jailbreak attacks. Our experiments demonstrate that most SLMs are quite susceptible to existing jailbreak attacks, while some of them are even vulnerable to direct harmful prompts.To address the safety concerns, we evaluate several representative defense methods and demonstrate their effectiveness in enhancing the security of SLMs. We further analyze the potential security degradation caused by different SLM techniques including architecture compression, quantization, knowledge distillation, and so on. We expect that our research can highlight the security challenges of SLMs and provide valuable insights to future work in developing more robust and secure SLMs.</description>

      <title>Detecting LLM-Generated Korean Text through Linguistic Feature Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) increases the difficulty of distinguishing between human-written and LLM-generated text. Detecting LLM-generated text is crucial for upholding academic integrity, preventing plagiarism, protecting copyrights, and ensuring ethical research practices. Most prior studies on detecting LLM-generated text focus primarily on English text. However, languages with distinct morphological and syntactic characteristics require specialized detection approaches. Their unique structures and usage patterns can hinder the direct application of methods primarily designed for English. Among such languages, we focus on Korean, which has relatively flexible spacing rules, a rich morphological system, and less frequent comma usage compared to English. We introduce KatFish, the first benchmark dataset for detecting LLM-generated Korean text. The dataset consists of text written by humans and generated by four LLMs across three genres.
  By examining spacing patterns, part-of-speech diversity, and comma usage, we illuminate the linguistic differences between human-written and LLM-generated Korean text. Building on these observations, we propose KatFishNet, a detection method specifically designed for the Korean language. KatFishNet achieves an average of 19.78% higher AUROC compared to the best-performing existing detection method. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/detecting_llm_generated_korean_text_through_linguistic_analysis.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media has become integral to minors' daily lives and is used for various purposes, such as making friends, exploring shared interests, and engaging in educational activities. However, the increase in screen time has also led to heightened challenges, including cyberbullying, online grooming, and exploitations posed by malicious actors. Traditional content moderation techniques have proven ineffective against exploiters' evolving tactics. To address these growing challenges, we propose the EdgeAIGuard content moderation approach that is designed to protect minors from online grooming and various forms of digital exploitation. The proposed method comprises a multi-agent architecture deployed strategically at the network edge to enable rapid detection with low latency and prevent harmful content targeting minors. The experimental results show the proposed method is significantly more effective than the existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Entailment vs. Verification for Partial-assignment Satisfiability and Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many procedures for SAT-related problems, in particular for those requiring the complete enumeration of satisfying truth assignments, rely their efficiency and effectiveness on the detection of (possibly small) partial assignments satisfying an input formula. Surprisingly, there seems to be no unique universally-agreed definition of formula satisfaction by a partial assignment in the literature. In this paper we analyze in deep the issue of satisfaction by partial assignments, raising a flag about some ambiguities and subtleties of this concept, and investigating their practical consequences. We identify two alternative notions that are implicitly used in the literature, namely verification and entailment, which coincide if applied to CNF formulas but differ and present complementary properties if applied to non-CNF or to existentially-quantified formulas. We show that, although the former is easier to check and as such is implicitly used by most current search procedures, the latter has better theoretical properties, and can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of enumeration procedures.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Models Aren't Tool-Savvy: Benchmarking Tool Retrieval for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tool learning aims to augment large language models (LLMs) with diverse tools, enabling them to act as agents for solving practical tasks. Due to the limited context length of tool-using LLMs, adopting information retrieval (IR) models to select useful tools from large toolsets is a critical initial step. However, the performance of IR models in tool retrieval tasks remains underexplored and unclear. Most tool-use benchmarks simplify this step by manually pre-annotating a small set of relevant tools for each task, which is far from the real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose ToolRet, a heterogeneous tool retrieval benchmark comprising 7.6k diverse retrieval tasks, and a corpus of 43k tools, collected from existing datasets. We benchmark six types of models on ToolRet. Surprisingly, even the models with strong performance in conventional IR benchmarks, exhibit poor performance on ToolRet. This low retrieval quality degrades the task pass rate of tool-use LLMs. As a further step, we contribute a large-scale training dataset with over 200k instances, which substantially optimizes the tool retrieval ability of IR models.</description>

      <title>PersonaX: A Recommendation Agent Oriented User Modeling Framework for Long Behavior Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: User profile embedded in the prompt template of personalized recommendation agents play a crucial role in shaping their decision-making process. High-quality user profiles are essential for aligning agent behavior with real user interests. Typically, these profiles are constructed by leveraging LLMs for user profile modeling (LLM-UM). However, this process faces several challenges: (1) LLMs struggle with long user behaviors due to context length limitations and performance degradation. (2) Existing methods often extract only partial segments from full historical behavior sequence, inevitably discarding diverse user interests embedded in the omitted content, leading to incomplete modeling and suboptimal profiling. (3) User profiling is often tightly coupled with the inference context, requiring online processing, which introduces significant latency overhead. In this paper, we propose PersonaX, an agent-agnostic LLM-UM framework to address these challenges. It augments downstream recommendation agents to achieve better recommendation performance and inference efficiency. PersonaX (a) segments complete historical behaviors into clustered groups, (b) selects multiple sub behavior sequences (SBS) with a balance of prototypicality and diversity to form a high quality core set, (c) performs offline multi-persona profiling to capture diverse user interests and generate fine grained, cached textual personas, and (d) decouples user profiling from online inference, enabling profile retrieval instead of real time generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness: using only 30 to 50% of behavioral data (sequence length 480), PersonaX enhances AgentCF by 3 to 11% and Agent4Rec by 10 to 50%. As a scalable and model-agnostic LLM-UM solution, PersonaX sets a new benchmark in scalable user modeling.</description>

      <title>Efficient Training-Free High-Resolution Synthesis with Energy Rectification in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress across various visual generation tasks. However, their performance significantly declines when generating content at resolutions higher than those used during training. Although numerous methods have been proposed to enable high-resolution generation, they all suffer from inefficiency. In this paper, we propose RectifiedHR, a straightforward and efficient solution for training-free high-resolution synthesis. Specifically, we propose a noise refresh strategy that unlocks the model's training-free high-resolution synthesis capability and improves efficiency. Additionally, we are the first to observe the phenomenon of energy decay, which may cause image blurriness during the high-resolution synthesis process. To address this issue, we introduce average latent energy analysis and find that tuning the classifier-free guidance hyperparameter can significantly improve generation performance. Our method is entirely training-free and demonstrates efficient performance. Furthermore, we show that RectifiedHR is compatible with various diffusion model techniques, enabling advanced features such as image editing, customized generation, and video synthesis. Extensive comparisons with numerous baseline methods validate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of RectifiedHR.</description>

      <title>LINGOLY-TOO: Disentangling Memorisation from Knowledge with Linguistic Templatisation and Orthographic Obfuscation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02972v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The expanding knowledge and memorisation capacity of frontier language models allows them to solve many reasoning tasks directly by exploiting prior knowledge, leading to inflated estimates of their reasoning abilities. We introduce LINGOLY-TOO, a challenging reasoning benchmark grounded in natural language and designed to counteract the effect of non-reasoning abilities on reasoning estimates. Using linguistically informed rulesets, we permute reasoning problems written in real languages to generate numerous question variations. These permutations preserve the intrinsic reasoning steps required for each solution while reducing the likelihood problems are directly solvable with models' knowledge. Experiments and analyses show that models can circumvent reasoning and answer from prior knowledge. On a metric that rewards consistent reasoning, all models perform poorly and exhibit high variance across question permutations, indicating that Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning faculty remains brittle. Overall, results on the benchmark reflect the recent progress of Inference-Time Compute (ITC) models but suggest ample room for further improvement. The benchmark is a step towards better measurement of reasoning abilities of LLMs and offers a cautionary tale on the importance of disentangling reasoning abilities from models' internalised knowledge when developing reasoning benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Not-Just-Scaling Laws: Towards a Better Understanding of the Downstream Impact of Language Model Design Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improvements in language model capabilities are often attributed to increasing model size or training data, but in some cases smaller models trained on curated data or with different architectural decisions can outperform larger ones trained on more tokens. What accounts for this? To quantify the impact of these design choices, we meta-analyze 92 open-source pretrained models across a wide array of scales, including state-of-the-art open-weights models as well as less performant models and those with less conventional design decisions. We find that by incorporating features besides model size and number of training tokens, we can achieve a relative 3-28% increase in ability to predict downstream performance compared with using scale alone. Analysis of model design decisions reveal insights into data composition, such as the trade-off between language and code tasks at 15-25\% code, as well as the better performance of some architectural decisions such as choosing rotary over learned embeddings. Broadly, our framework lays a foundation for more systematic investigation of how model development choices shape final capabilities.</description>

      <title>Learning Transformer-based World Models with Contrastive Predictive Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The DreamerV3 algorithm recently obtained remarkable performance across diverse environment domains by learning an accurate world model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Following the success of model-based reinforcement learning algorithms and the rapid adoption of the Transformer architecture for its superior training efficiency and favorable scaling properties, recent works such as STORM have proposed replacing RNN-based world models with Transformer-based world models using masked self-attention. However, despite the improved training efficiency of these methods, their impact on performance remains limited compared to the Dreamer algorithm, struggling to learn competitive Transformer-based world models. In this work, we show that the next state prediction objective adopted in previous approaches is insufficient to fully exploit the representation capabilities of Transformers. We propose to extend world model predictions to longer time horizons by introducing TWISTER (Transformer-based World model wIth contraSTivE Representations), a world model using action-conditioned Contrastive Predictive Coding to learn high-level temporal feature representations and improve the agent performance. TWISTER achieves a human-normalized mean score of 162% on the Atari 100k benchmark, setting a new record among state-of-the-art methods that do not employ look-ahead search.</description>

      <title>AI Agents Should be Regulated Based on the Extent of Their Autonomous Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This position paper argues that AI agents should be regulated by the extent to which they operate autonomously. AI agents with long-term planning and strategic capabilities can pose significant risks of human extinction and irreversible global catastrophes. While existing regulations often focus on computational scale as a proxy for potential harm, we argue that such measures are insufficient for assessing the risks posed by agents whose capabilities arise primarily from inference-time computation. To support our position, we discuss relevant regulations and recommendations from scientists regarding existential risks, as well as the advantages of using action sequences -- which reflect the degree of an agent's autonomy -- as a more suitable measure of potential impact than existing metrics that rely on observing environmental states.</description>

      <title>One-Shot is Enough: Consolidating Multi-Turn Attacks into Efficient Single-Turn Prompts for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for consolidating multi-turn adversarial ``jailbreak'' prompts into single-turn queries, significantly reducing the manual overhead required for adversarial testing of large language models (LLMs). While multi-turn human jailbreaks have been shown to yield high attack success rates, they demand considerable human effort and time. Our multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) methods -- Hyphenize, Numberize, and Pythonize -- systematically reformat multi-turn dialogues into structured single-turn prompts. Despite removing iterative back-and-forth interactions, these prompts preserve and often enhance adversarial potency: in extensive evaluations on the Multi-turn Human Jailbreak (MHJ) dataset, M2S methods achieve attack success rates from 70.6 percent to 95.9 percent across several state-of-the-art LLMs. Remarkably, the single-turn prompts outperform the original multi-turn attacks by as much as 17.5 percentage points while cutting token usage by more than half on average. Further analysis shows that embedding malicious requests in enumerated or code-like structures exploits ``contextual blindness'', bypassing both native guardrails and external input-output filters. By converting multi-turn conversations into concise single-turn prompts, the M2S framework provides a scalable tool for large-scale red teaming and reveals critical weaknesses in contemporary LLM defenses.</description>

      <title>To See a World in a Spark of Neuron: Disentangling Multi-task Interference for Training-free Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained models on targeted datasets enhances task-specific performance but often comes at the expense of generalization. Model merging techniques, which integrate multiple fine-tuned models into a single multi-task model through task arithmetic, offer a promising solution. However, task interference remains a fundamental challenge, leading to performance degradation and suboptimal merged models. Existing approaches largely overlook the fundamental roles of neurons, their connectivity, and activation, resulting in a merging process and a merged model that does not consider how neurons relay and process information. In this work, we present the first study that relies on neuronal mechanisms for model merging. We decompose task-specific representations into two complementary neuronal subspaces that regulate neuron sensitivity and input adaptability. Leveraging this decomposition, we introduce NeuroMerging, a novel merging framework developed to mitigate task interference within neuronal subspaces, enabling training-free model fusion across diverse tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that NeuroMerging achieves superior performance compared to existing methods on multi-task benchmarks across both natural language and vision domains. Our findings highlight the importance of aligning neuronal mechanisms in model merging, offering new insights into mitigating task interference and improving knowledge fusion. Code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>InftyThink: Breaking the Length Limits of Long-Context Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advanced reasoning in large language models has achieved remarkable performance on challenging tasks, but the prevailing long-context reasoning paradigm faces critical limitations: quadratic computational scaling with sequence length, reasoning constrained by maximum context boundaries, and performance degradation beyond pre-training context windows. Existing approaches primarily compress reasoning chains without addressing the fundamental scaling problem. To overcome these challenges, we introduce InftyThink, a paradigm that transforms monolithic reasoning into an iterative process with intermediate summarization. By interleaving short reasoning segments with concise progress summaries, our approach enables unbounded reasoning depth while maintaining bounded computational costs. This creates a characteristic sawtooth memory pattern that significantly reduces computational complexity compared to traditional approaches. Furthermore, we develop a methodology for reconstructing long-context reasoning datasets into our iterative format, transforming OpenR1-Math into 333K training instances. Experiments across multiple model architectures demonstrate that our approach reduces computational costs while improving performance, with Qwen2.5-Math-7B showing 3-13% improvements across MATH500, AIME24, and GPQA_diamond benchmarks. Our work challenges the assumed trade-off between reasoning depth and computational efficiency, providing a more scalable approach to complex reasoning without architectural modifications.</description>

      <title>NFIG: Autoregressive Image Generation with Next-Frequency Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive models have achieved promising results in natural language processing. However, for image generation tasks, they encounter substantial challenges in effectively capturing long-range dependencies, managing computational costs, and most crucially, defining meaningful autoregressive sequences that reflect natural image hierarchies. To address these issues, we present \textbf{N}ext-\textbf{F}requency \textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}eneration (\textbf{NFIG}), a novel framework that decomposes the image generation process into multiple frequency-guided stages. Our approach first generates low-frequency components to establish global structure with fewer tokens, then progressively adds higher-frequency details, following the natural spectral hierarchy of images. This principled autoregressive sequence not only improves the quality of generated images by better capturing true causal relationships between image components, but also significantly reduces computational overhead during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFIG achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer steps, offering a more efficient solution for image generation, with 1.25$\times$ speedup compared to VAR-d20 while achieving better performance (FID: 2.81) on the ImageNet-256 benchmark. We hope that our insight of incorporating frequency-domain knowledge to guide autoregressive sequence design will shed light on future research. We will make our code publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.</description>

      <title>Language Models, Graph Searching, and Supervision Adulteration: When More Supervision is Less and How to Make More More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work concerns the path-star task, a minimal example of searching over a graph. The graph, $G$, is star-shaped with $D$ arms radiating from a start node, $s$. A language model (LM) is given $G$, $s$, and a target node $t$, which ends one of the arms and is tasked with generating the arm containing $t$. The minimal nature of this task means only a single choice needs to be made: which of the $D$ arms contains $t$?
  Decoder-only LMs fail to solve this elementary task above $1/D$ chance due to a learned shortcut that absorbs training supervision. We show how this pathology is caused by excess supervision and we present a series of solutions demonstrating that the task is solvable via decoder-only LMs. We find that the task's minimal nature causes its difficulty, as it prevents task decomposition. Our solutions provide insight into the pathology and its implications for LMs trained via next-token prediction.</description>

      <title>Pruning the Paradox: How CLIP's Most Informative Heads Enhance Performance While Amplifying Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CLIP is one of the most popular foundational models and is heavily used for many vision-language tasks. However, little is known about the inner workings of CLIP. While recent work has proposed decomposition-based interpretability methods for identifying textual descriptions of attention heads in CLIP, the implications of conceptual consistency in these text labels on interpretability and model performance has not been explored. To bridge this gap, we study the conceptual consistency of text descriptions for attention heads in CLIP-like models. We conduct extensive experiments on six different models from OpenAI and OpenCLIP which vary by size, type of pre-training data and patch size. We propose Concept Consistency Score (CCS), a novel interpretability metric that measures how consistently individual attention heads in CLIP models align with specific concepts. To assign concept labels to heads, we use in-context learning with ChatGPT, guided by a few manually-curated examples, and validate these labels using an LLM-as-a-judge approach. Our soft-pruning experiments reveal that high CCS heads are critical for preserving model performance, as pruning them leads to a significantly larger performance drop than pruning random or low CCS heads. Notably, we find that high CCS heads capture essential concepts and play a key role in out-of-domain detection, concept-specific reasoning, and video-language understanding. Moreover, we prove that high CCS heads learn spurious correlations amplifying social biases. These results position CCS as a powerful interpretability metric exposing the paradox of performance and social biases in CLIP models.</description>

      <title>BriLLM: Brain-inspired Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11299v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reports the first brain-inspired large language model (BriLLM). This is a non-Transformer, non-GPT, non-traditional machine learning input-output controlled generative language model. The model is based on the Signal Fully-connected flowing (SiFu) definition on the directed graph in terms of the neural network, and has the interpretability of all nodes on the graph of the whole model, instead of the traditional machine learning model that only has limited interpretability at the input and output ends. In the language model scenario, the token is defined as a node in the graph. A randomly shaped or user-defined signal flow flows between nodes on the principle of "least resistance" along paths. The next token or node to be predicted or generated is the target of the signal flow. As a language model, BriLLM theoretically supports infinitely long $n$-gram models when the model size is independent of the input and predicted length of the model. The model's working signal flow provides the possibility of recall activation and innate multi-modal support similar to the cognitive patterns of the human brain. At present, we released the first BriLLM version in Chinese, with 4000 tokens, 32-dimensional node width, 16-token long sequence prediction ability, and language model prediction performance comparable to GPT-1. More computing power will help us explore the infinite possibilities depicted above.</description>

      <title>General Table Question Answering via Answer-Formula Joint Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advanced table question answering (TableQA) methods prompt large language models (LLMs) to generate answer text, SQL query, Python code, or custom operations, which impressively improve the complex reasoning problems in the TableQA task. However, these methods lack the versatility to cope with specific question types or table structures. In contrast, the Spreadsheet Formula, the widely used and well-defined operation language for tabular data, has not been thoroughly explored to solve TableQA. In this paper, we first attempt to use the Formula as the executable representation for solving complex reasoning on tables with different structures. Specifically, we construct \texttt{FromulaQA}, a large Formula-annotated TableQA dataset from existing datasets. In addition, we propose \texttt{TabAF}, a general table answering framework to solve multiple types of tasks over multiple types of tables simultaneously. Unlike existing methods, \texttt{TabAF} decodes answers and Formulas with a single LLM backbone, demonstrating great versatility and generalization. \texttt{TabAF} based on Llama3.1-70B achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the WikiTableQuestion, HiTab, and TabFact.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Angle Selection in X-Ray CT: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Optimal Stopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In industrial X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), the need for rapid in-line inspection is critical. Sparse-angle tomography plays a significant role in this by reducing the required number of projections, thereby accelerating processing and conserving resources. Most existing methods aim to balance reconstruction quality and scanning time, typically relying on fixed scan durations. Adaptive adjustment of the number of angles is essential; for instance, more angles may be required for objects with complex geometries or noisier projections. The concept of optimal stopping, which dynamically adjusts this balance according to varying industrial needs, remains overlooked. Building on our previous work, we integrate optimal stopping into sequential Optimal Experimental Design (sOED) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). We propose a novel method for computing the policy gradient within the Actor-Critic framework, enabling the development of adaptive policies for informative angle selection and scan termination. Additionally, we investigate the gap between simulation and real-world applications in the context of the developed learning-based method. Our trained model, developed using synthetic data, demonstrates reliable performance when applied to experimental X-ray CT data. This approach enhances the flexibility of CT operations and expands the applicability of sparse-angle tomography in industrial settings.</description>

      <title>CompMarkGS: Robust Watermarking for Compressed 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12836v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables rapid differentiable rendering for 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, leading to its widespread commercial use. Consequently, copyright protection via watermarking has become critical. However, because 3DGS relies on millions of Gaussians, which require gigabytes of storage, efficient transfer and storage require compression. Existing 3DGS watermarking methods are vulnerable to quantization-based compression, often resulting in the loss of the embedded watermark. To address this challenge, we propose a novel watermarking method that ensures watermark robustness after model compression while maintaining high rendering quality. In detail, we incorporate a quantization distortion layer that simulates compression during training, preserving the watermark under quantization-based compression. Also, we propose a learnable watermark embedding feature that embeds the watermark into the anchor feature, ensuring structural consistency and seamless integration into the 3D scene. Furthermore, we present a frequency-aware anchor growing mechanism to enhance image quality in high-frequency regions by effectively identifying Guassians within these regions. Experimental results confirm that our method preserves the watermark and maintains superior image quality under high compression, validating it as a promising approach for a secure 3DGS model.</description>

      <title>Time-R1: Post-Training Large Vision Language Model for Temporal Video Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), the task of locating specific video segments based on language queries, is a core challenge in long-form video understanding. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown early promise in tackling TVG through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), their abilities to generalize remain limited. To address this, we propose a novel post-training framework that enhances the generalization capabilities of LVLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our contributions span three key directions: (1) Time-R1: we introduce a reasoning-guided post-training framework via RL with verifiable reward to enhance the capabilities of LVLMs on the TVG task. (2) TimeRFT: we explore data-efficient post-training strategies on our curated RL-friendly dataset, which trains the model to progressively comprehend difficult samples, leading to better generalization. (3) TVGBench: we carefully construct a small yet comprehensive benchmark for LVLM evaluation, assessing 11 types of queries and featuring balanced distributions across both videos and queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream datasets using only 2.5K training data, while improving its general video understanding capabilities.</description>

      <title>COPA: Comparing the incomparable in multi-objective model evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As machine learning (ML) practitioners, we often have hundreds of (trained) ML models at hand from which we need to choose one, based on various objectives such as accuracy, robustness, fairness, scalability, etc. However, how to compare, aggregate and, ultimately, trade-off these objectives is usually a time-consuming task that requires of expert knowledge, as they may be measured in different units or scales. In this work, we investigate how objectives can be automatically normalized and aggregated to systematically navigate their Pareto front. To do so, we make incomparable objectives comparable using their CDFs, approximated by their relative rankings. As a result, we can aggregate them while matching user-specific preferences, allowing practitioners to meaningfully navigate and search for models in the Pareto front. We demonstrate the potential impact of our approach, COPA, in both model selection and benchmarking tasks across diverse ML areas such as fair ML, domain generalization, AutoML and foundation models, where classical ways to normalize and aggregate objectives fall short.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Decomposition for Optimal Claim Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current research on the \textit{Decompose-Then-Verify} paradigm for evaluating the factuality of long-form text typically treats decomposition and verification in isolation, overlooking their interactions and potential misalignment. We find that existing decomposition policies, typically hand-crafted demonstrations, do not align well with downstream verifiers in terms of atomicity -- a novel metric quantifying information density -- leading to suboptimal verification results. We formulate finding the optimal decomposition policy for optimal verification as a bilevel optimization problem. To approximate a solution for this strongly NP-hard problem, we propose dynamic decomposition, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifier feedback to learn a policy for dynamically decomposing claims to verifier-preferred atomicity. Experimental results show that dynamic decomposition outperforms existing decomposition policies, improving verification confidence by 0.07 and accuracy by 0.12 (on a 0-1 scale) on average across varying verifiers, datasets, and atomcities of input claims.</description>

      <title>On The Sample Complexity Bounds In Bilevel Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilevel reinforcement learning (BRL) has emerged as a powerful framework for aligning generative models, yet its theoretical foundations, especially sample complexity bounds, remain underexplored. In this work, we present the first sample complexity bound for BRL, establishing a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ in continuous state-action spaces. Traditional MDP analysis techniques do not extend to BRL due to its nested structure and non-convex lower-level problems. We overcome these challenges by leveraging the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition and the MDP structure to obtain closed-form gradients, enabling tight sample complexity analysis. Our analysis also extends to general bi-level optimization settings with non-convex lower levels, where we achieve state-of-the-art sample complexity results of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ improving upon existing bounds of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-6})$. Additionally, we address the computational bottleneck of hypergradient estimation by proposing a fully first-order, Hessian-free algorithm suitable for large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>EvAnimate: Event-conditioned Image-to-Video Generation for Human Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conditional human animation traditionally animates static reference images using pose-based motion cues extracted from video data. However, these video-derived cues often suffer from low temporal resolution, motion blur, and unreliable performance under challenging lighting conditions. In contrast, event cameras inherently provide robust and high temporal-resolution motion information, offering resilience to motion blur, low-light environments, and exposure variations. In this paper, we propose EvAnimate, the first method leveraging event streams as robust and precise motion cues for conditional human image animation. Our approach is fully compatible with diffusion-based generative models, enabled by encoding asynchronous event data into a specialized three-channel representation with adaptive slicing rates and densities. High-quality and temporally coherent animations are achieved through a dual-branch architecture explicitly designed to exploit event-driven dynamics, significantly enhancing performance under challenging real-world conditions. Enhanced cross-subject generalization is further achieved using specialized augmentation strategies. To facilitate future research, we establish a new benchmarking, including simulated event data for training and validation, and a real-world event dataset capturing human actions under normal and challenging scenarios. The experiment results demonstrate that EvAnimate achieves high temporal fidelity and robust performance in scenarios where traditional video-derived cues fall short.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Walker: Geometry-aware VLMs For Galaxy-scale Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) develop patch embedding and convolution backbone within vector space, especially Euclidean ones, at the very founding. When expanding VLMs to a galaxy scale for understanding astronomical phenomena, the integration of spherical space for planetary orbits and hyperbolic spaces for black holes raises two formidable challenges. a) The current pre-training model is confined to Euclidean space rather than a comprehensive geometric embedding. b) The predominant architecture lacks suitable backbones for anisotropic physical geometries. In this paper, we introduced Galaxy-Walker, a geometry-aware VLM, for the universe-level vision understanding tasks. We proposed the geometry prompt that generates geometry tokens by random walks across diverse spaces on a multi-scale physical graph, along with a geometry adapter that compresses and reshapes the space anisotropy in a mixture-of-experts manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with Galaxy-Walker achieving state-of-the-art performance in both galaxy property estimation ($R^2$ scores up to $0.91$) and morphology classification tasks (up to $+0.17$ F1 improvement in challenging features), significantly outperforming both domain-specific models and general-purpose VLMs.</description>

      <title>AI Identity, Empowerment, and Mindfulness in Mitigating Unethical AI Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines how AI identity influences psychological empowerment and unethical AI behavior among college students, while also exploring the moderating role of IT mindfulness. Findings show that a strong AI identity enhances psychological empowerment and academic engagement but can also lead to increased unethical AI practices. Crucially, IT mindfulness acts as an ethical safeguard, promoting sensitivity to ethical concerns and reducing misuse of AI. These insights have implications for educators, policymakers, and AI developers, emphasizing For Peer Review the need for a balanced approach that encourages digital engagement without compromising student responsibility. The study also contributes to philosophical discussions of psychological agency, suggesting that empowerment through AI can yield both positive and negative outcomes. Mindfulness emerges as essential in guiding ethical AI interactions. Overall, the research informs ongoing debates on ethics in education and AI, offering strategies to align technological advancement with ethical accountability and responsible use.</description>

      <title>CITRAS: Covariate-Informed Transformer for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In practical time series forecasting, covariates provide rich contextual information that can potentially enhance the forecast of target variables. Although some covariates extend into the future forecasting horizon (e.g., calendar events, discount schedules), most multivariate models fail to leverage this pivotal insight due to the length discrepancy with target variables. Additionally, capturing the dependency between target variables and covariates is non-trivial, as models must precisely reflect the local impact of covariates while also capturing global cross-variate dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we propose CITRAS, a decoder-only Transformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets, past covariates, and future covariates. While preserving strong autoregressive capabilities, CITRAS introduces two novel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift and Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future covariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent dependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing refines locally accurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level dependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally, CITRAS outperforms state-of-the-art models on thirteen real-world benchmarks from both covariate-informed and multivariate settings, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage cross-variate and cross-time dependencies for improved forecasting accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00142v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While hyperbolic GNNs show promise for hierarchical data, they often have limited discriminative power compared to Euclidean counterparts or the WL test, due to non-injective aggregation. To address this expressivity gap, we propose the Lorentzian Graph Isomorphic Network (LGIN), a novel HGNN designed for enhanced discrimination within the Lorentzian model. LGIN introduces a new update rule that preserves the Lorentzian metric while effectively capturing richer structural information. This marks a significant step towards more expressive GNNs on Riemannian manifolds. Extensive evaluations across nine benchmark datasets demonstrate LGIN's superior performance, consistently outperforming or matching state-of-the-art hyperbolic and Euclidean baselines, showcasing its ability to capture complex graph structures. LGIN is the first to adapt principles of powerful, highly discriminative GNN architectures to a Riemannian manifold.

      <title>An Introductory Survey to Autoencoder-based Deep Clustering -- Sandboxes for Combining Clustering with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoencoders offer a general way of learning low-dimensional, non-linear representations from data without labels. This is achieved without making any particular assumptions about the data type or other domain knowledge. The generality and domain agnosticism in combination with their simplicity make autoencoders a perfect sandbox for researching and developing novel (deep) clustering algorithms. Clustering methods group data based on similarity, a task that benefits from the lower-dimensional representation learned by an autoencoder, mitigating the curse of dimensionality. Specifically, the combination of deep learning with clustering, called Deep Clustering, enables to learn a representation tailored to specific clustering tasks, leading to high-quality results. This survey provides an introduction to fundamental autoencoder-based deep clustering algorithms that serve as building blocks for many modern approaches.</description>

      <title>Pre-training Generative Recommender with Multi-Identifier Item Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative recommendation autoregressively generates item identifiers to recommend potential items. Existing methods typically adopt a one-to-one mapping strategy, where each item is represented by a single identifier. However, this scheme poses issues, such as suboptimal semantic modeling for low-frequency items and limited diversity in token sequence data. To overcome these limitations, we propose MTGRec, which leverages Multi-identifier item Tokenization to augment token sequence data for Generative Recommender pre-training. Our approach involves two key innovations: multi-identifier item tokenization and curriculum recommender pre-training. For multi-identifier item tokenization, we leverage the RQ-VAE as the tokenizer backbone and treat model checkpoints from adjacent training epochs as semantically relevant tokenizers. This allows each item to be associated with multiple identifiers, enabling a single user interaction sequence to be converted into several token sequences as different data groups. For curriculum recommender pre-training, we introduce a curriculum learning scheme guided by data influence estimation, dynamically adjusting the sampling probability of each data group during recommender pre-training. After pre-training, we fine-tune the model using a single tokenizer to ensure accurate item identification for recommendation. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that MTGRec significantly outperforms both traditional and generative recommendation baselines in terms of effectiveness and scalability.</description>

      <title>Universal Item Tokenization for Transferable Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, attracting significant research attention. The basic framework involves an item tokenizer, which represents each item as a sequence of codes serving as its identifier, and a generative recommender that predicts the next item by autoregressively generating the target item identifier. However, in existing methods, both the tokenizer and the recommender are typically domain-specific, limiting their ability for effective transfer or adaptation to new domains. To this end, we propose UTGRec, a Universal item Tokenization approach for transferable Generative Recommendation. Specifically, we design a universal item tokenizer for encoding rich item semantics by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM). By devising tree-structured codebooks, we discretize content representations into corresponding codes for item tokenization. To effectively learn the universal item tokenizer on multiple domains, we introduce two key techniques in our approach. For raw content reconstruction, we employ dual lightweight decoders to reconstruct item text and images from discrete representations to capture general knowledge embedded in the content. For collaborative knowledge integration, we assume that co-occurring items are similar and integrate collaborative signals through co-occurrence alignment and reconstruction. Finally, we present a joint learning framework to pre-train and adapt the transferable generative recommender across multiple domains. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of UTGRec compared to both traditional and generative recommendation baselines.</description>

      <title>LoopGen: Training-Free Loopable Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Loops--short audio segments designed for seamless repetition--are central to many music genres, particularly those rooted in dance and electronic styles. However, current generative music models struggle to produce truly loopable audio, as generating a short waveform alone does not guarantee a smooth transition from its endpoint back to its start, often resulting in audible discontinuities. We address this gap by modifying a non-autoregressive model (MAGNeT) to generate tokens in a circular pattern, letting the model attend to the beginning of the audio when creating its ending. This inference-only approach results in generations that are aware of future context and loop naturally, without the need for any additional training or data. We evaluate the consistency of loop transitions by computing token perplexity around the seam of the loop, observing a 55% improvement. Blind listening tests further confirm significant perceptual gains over baseline methods, improving mean ratings by 70%. Taken together, these results highlight the effectiveness of inference-only approaches in improving generative models and underscore the advantages of non-autoregressive methods for context-aware music generation.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Intrinsic Ethical Vulnerability of Aligned Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05050v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are foundational explorations to artificial general intelligence, yet their alignment with human values via instruction tuning and preference learning achieves only superficial compliance. Here, we demonstrate that harmful knowledge embedded during pretraining persists as indelible "dark patterns" in LLMs' parametric memory, evading alignment safeguards and resurfacing under adversarial inducement at distributional shifts. In this study, we first theoretically analyze the intrinsic ethical vulnerability of aligned LLMs by proving that current alignment methods yield only local "safety regions" in the knowledge manifold. In contrast, pretrained knowledge remains globally connected to harmful concepts via high-likelihood adversarial trajectories. Building on this theoretical insight, we empirically validate our findings by employing semantic coherence inducement under distributional shifts--a method that systematically bypasses alignment constraints through optimized adversarial prompts. This combined theoretical and empirical approach achieves a 100% attack success rate across 19 out of 23 state-of-the-art aligned LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and LLaMA-3, revealing their universal vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>Societal Impacts Research Requires Benchmarks for Creative Composition Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models that are capable of automating cognitive tasks represent a pivotal technological shift, yet their societal implications remain unclear. These systems promise exciting advances, yet they also risk flooding our information ecosystem with formulaic, homogeneous, and potentially misleading synthetic content. Developing benchmarks grounded in real use cases where these risks are most significant is therefore critical. Through a thematic analysis using 2 million language model user prompts, we identify creative composition tasks as a prevalent usage category where users seek help with personal tasks that require everyday creativity. Our fine-grained analysis identifies mismatches between current benchmarks and usage patterns among these tasks. Crucially, we argue that the same use cases that currently lack thorough evaluations can lead to negative downstream impacts. This position paper argues that benchmarks focused on creative composition tasks is a necessary step towards understanding the societal harms of AI-generated content. We call for greater transparency in usage patterns to inform the development of new benchmarks that can effectively measure both the progress and the impacts of models with creative capabilities.</description>

      <title>MOSAIC: Modeling Social AI for Content Dissemination and Regulation in Multi-Agent Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel, open-source social network simulation framework, MOSAIC, where generative language agents predict user behaviors such as liking, sharing, and flagging content. This simulation combines LLM agents with a directed social graph to analyze emergent deception behaviors and gain a better understanding of how users determine the veracity of online social content. By constructing user representations from diverse fine-grained personas, our system enables multi-agent simulations that model content dissemination and engagement dynamics at scale. Within this framework, we evaluate three different content moderation strategies with simulated misinformation dissemination, and we find that they not only mitigate the spread of non-factual content but also increase user engagement. In addition, we analyze the trajectories of popular content in our simulations, and explore whether simulation agents' articulated reasoning for their social interactions truly aligns with their collective engagement patterns. We open-source our simulation software to encourage further research within AI and social sciences.</description>

      <title>Neural Encoding and Decoding at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08201v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that large-scale, multi-animal models are powerful tools for characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior. Current large-scale approaches, however, focus exclusively on either predicting neural activity from behavior (encoding) or predicting behavior from neural activity (decoding), limiting their ability to capture the bidirectional relationship between neural activity and behavior. To bridge this gap, we introduce a multimodal, multi-task model that enables simultaneous Neural Encoding and Decoding at Scale (NEDS). Central to our approach is a novel multi-task-masking strategy, which alternates between neural, behavioral, within-modality, and cross-modality masking. We pretrain our method on the International Brain Laboratory (IBL) repeated site dataset, which includes recordings from 83 animals performing the same visual decision-making task. In comparison to other large-scale models, we demonstrate that NEDS achieves state-of-the-art performance for both encoding and decoding when pretrained on multi-animal data and then fine-tuned on new animals. Surprisingly, NEDS's learned embeddings exhibit emergent properties: even without explicit training, they are highly predictive of the brain regions in each recording. Altogether, our approach is a step towards a foundation model of the brain that enables seamless translation between neural activity and behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-quality code documentation is crucial for software development especially in the era of AI. However, generating it automatically using Large Language Models (LLMs) remains challenging, as existing approaches often produce incomplete, unhelpful, or factually incorrect outputs. We introduce DocAgent, a novel multi-agent collaborative system using topological code processing for incremental context building. Specialized agents (Reader, Searcher, Writer, Verifier, Orchestrator) then collaboratively generate documentation. We also propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework assessing Completeness, Helpfulness, and Truthfulness. Comprehensive experiments show DocAgent significantly outperforms baselines consistently. Our ablation study confirms the vital role of the topological processing order. DocAgent offers a robust approach for reliable code documentation generation in complex and proprietary repositories.</description>

      <title>IGL-DT: Iterative Global-Local Feature Learning with Dual-Teacher Semantic Segmentation Framework under Limited Annotation Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (SSSS) aims to improve segmentation accuracy by leveraging a small set of labeled images alongside a larger pool of unlabeled data. Recent advances primarily focus on pseudo-labeling, consistency regularization, and co-training strategies. However, existing methods struggle to balance global semantic representation with fine-grained local feature extraction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel tri-branch semi-supervised segmentation framework incorporating a dual-teacher strategy, named IGL-DT. Our approach employs SwinUnet for high-level semantic guidance through Global Context Learning and ResUnet for detailed feature refinement via Local Regional Learning. Additionally, a Discrepancy Learning mechanism mitigates over-reliance on a single teacher, promoting adaptive feature learning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior segmentation performance across various data regimes.</description>

      <title>DMAGaze: Gaze Estimation Based on Feature Disentanglement and Multi-Scale Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaze estimation, which predicts gaze direction, commonly faces the challenge of interference from complex gaze-irrelevant information in face images. In this work, we propose DMAGaze, a novel gaze estimation framework that exploits information from facial images in three aspects: gaze-relevant global features (disentangled from facial image), local eye features (extracted from cropped eye patch), and head pose estimation features, to improve overall performance. Firstly, we design a new continuous mask-based Disentangler to accurately disentangle gaze-relevant and gaze-irrelevant information in facial images by achieving the dual-branch disentanglement goal through separately reconstructing the eye and non-eye regions. Furthermore, we introduce a new cascaded attention module named Multi-Scale Global Local Attention Module (MS-GLAM). Through a customized cascaded attention structure, it effectively focuses on global and local information at multiple scales, further enhancing the information from the Disentangler. Finally, the global gaze-relevant features disentangled by the upper face branch, combined with head pose and local eye features, are passed through the detection head for high-precision gaze estimation. Our proposed DMAGaze has been extensively validated on two mainstream public datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: TextArena is an open-source collection of competitive text-based games for training and evaluation of agentic behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs). It spans 57+ unique environments (including single-player, two-player, and multi-player setups) and allows for easy evaluation of model capabilities via an online-play system (against humans and other submitted models) with real-time TrueSkill scores. Traditional benchmarks rarely assess dynamic social skills such as negotiation, theory of mind, and deception, creating a gap that TextArena addresses. Designed with research, community and extensibility in mind, TextArena emphasizes ease of adding new games, adapting the framework, testing models, playing against the models, and training models. Detailed documentation of environments, games, leaderboard, and examples are available on https://github.com/LeonGuertler/TextArena and https://www.textarena.ai/.</description>

      <title>Mirror: Multimodal Cognitive Reframing Therapy for Rolling with Resistance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) in psychotherapy; however, text-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) models often struggle with client resistance, which can weaken therapeutic alliance. To address this, we propose a multimodal approach that incorporates nonverbal cues, which allows the AI therapist to better align its responses with the client's negative emotional state. Specifically, we introduce a new synthetic dataset, Mirror (Multimodal Interactive Rolling with Resistance), which is a novel synthetic dataset that pairs each client's statements with corresponding facial images. Using this dataset, we train baseline vision language models (VLMs) so that they can analyze facial cues, infer emotions, and generate empathetic responses to effectively manage client resistance. These models are then evaluated in terms of both their counseling skills as a therapist, and the strength of therapeutic alliance in the presence of client resistance. Our results demonstrate that Mirror significantly enhances the AI therapist's ability to handle resistance, which outperforms existing text-based CBT approaches. Human expert evaluations further confirm the effectiveness of our approach in managing client resistance and fostering therapeutic alliance.</description>

      <title>Beyond One-Hot Labels: Semantic Mixing for Model Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model calibration seeks to ensure that models produce confidence scores that accurately reflect the true likelihood of their predictions being correct. However, existing calibration approaches are fundamentally tied to datasets of one-hot labels implicitly assuming full certainty in all the annotations. Such datasets are effective for classification but provides insufficient knowledge of uncertainty for model calibration, necessitating the curation of datasets with numerically rich ground-truth confidence values. However, due to the scarcity of uncertain visual examples, such samples are not easily available as real datasets. In this paper, we introduce calibration-aware data augmentation to create synthetic datasets of diverse samples and their ground-truth uncertainty. Specifically, we present \textbf{Calibration-aware Semantic Mixing (CSM)}, a novel framework that generates training samples with mixed class characteristics and annotates them with distinct confidence scores via diffusion models. Based on this framework, we propose calibrated reannotation to tackle the misalignment between the annotated confidence score and the mixing ratio during the diffusion reverse process. Besides, we explore the loss functions that better fit the new data representation paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that CSM achieves superior calibration compared to the state-of-the-art calibration approaches. Our code is \href{https://github.com/E-Galois/CSM}{available here}.</description>

      <title>Empirical Evaluation of Knowledge Distillation from Transformers to Subquadratic Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a widely used technique for compressing large language models (LLMs), in which a smaller student model is trained to mimic a larger teacher model. Typically, both the teacher and student models are Transformer-based architectures, leveraging softmax attention for sequence modeling. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention during inference remains a significant bottleneck, motivating the exploration of subquadratic alternatives such as structured state-space models (SSMs), linear attention, and recurrent architectures. In this work, we systematically evaluate the transferability of knowledge distillation from a Transformer teacher model to eight subquadratic student architectures. Our study investigates which subquadratic model can most effectively approximate the teacher model's learned representations through knowledge distillation, and how different architectural design choices influence the training dynamics. We further investigate the impact of initialization strategies, such as matrix mixing and query-key-value (QKV) copying, on the adaptation process. Our empirical results on multiple NLP benchmarks provide insights into the trade-offs between efficiency and performance, highlighting key factors for successful knowledge transfer to subquadratic architectures.</description>

      <title>Roll the dice &amp; look before you leap: Going beyond the creative limits of next-token prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design a suite of minimal algorithmic tasks that are a loose abstraction of open-ended real-world tasks. This allows us to cleanly and controllably quantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like real-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our tasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a) discovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay, drawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in designing math problems or new proteins). In these tasks, we empirically and conceptually argue how next-token learning is myopic and memorizes excessively; multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and diffusion models, comparatively excel in producing diverse and original output. Secondly, to elicit randomness without hurting coherence, we find that injecting noise at the input layer (dubbed as seed-conditioning) works surprisingly as well as (and in some conditions, better than) temperature sampling from the output layer. Thus, our work offers a principled, minimal test-bed for analyzing open-ended creative skills, and offers new arguments for going beyond next-token learning and temperature sampling. We make part of the code available under https://github.com/chenwu98/algorithmic-creativity</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drug discovery requires a tremendous amount of time and cost. Computational drug-target interaction prediction, a significant part of this process, can reduce these requirements by narrowing the search space for wet lab experiments. In this survey, we provide comprehensive details of graph machine learning-based methods in predicting drug-target interaction, as they have shown promising results in this field. These details include the overall framework, main contribution, datasets, and their source codes. The selected papers were mainly published from 2020 to 2024. Prior to discussing papers, we briefly introduce the datasets commonly used with these methods and measurements to assess their performance. Finally, future challenges and some crucial areas that need to be explored are discussed.</description>

      <title>PINN-MEP: Continuous Neural Representations for Minimum-Energy Path Discovery in Molecular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16381v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing conformational transitions in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge in the computational sciences. Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.</description>

      <title>BackSlash: Rate Constrained Optimized Training of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large-language models (LLMs) has driven extensive research into parameter compression after training has been completed, yet compression during the training phase remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce Rate-Constrained Training (BackSlash), a novel training-time compression approach based on rate-distortion optimization (RDO). BackSlash enables a flexible trade-off between model accuracy and complexity, significantly reducing parameter redundancy while preserving performance. Experiments in various architectures and tasks demonstrate that BackSlash can reduce memory usage by 60% - 90% without accuracy loss and provides significant compression gain compared to compression after training. Moreover, BackSlash proves to be highly versatile: it enhances generalization with small Lagrange multipliers, improves model robustness to pruning (maintaining accuracy even at 80% pruning rates), and enables network simplification for accelerated inference on edge devices.</description>

      <title>Robo-Troj: Attacking LLM-based Task Planners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robots need task planning methods to achieve goals that require more than individual actions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in task planning. LLMs can generate a step-by-step solution using a description of actions and the goal. Despite the successes in LLM-based task planning, there is limited research studying the security aspects of those systems. In this paper, we develop Robo-Troj, the first multi-trigger backdoor attack for LLM-based task planners, which is the main contribution of this work. As a multi-trigger attack, Robo-Troj is trained to accommodate the diversity of robot application domains. For instance, one can use unique trigger words, e.g., "herical", to activate a specific malicious behavior, e.g., cutting hand on a kitchen robot. In addition, we develop an optimization method for selecting the trigger words that are most effective. Through demonstrating the vulnerability of LLM-based planners, we aim to promote the development of secured robot systems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Reset Mechanisms in Spiking Neural Networks for Sequential Modeling: Specialized Discretization for Binary Activated RNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17751v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of image recognition, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have achieved performance comparable to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). In such applications, SNNs essentially function as traditional neural networks with quantized activation values. This article focuses on an another alternative perspective,viewing SNNs as binary-activated recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential modeling tasks. From this viewpoint, current SNN architectures face several fundamental challenges in sequence modeling: (1) Traditional models lack effective memory mechanisms for long-range sequence modeling; (2) The biological-inspired components in SNNs (such as reset mechanisms and refractory period applications) remain theoretically under-explored for sequence tasks; (3) The RNN-like computational paradigm in SNNs prevents parallel training across different timesteps. To address these challenges, this study conducts a systematic analysis of the fundamental mechanisms underlying reset operations and refractory periods in binary-activated RNN-based SNN sequence models. We re-examine whether such biological mechanisms are strictly necessary for generating sparse spiking patterns, provide new theoretical explanations and insights, and ultimately propose the fixed-refractory-period SNN architecture for sequence modeling.</description>

      <title>RDI: An adversarial robustness evaluation metric for deep neural networks based on model statistical features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly susceptible to adversarial samples, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical tasks. Currently, methods of evaluating adversarial robustness are primarily categorized into attack-based and certified robustness evaluation approaches. The former not only relies on specific attack algorithms but also is highly time-consuming, while the latter due to its analytical nature, is typically difficult to implement for large and complex models. A few studies evaluate model robustness based on the model's decision boundary, but they suffer from low evaluation accuracy. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel adversarial robustness evaluation metric, Robustness Difference Index (RDI), which is based on model statistical features. RDI draws inspiration from clustering evaluation by analyzing the intra-class and inter-class distances of feature vectors separated by the decision boundary to quantify model robustness. It is attack-independent and has high computational efficiency. Experiments show that, RDI demonstrates a stronger correlation with the gold-standard adversarial robustness metric of attack success rate (ASR). The average computation time of RDI is only 1/30 of the evaluation method based on the PGD attack. Our open-source code is available at: https://github.com/BUPTAIOC/RDI.</description>

      <title>TeleSparse: Practical Privacy-Preserving Verification of Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Verification of the integrity of deep learning inference is crucial for understanding whether a model is being applied correctly. However, such verification typically requires access to model weights and (potentially sensitive or private) training data. So-called Zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (ZK-SNARKs) would appear to provide the capability to verify model inference without access to such sensitive data. However, applying ZK-SNARKs to modern neural networks, such as transformers and large vision models, introduces significant computational overhead.
  We present TeleSparse, a ZK-friendly post-processing mechanisms to produce practical solutions to this problem. TeleSparse tackles two fundamental challenges inherent in applying ZK-SNARKs to modern neural networks: (1) Reducing circuit constraints: Over-parameterized models result in numerous constraints for ZK-SNARK verification, driving up memory and proof generation costs. We address this by applying sparsification to neural network models, enhancing proof efficiency without compromising accuracy or security. (2) Minimizing the size of lookup tables required for non-linear functions, by optimizing activation ranges through neural teleportation, a novel adaptation for narrowing activation functions' range.
  TeleSparse reduces prover memory usage by 67% and proof generation time by 46% on the same model, with an accuracy trade-off of approximately 1%. We implement our framework using the Halo2 proving system and demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple architectures (Vision-transformer, ResNet, MobileNet) and datasets (ImageNet,CIFAR-10,CIFAR-100). This work opens new directions for ZK-friendly model design, moving toward scalable, resource-efficient verifiable deep learning.</description>

      <title>Explanatory Summarization with Discourse-Driven Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lay summaries for scientific documents typically include explanations to help readers grasp sophisticated concepts or arguments. However, current automatic summarization methods do not explicitly model explanations, which makes it difficult to align the proportion of explanatory content with human-written summaries. In this paper, we present a plan-based approach that leverages discourse frameworks to organize summary generation and guide explanatory sentences by prompting responses to the plan. Specifically, we propose two discourse-driven planning strategies, where the plan is conditioned as part of the input or part of the output prefix, respectively. Empirical experiments on three lay summarization datasets show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of summary quality, and it enhances model robustness, controllability, and mitigates hallucination.</description>

      <title>RAGEN: Understanding Self-Evolution in LLM Agents via Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) as interactive agents presents unique challenges including long-horizon decision making and interacting with stochastic environment feedback. While reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled progress in static tasks, multi-turn agent RL training remains underexplored. We propose StarPO (State-Thinking-Actions-Reward Policy Optimization), a general framework for trajectory-level agent RL, and introduce RAGEN, a modular system for training and evaluating LLM agents. Our study on four stylized environments reveals three core findings. First, our agent RL training shows a recurring mode of Echo Trap where reward variance cliffs and gradient spikes; we address this with StarPO-S, a stabilized variant with trajectory filtering, critic incorporation, and gradient stabilization. Second, we find the shaping of RL rollouts would benefit from diverse initial states, medium interaction granularity and more frequent sampling. Third, we show that without fine-grained, reasoning-aware reward signals, agent reasoning hardly emerge through multi-turn RL and they may show shallow strategies or hallucinated thoughts. Code and environments are available at https://github.com/RAGEN-AI/RAGEN.</description>

      <title>AutoP2C: An LLM-Based Agent Framework for Code Repository Generation from Multimodal Content in Academic Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) research is spread through academic papers featuring rich multimodal content, including text, diagrams, and tabular results. However, translating these multimodal elements into executable code remains a challenging and time-consuming process that requires substantial ML expertise. We introduce ``Paper-to-Code'' (P2C), a novel task that transforms the multimodal content of scientific publications into fully executable code repositories, which extends beyond the existing formulation of code generation that merely converts textual descriptions into isolated code snippets. To automate the P2C process, we propose AutoP2C, a multi-agent framework based on large language models that processes both textual and visual content from research papers to generate complete code repositories. Specifically, AutoP2C contains four stages: (1) repository blueprint extraction from established codebases, (2) multimodal content parsing that integrates information from text, equations, and figures, (3) hierarchical task decomposition for structured code generation, and (4) iterative feedback-driven debugging to ensure functionality and performance. Evaluation on a benchmark of eight research papers demonstrates the effectiveness of AutoP2C, which can successfully generate executable code repositories for all eight papers, while OpenAI-o1 or DeepSeek-R1 can only produce runnable code for one paper. The code is available at https://github.com/shoushouyu/Automated-Paper-to-Code.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning in Large Language Models with One Training Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward using one training example (1-shot RLVR) is effective in incentivizing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Applying RLVR to the base model Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, we identify a single example that elevates model performance on MATH500 from 36.0% to 73.6%, and improves the average performance across six common mathematical reasoning benchmarks from 17.6% to 35.7%. This result matches the performance obtained using the 1.2k DeepScaleR subset (MATH500: 73.6%, average: 35.9%), which includes the aforementioned example. Furthermore, RLVR with only two examples even slightly exceeds these results (MATH500: 74.8%, average: 36.6%). Similar substantial improvements are observed across various models (Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B), RL algorithms (GRPO and PPO), and different math examples (when employed as a single training example). In addition, we identify some interesting phenomena during 1-shot RLVR, including cross-domain generalization, increased frequency of self-reflection, and sustained test performance improvement even after the training accuracy has saturated, a phenomenon we term post-saturation generalization. Moreover, we verify that the effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR primarily arises from the policy gradient loss, distinguishing it from the "grokking" phenomenon. We also show the critical role of promoting exploration (e.g., by incorporating entropy loss with an appropriate coefficient) in 1-shot RLVR training. We also further discuss related observations about format correction, label robustness and prompt modification. These findings can inspire future work on RLVR efficiency and encourage a re-examination of recent progress and the underlying mechanisms in RLVR. Our code, model, and data are open source at https://github.com/ypwang61/One-Shot-RLVR.</description>

      <title>FedHERO: A Federated Learning Approach for Node Classification Task on Heterophilic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) empowers clients to collaboratively train Graph neural networks (GNNs) in a distributed manner while preserving data privacy. However, FGL methods usually require that the graph data owned by all clients is homophilic to ensure similar neighbor distribution patterns of nodes. Such an assumption ensures that the learned knowledge is consistent across the local models from all clients. Therefore, these local models can be properly aggregated as a global model without undermining the overall performance. Nevertheless, when the neighbor distribution patterns of nodes vary across different clients (e.g., when clients hold graphs with different levels of heterophily), their local models may gain different and even conflict knowledge from their node-level predictive tasks. Consequently, aggregating these local models usually leads to catastrophic performance deterioration on the global model. To address this challenge, we propose FedHERO, an FGL framework designed to harness and share insights from heterophilic graphs effectively. At the heart of FedHERO is a dual-channel GNN equipped with a structure learner, engineered to discern the structural knowledge encoded in the local graphs. With this specialized component, FedHERO enables the local model for each client to identify and learn patterns that are universally applicable across graphs with different patterns of node neighbor distributions. FedHERO not only enhances the performance of individual client models by leveraging both local and shared structural insights but also sets a new precedent in this field to effectively handle graph data with various node neighbor distribution patterns. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the superior performance of FedHERO against existing alternatives.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies indicate that deep neural networks degrade in generalization performance under noisy supervision. Existing methods focus on isolating clean subsets or correcting noisy labels, facing limitations such as high computational costs, heavy hyperparameter tuning process, and coarse-grained optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage noisy learning framework that enables instance-level optimization through a dynamically weighted loss function, avoiding hyperparameter tuning. To obtain stable and accurate information about noise modeling, we introduce a simple yet effective metric, termed wrong event, which dynamically models the cleanliness and difficulty of individual samples while maintaining computational costs. Our framework first collects wrong event information and builds a strong base model. Then we perform noise-robust training on the base model, using a probabilistic model to handle the wrong event information of samples. Experiments on five synthetic and real-world LNL benchmarks demonstrate our method surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance, achieves a nearly 75% reduction in computational time and improves model scalability.</description>

      <title>A Physics-preserved Transfer Learning Method for Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While data-driven methods such as neural operator have achieved great success in solving differential equations (DEs), they suffer from domain shift problems caused by different learning environments (with data bias or equation changes), which can be alleviated by transfer learning (TL). However, existing TL methods adopted in DEs problems lack either generalizability in general DEs problems or physics preservation during training. In this work, we focus on a general transfer learning method that adaptively correct the domain shift and preserve physical information. Mathematically, we characterize the data domain as product distribution and the essential problems as distribution bias and operator bias. A Physics-preserved Optimal Tensor Transport (POTT) method that simultaneously admits generalizability to common DEs and physics preservation of specific problem is proposed to adapt the data-driven model to target domain utilizing the push-forward distribution induced by the POTT map. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance, generalizability and physics preservation of the proposed POTT method.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Black-Litterman Portfolio via Hybrid Forecasting Model Combining Multivariate Decomposition and Noise Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern portfolio construction demands robust methods for integrating data-driven insights into asset allocation. The Black-Litterman model offers a powerful Bayesian approach to adjust equilibrium returns using investor views to form a posterior expectation along with market priors. Mainstream research mainly generates subjective views through statistical models or machine learning methods, among which hybrid models combined with decomposition algorithms perform well. However, most hybrid models do not pay enough attention to noise, and time series decomposition methods based on single variables make it difficult to fully utilize information between multiple variables. Multivariate decomposition also has problems of low efficiency and poor component quality. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid forecasting model SSA-MAEMD-TCN to automate and improve the view generation process. The proposed model combines Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) for denoising, Multivariate Aligned Empirical Mode Decomposition (MA-EMD) for frequency-aligned decomposition, and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) for deep sequence learning to capture complex temporal patterns across multiple financial indicators. Empirical tests on the Nasdaq 100 Index stocks show a significant improvement in forecasting performance compared to baseline models based on MAEMD and MEMD. The optimized portfolio performs well, with annualized returns and Sharpe ratios far exceeding those of the traditional portfolio over a short holding period, even after accounting for transaction costs.</description>

      <title>Intra-Layer Recurrence in Transformers for Language Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer models have established new benchmarks in natural language processing; however, their increasing depth results in substantial growth in parameter counts. While existing recurrent transformer methods address this issue by reprocessing layers multiple times, they often apply recurrence indiscriminately across entire blocks of layers. In this work, we investigate Intra-Layer Recurrence (ILR), a more targeted approach that applies recurrence selectively to individual layers within a single forward pass. Our experiments show that allocating more iterations to earlier layers yields optimal results. These findings suggest that ILR offers a promising direction for optimizing recurrent structures in transformer architectures.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Large Language Model Reasoning via Speculative Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tree-search-based reasoning methods have significantly enhanced the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by facilitating the exploration of multiple intermediate reasoning steps, i.e., thoughts. However, these methods suffer from substantial inference latency, as they have to generate numerous reasoning thoughts, severely limiting LLM applicability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Speculative Search (SpecSearch) framework that significantly accelerates LLM reasoning by optimizing thought generation. Specifically, SpecSearch utilizes a small model to strategically collaborate with a large model at both thought and token levels, efficiently generating high-quality reasoning thoughts. The major pillar of SpecSearch is a novel quality-preserving rejection mechanism, which effectively filters out thoughts whose quality falls below that of the large model's outputs. Moreover, we show that SpecSearch preserves comparable reasoning quality to the large model. Experiments on both the Qwen and Llama models demonstrate that SpecSearch significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 2.12$\times$ speedup with comparable reasoning quality.</description>

      <title>Perception-Informed Neural Networks: Beyond Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces Perception-Informed Neural Networks (PrINNs), a framework designed to incorporate perception-based information into neural networks, addressing both systems with known and unknown physics laws or differential equations. Moreover, PrINNs extend the concept of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and their variants, offering a platform for the integration of diverse forms of perception precisiation, including singular, probability distribution, possibility distribution, interval, and fuzzy graph. In fact, PrINNs allow neural networks to model dynamical systems by integrating expert knowledge and perception-based information through loss functions, enabling the creation of modern data-driven models. Some of the key contributions include Mixture of Experts Informed Neural Networks (MOEINNs), which combine heterogeneous expert knowledge into the network, and Transformed-Knowledge Informed Neural Networks (TKINNs), which facilitate the incorporation of meta-information for enhanced model performance. Additionally, Fuzzy-Informed Neural Networks (FINNs) as a modern class of fuzzy deep neural networks leverage fuzzy logic constraints within a deep learning architecture, allowing online training without pre-training and eliminating the need for defuzzification. PrINNs represent a significant step forward in bridging the gap between traditional physics-based modeling and modern data-driven approaches, enabling neural networks to learn from both structured physics laws and flexible perception-based rules. This approach empowers neural networks to operate in uncertain environments, model complex systems, and discover new forms of differential equations, making PrINNs a powerful tool for advancing computational science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Efficient Flow Matching using Latent Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flow matching models have shown great potential in image generation tasks among probabilistic generative models. However, most flow matching models in the literature do not explicitly model the underlying structure/manifold in the target data when learning the flow from a simple source distribution like the standard Gaussian. This leads to inefficient learning, especially for many high-dimensional real-world datasets, which often reside in a low-dimensional manifold. Existing strategies of incorporating manifolds, including data with underlying multi-modal distribution, often require expensive training and hence frequently lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we present $\texttt{Latent-CFM}$, which provides simplified training/inference strategies to incorporate multi-modal data structures using pretrained deep latent variable models. Through experiments on multi-modal synthetic data and widely used image benchmark datasets, we show that $\texttt{Latent-CFM}$ exhibits improved generation quality with significantly less training (up to $\sim 50\%$ less) and computation than state-of-the-art flow matching models by incorporating extracted data features using pretrained lightweight latent variable models. Moving beyond natural images to generating fields arising from processes governed by physics, using a 2d Darcy flow dataset, we demonstrate that our approach generates more physically accurate samples than competitive approaches. In addition, through latent space analysis, we demonstrate that our approach can be used for conditional image generation conditioned on latent features, which adds interpretability to the generation process.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Efficient Multivariate Time Series Forecasting via Offline Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is essential for applications such as traffic management and weather prediction, which depend on capturing long-range temporal dependencies and interactions between entities. Existing methods, particularly those based on Transformer architectures, compute pairwise dependencies across all time steps, leading to a computational complexity that scales quadratically with the length of the input. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Forecaster with Offline Clustering Using Segments (FOCUS), a novel approach to MTS forecasting that simplifies long-range dependency modeling through the use of prototypes extracted via offline clustering. These prototypes encapsulate high-level events in the real-world system underlying the data, summarizing the key characteristics of similar time segments. In the online phase, FOCUS dynamically adapts these patterns to the current input and captures dependencies between the input segment and high-level events, enabling both accurate and efficient forecasting. By identifying prototypes during the offline clustering phase, FOCUS reduces the computational complexity of modeling long-range dependencies in the online phase to linear scaling. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that FOCUS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs.</description>

      <title>Cluster-Aware Multi-Round Update for Wireless Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aggregation efficiency and accuracy of wireless Federated Learning (FL) are significantly affected by resource constraints, especially in heterogeneous environments where devices exhibit distinct data distributions and communication capabilities. This paper proposes a clustering strategy that leverages prior knowledge similarity to group devices with similar data and communication characteristics, mitigating performance degradation from heterogeneity. On this basis, a novel Cluster- Aware Multi-round Update (CAMU) strategy is proposed, which treats clusters as the basic units and adjusts the local update frequency based on the clustered contribution threshold, effectively reducing update bias and enhancing aggregation accuracy. The theoretical convergence of the CAMU strategy is rigorously validated. Meanwhile, based on the convergence upper bound, the local update frequency and transmission power of each cluster are jointly optimized to achieve an optimal balance between computation and communication resources under constrained conditions, significantly improving the convergence efficiency of FL. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the model performance of FL in heterogeneous environments and achieves a better balance between communication cost and computational load under limited resources.</description>

      <title>Towards user-centered interactive medical image segmentation in VR with an assistive AI agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07214v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crucial in disease analysis and surgical planning, manual segmentation of volumetric medical scans (e.g. MRI, CT) is laborious, error-prone, and challenging to master, while fully automatic algorithms can benefit from user feedback. Therefore, with the complementary power of the latest radiological AI foundation models and virtual reality (VR)'s intuitive data interaction, we propose SAMIRA, a novel conversational AI agent for medical VR that assists users with localizing, segmenting, and visualizing 3D medical concepts. Through speech-based interaction, the agent helps users understand radiological features, locate clinical targets, and generate segmentation masks that can be refined with just a few point prompts. The system also supports true-to-scale 3D visualization of segmented pathology to enhance patient-specific anatomical understanding. Furthermore, to determine the optimal interaction paradigm under near-far attention-switching for refining segmentation masks in an immersive, human-in-the-loop workflow, we compare VR controller pointing, head pointing, and eye tracking as input modes. With a user study, evaluations demonstrated a high usability score (SUS=90.0 $\pm$ 9.0), low overall task load, as well as strong support for the proposed VR system's guidance, training potential, and integration of AI in radiological segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>Representation Learning with Mutual Influence of Modalities for Node Classification in Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, numerous online platforms can be described as multi-modal heterogeneous networks (MMHNs), such as Douban's movie networks and Amazon's product review networks. Accurately categorizing nodes within these networks is crucial for analyzing the corresponding entities, which requires effective representation learning on nodes. However, existing multi-modal fusion methods often adopt either early fusion strategies which may lose the unique characteristics of individual modalities, or late fusion approaches overlooking the cross-modal guidance in GNN-based information propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel model for node classification in MMHNs, named Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Inter-Modal Attention (HGNN-IMA). It learns node representations by capturing the mutual influence of multiple modalities during the information propagation process, within the framework of heterogeneous graph transformer. Specifically, a nested inter-modal attention mechanism is integrated into the inter-node attention to achieve adaptive multi-modal fusion, and modality alignment is also taken into account to encourage the propagation among nodes with consistent similarities across all modalities. Moreover, an attention loss is augmented to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the model in the node classification task, providing an innovative view to handle multi-modal data, especially when accompanied with network structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) and structural features (SFs) are cornerstones for the link prediction task. However, as a common and intuitive mode of understanding, the potential of visual perception has been overlooked in the MPNN community. For the first time, we equip MPNNs with vision structural awareness by proposing an effective framework called Graph Vision Network (GVN), along with a more efficient variant (E-GVN). Extensive empirical results demonstrate that with the proposed frameworks, GVN consistently benefits from the vision enhancement across seven link prediction datasets, including challenging large-scale graphs. Such improvements are compatible with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and GVNs achieve new SOTA results, thereby underscoring a promising novel direction for link prediction.</description>

      <title>MixBridge: Heterogeneous Image-to-Image Backdoor Attack through Mixture of Schr\"odinger Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on implanting multiple heterogeneous backdoor triggers in bridge-based diffusion models designed for complex and arbitrary input distributions. Existing backdoor formulations mainly address single-attack scenarios and are limited to Gaussian noise input models. To fill this gap, we propose MixBridge, a novel diffusion Schr\"odinger bridge (DSB) framework to cater to arbitrary input distributions (taking I2I tasks as special cases). Beyond this trait, we demonstrate that backdoor triggers can be injected into MixBridge by directly training with poisoned image pairs. This eliminates the need for the cumbersome modifications to stochastic differential equations required in previous studies, providing a flexible tool to study backdoor behavior for bridge models. However, a key question arises: can a single DSB model train multiple backdoor triggers? Unfortunately, our theory shows that when attempting this, the model ends up following the geometric mean of benign and backdoored distributions, leading to performance conflict across backdoor tasks. To overcome this, we propose a Divide-and-Merge strategy to mix different bridges, where models are independently pre-trained for each specific objective (Divide) and then integrated into a unified model (Merge). In addition, a Weight Reallocation Scheme (WRS) is also designed to enhance the stealthiness of MixBridge. Empirical studies across diverse generation tasks speak to the efficacy of MixBridge.</description>

Abstract: Despite its constitutional relevance, the technical ``individual fairness'' criterion has not been operationalized in U.S. state or federal statutes/regulations. We conduct a human subjects experiment to address this gap, evaluating which demographic features are relevant for individual fairness evaluation of recidivism risk assessment (RRA) tools. Our analyses conclude that the individual similarity function should consider age and sex, but it should ignore race.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks based Video Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces an enhanced approach to video super-resolution by extending ordinary Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) structure to handle spatio-temporal data. While SRGAN has proven effective for single-image enhancement, its design does not account for the temporal continuity required in video processing. To address this, a modified framework that incorporates 3D Non-Local Blocks is proposed, which is enabling the model to capture relationships across both spatial and temporal dimensions. An experimental training pipeline is developed, based on patch-wise learning and advanced data degradation techniques, to simulate real-world video conditions and learn from both local and global structures and details. This helps the model generalize better and maintain stability across varying video content while maintaining the general structure besides the pixel-wise correctness. Two model variants-one larger and one more lightweight-are presented to explore the trade-offs between performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate improved temporal coherence, sharper textures, and fewer visual artifacts compared to traditional single-image methods. This work contributes to the development of practical, learning-based solutions for video enhancement tasks, with potential applications in streaming, gaming, and digital restoration.</description>

      <title>A Survey on the Safety and Security Threats of Computer-Using Agents: JARVIS or Ultron?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10924</link>

Abstract: Recently, AI-driven interactions with computing devices have advanced from basic prototype tools to sophisticated, LLM-based systems that emulate human-like operations in graphical user interfaces. We are now witnessing the emergence of \emph{Computer-Using Agents} (CUAs), capable of autonomously performing tasks such as navigating desktop applications, web pages, and mobile apps. However, as these agents grow in capability, they also introduce novel safety and security risks. Vulnerabilities in LLM-driven reasoning, with the added complexity of integrating multiple software components and multimodal inputs, further complicate the security landscape. In this paper, we present a systematization of knowledge on the safety and security threats of CUAs. We conduct a comprehensive literature review and distill our findings along four research objectives: \textit{\textbf{(i)}} define the CUA that suits safety analysis; \textit{\textbf{(ii)} } categorize current safety threats among CUAs; \textit{\textbf{(iii)}} propose a comprehensive taxonomy of existing defensive strategies; \textit{\textbf{(iv)}} summarize prevailing benchmarks, datasets, and evaluation metrics used to assess the safety and performance of CUAs. Building on these insights, our work provides future researchers with a structured foundation for exploring unexplored vulnerabilities and offers practitioners actionable guidance in designing and deploying secure Computer-Using Agents.</description>

      <title>GRoQ-LoCO: Generalist and Robot-agnostic Quadruped Locomotion Control using Offline Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large-scale offline training have demonstrated the potential of generalist policy learning for complex robotic tasks. However, applying these principles to legged locomotion remains a challenge due to continuous dynamics and the need for real-time adaptation across diverse terrains and robot morphologies. In this work, we propose GRoQ-LoCO, a scalable, attention-based framework that learns a single generalist locomotion policy across multiple quadruped robots and terrains, relying solely on offline datasets. Our approach leverages expert demonstrations from two distinct locomotion behaviors - stair traversal (non-periodic gaits) and flat terrain traversal (periodic gaits) - collected across multiple quadruped robots, to train a generalist model that enables behavior fusion. Crucially, our framework operates solely on proprioceptive data from all robots without incorporating any robot-specific encodings. The policy is directly deployable on an Intel i7 nuc, producing low-latency control outputs without any test-time optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate zero-shot transfer across highly diverse quadruped robots and terrains, including hardware deployment on the Unitree Go1, a commercially available 12kg robot. Notably, we evaluate challenging cross-robot training setups where different locomotion skills are unevenly distributed across robots, yet observe successful transfer of both flat walking and stair traversal behaviors to all robots at test time. We also show preliminary walking on Stoch 5, a 70kg quadruped, on flat and outdoor terrains without requiring any fine tuning. These results demonstrate the potential of offline, data-driven learning to generalize locomotion across diverse quadruped morphologies and behaviors.</description>

      <title>One Image is Worth a Thousand Words: A Usability Preservable Text-Image Collaborative Erasing Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concept erasing has recently emerged as an effective paradigm to prevent text-to-image diffusion models from generating visually undesirable or even harmful content. However, current removal methods heavily rely on manually crafted text prompts, making it challenging to achieve a high erasure (efficacy) while minimizing the impact on other benign concepts (usability). In this paper, we attribute the limitations to the inherent gap between the text and image modalities, which makes it hard to transfer the intricately entangled concept knowledge from text prompts to the image generation process. To address this, we propose a novel solution by directly integrating visual supervision into the erasure process, introducing the first text-image Collaborative Concept Erasing (Co-Erasing) framework. Specifically, Co-Erasing describes the concept jointly by text prompts and the corresponding undesirable images induced by the prompts, and then reduces the generating probability of the target concept through negative guidance. This approach effectively bypasses the knowledge gap between text and image, significantly enhancing erasure efficacy. Additionally, we design a text-guided image concept refinement strategy that directs the model to focus on visual features most relevant to the specified text concept, minimizing disruption to other benign concepts. Finally, comprehensive experiments suggest that Co-Erasing outperforms state-of-the-art erasure approaches significantly with a better trade-off between efficacy and usability.

      <title>Human-Aligned Bench: Fine-Grained Assessment of Reasoning Ability in MLLMs vs. Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is to imitate humans and surpass them. Models such as OpenAI's o1, o3, and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) with human-like reasoning capabilities exhibit exceptional performance and are being gradually integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, whether these models possess capabilities comparable to humans in handling reasoning tasks remains unclear at present. In this paper, we propose Human-Aligned Bench, a benchmark for fine-grained alignment of multimodal reasoning with human performance. Specifically, we collected 9,794 multimodal questions that solely rely on contextual reasoning, including bilingual (Chinese and English) multimodal questions and pure text-based questions, encompassing four question types: visual reasoning, definition judgment, analogical reasoning, and logical judgment. More importantly, each question is accompanied by human success rates and options that humans are prone to choosing incorrectly. Extensive experiments on the Human-Aligned Bench reveal notable differences between the performance of current MLLMs in multimodal reasoning and human performance. The findings on our benchmark provide insights into the development of the next-generation models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11365v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of large language models (LLMs) is critical for responsible deployment, yet existing evaluations often prioritize performance over identifying failure modes. We introduce Phare, a multilingual diagnostic framework to probe and evaluate LLM behavior across three critical dimensions: hallucination and reliability, social biases, and harmful content generation. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals patterns of systematic vulnerabilities across all safety dimensions, including sycophancy, prompt sensitivity, and stereotype reproduction. By highlighting these specific failure modes rather than simply ranking models, Phare provides researchers and practitioners with actionable insights to build more robust, aligned, and trustworthy language systems.</description>

      <title>ACSE-Eval: Can LLMs threat model real-world cloud infrastructure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models have shown promise in cybersecurity applications, their effectiveness in identifying security threats within cloud deployments remains unexplored. This paper introduces AWS Cloud Security Engineering Eval, a novel dataset for evaluating LLMs cloud security threat modeling capabilities. ACSE-Eval contains 100 production grade AWS deployment scenarios, each featuring detailed architectural specifications, Infrastructure as Code implementations, documented security vulnerabilities, and associated threat modeling parameters. Our dataset enables systemic assessment of LLMs abilities to identify security risks, analyze attack vectors, and propose mitigation strategies in cloud environments. Our evaluations on ACSE-Eval demonstrate that GPT 4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro excel at threat identification, with Gemini 2.5 Pro performing optimally in 0-shot scenarios and GPT 4.1 showing superior results in few-shot settings. While GPT 4.1 maintains a slight overall performance advantage, Claude 3.7 Sonnet generates the most semantically sophisticated threat models but struggles with threat categorization and generalization. To promote reproducibility and advance research in automated cybersecurity threat analysis, we open-source our dataset, evaluation metrics, and methodologies.</description>

      <title>Efficient Uncertainty Estimation via Distillation of Bayesian Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in uncertainty estimation for Large Language Models (LLMs) during downstream adaptation have addressed key challenges of reliability and simplicity. However, existing Bayesian methods typically require multiple sampling iterations during inference, creating significant efficiency issues that limit practical deployment. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of eliminating the need for test-time sampling for LLM uncertainty estimation. Specifically, when given an off-the-shelf Bayesian LLM, we distill its aligned confidence into a non-Bayesian student LLM by minimizing the divergence between their predictive distributions. Unlike typical calibration methods, our distillation is carried out solely on the training dataset without the need of an additional validation dataset. This simple yet effective approach achieves N-times more efficient uncertainty estimation during testing, where N is the number of samples traditionally required by Bayesian LLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that uncertainty estimation capabilities on training data can successfully generalize to unseen test data through our distillation technique, consistently producing results comparable to (or even better than) state-of-the-art Bayesian LLMs.</description>

      <title>Not All Thoughts are Generated Equal: Efficient LLM Reasoning via Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compressing long chain-of-thought (CoT) from large language models (LLMs) is an emerging strategy to improve the reasoning efficiency of LLMs. Despite its promising benefits, existing studies equally compress all thoughts within a long CoT, hindering more concise and effective reasoning. To this end, we first investigate the importance of different thoughts by examining their effectiveness and efficiency in contributing to reasoning through automatic long CoT chunking and Monte Carlo rollouts. Building upon the insights, we propose a theoretically bounded metric to jointly measure the effectiveness and efficiency of different thoughts. We then propose Long$\otimes$Short, an efficient reasoning framework that enables two LLMs to collaboratively solve the problem: a long-thought LLM for more effectively generating important thoughts, while a short-thought LLM for efficiently generating remaining thoughts. Specifically, we begin by synthesizing a small amount of cold-start data to fine-tune LLMs for long-thought and short-thought reasoning styles, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a synergizing-oriented multi-turn reinforcement learning, focusing on the model self-evolution and collaboration between long-thought and short-thought LLMs. Experimental results show that our method enables Qwen2.5-7B and Llama3.1-8B to achieve comparable performance compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, while reducing token length by over 80% across the MATH500, AIME24/25, AMC23, and GPQA Diamond benchmarks.

      <title>Mobile-Bench-v2: A More Realistic and Comprehensive Benchmark for VLM-based Mobile Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: VLM-based mobile agents are increasingly popular due to their capabilities to interact with smartphone GUIs and XML-structured texts and to complete daily tasks. However, existing online benchmarks struggle with obtaining stable reward signals due to dynamic environmental changes. Offline benchmarks evaluate the agents through single-path trajectories, which stands in contrast to the inherently multi-solution characteristics of GUI tasks. Additionally, both types of benchmarks fail to assess whether mobile agents can handle noise or engage in proactive interactions due to a lack of noisy apps or overly full instructions during the evaluation process. To address these limitations, we use a slot-based instruction generation method to construct a more realistic and comprehensive benchmark named Mobile-Bench-v2. Mobile-Bench-v2 includes a common task split, with offline multi-path evaluation to assess the agent's ability to obtain step rewards during task execution. It contains a noisy split based on pop-ups and ads apps, and a contaminated split named AITZ-Noise to formulate a real noisy environment. Furthermore, an ambiguous instruction split with preset Q\&amp;A interactions is released to evaluate the agent's proactive interaction capabilities. We conduct evaluations on these splits using the single-agent framework AppAgent-v1, the multi-agent framework Mobile-Agent-v2, as well as other mobile agents such as UI-Tars and OS-Atlas. Code and data are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/xwk123/MobileBench-v2.</description>

      <title>AdaCoT: Pareto-Optimal Adaptive Chain-of-Thought Triggering via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but often face challenges with tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting significantly enhances reasoning, it indiscriminately generates lengthy reasoning steps for all queries, leading to substantial computational costs and inefficiency, especially for simpler inputs. To address this critical issue, we introduce AdaCoT (Adaptive Chain-of-Thought), a novel framework enabling LLMs to adaptively decide when to invoke CoT. AdaCoT framed adaptive reasoning as a Pareto optimization problem that seeks to balance model performance with the costs associated with CoT invocation (both frequency and computational overhead). We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based method, specifically utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to dynamically control the CoT triggering decision boundary by adjusting penalty coefficients, thereby allowing the model to determine CoT necessity based on implicit query complexity. A key technical contribution is Selective Loss Masking (SLM), designed to counteract decision boundary collapse during multi-stage RL training, ensuring robust and stable adaptive triggering. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaCoT successfully navigates the Pareto frontier, achieving substantial reductions in CoT usage for queries not requiring elaborate reasoning. For instance, on our production traffic testset, AdaCoT reduced CoT triggering rates to as low as 3.18\% and decreased average response tokens by 69.06%, while maintaining high performance on complex tasks.</description>

      <title>When the Left Foot Leads to the Right Path: Bridging Initial Prejudice and Trainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the statistical properties of deep neural networks (DNNs) at initialization is crucial for elucidating both their trainability and the intrinsic architectural biases they encode prior to data exposure. Mean-field (MF) analyses have demonstrated that the parameter distribution in randomly initialized networks dictates whether gradients vanish or explode. Concurrently, untrained DNNs were found to exhibit an initial-guessing bias (IGB), in which large regions of the input space are assigned to a single class. In this work, we derive a theoretical proof establishing the correspondence between IGB and previous MF theories, thereby connecting a network prejudice toward specific classes with the conditions for fast and accurate learning. This connection yields the counter-intuitive conclusion: the initialization that optimizes trainability is necessarily biased, rather than neutral. Furthermore, we extend the MF/IGB framework to multi-node activation functions, offering practical guidelines for designing initialization schemes that ensure stable optimization in architectures employing max- and average-pooling layers.</description>

      <title>RoboFAC: A Comprehensive Framework for Robotic Failure Analysis and Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently advanced robotic manipulation by translating natural-language instructions and image information into sequential control actions. However, these models often underperform in open-world scenarios, as they are predominantly trained on successful expert demonstrations and exhibit a limited capacity for failure recovery. In this work, we present a Robotic Failure Analysis and Correction (RoboFAC) framework to address this issue. Firstly, we construct RoboFAC dataset comprising 9,440 erroneous manipulation trajectories and 78,623 QA pairs across 16 diverse tasks and 53 scenes in both simulation and real-world environments. Leveraging our dataset, we develop RoboFAC model, which is capable of Task Understanding, Failure Analysis and Failure Correction. Experimental results demonstrate that the RoboFAC model outperforms GPT-4o by 34.1% on our evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, we integrate the RoboFAC model into a real-world VLA control pipeline as an external supervision providing correction instructions, yielding a 29.1% relative improvement on average on four real-world tasks. The results show that our RoboFAC framework effectively handles robotic failures and assists the VLA model in recovering from failures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People in the real world often possess vague knowledge of future payoffs, for which quantification is not feasible or desirable. We argue that language, with differing ability to convey vague information, plays an important but less-known role in representing subjective expectations. Empirically, we find that in their reports, analysts include useful information in linguistic expressions but not numerical forecasts. Specifically, the textual tone of analyst reports has predictive power for forecast errors and subsequent revisions in numerical forecasts, and this relation becomes stronger when analyst's language is vaguer, when uncertainty is higher, and when analysts are busier. Overall, our theory and evidence suggest that some useful information is vaguely known and only communicated through language.</description>

      <title>SLOT: Sample-specific Language Model Optimization at Test-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose SLOT (Sample-specific Language Model Optimization at Test-time), a novel and parameter-efficient test-time inference approach that enhances a language model's ability to more accurately respond to individual prompts. Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex instructions, leading to poor performances on those not well represented among general samples. To address this, SLOT conducts few optimization steps at test-time to update a light-weight sample-specific parameter vector. It is added to the final hidden layer before the output head, and enables efficient adaptation by caching the last layer features during per-sample optimization. By minimizing the cross-entropy loss on the input prompt only, SLOT helps the model better aligned with and follow each given instruction. In experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms the compared models across multiple benchmarks and LLMs. For example, Qwen2.5-7B with SLOT achieves an accuracy gain of 8.6% on GSM8K from 57.54% to 66.19%, while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B with SLOT achieves a SOTA accuracy of 68.69% on GPQA among 70B-level models.

      <title>ViEEG: Hierarchical Neural Coding with Cross-Modal Progressive Enhancement for EEG-Based Visual Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and decoding brain activity into visual representations is a fundamental challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. While EEG-based visual decoding has shown promise due to its non-invasive, low-cost nature and millisecond-level temporal resolution, existing methods are limited by their reliance on flat neural representations that overlook the brain's inherent visual hierarchy. In this paper, we introduce ViEEG, a biologically inspired hierarchical EEG decoding framework that aligns with the Hubel-Wiesel theory of visual processing. ViEEG decomposes each visual stimulus into three biologically aligned components-contour, foreground object, and contextual scene-serving as anchors for a three-stream EEG encoder. These EEG features are progressively integrated via cross-attention routing, simulating cortical information flow from V1 to IT to the association cortex. We further adopt hierarchical contrastive learning to align EEG representations with CLIP embeddings, enabling zero-shot object recognition. Extensive experiments on the THINGS-EEG dataset demonstrate that ViEEG achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 40.9% Top-1 accuracy in subject-dependent and 22.9% Top-1 accuracy in cross-subject settings, surpassing existing methods by over 45%. Our framework not only advances the performance frontier but also sets a new paradigm for biologically grounded brain decoding in AI.</description>

      <title>Fractured Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inference-time scaling techniques have significantly bolstered the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by harnessing additional computational effort at inference without retraining. Similarly, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and its extension, Long CoT, improve accuracy by generating rich intermediate reasoning trajectories, but these approaches incur substantial token costs that impede their deployment in latency-sensitive settings. In this work, we first show that truncated CoT, which stops reasoning before completion and directly generates the final answer, often matches full CoT sampling while using dramatically fewer tokens. Building on this insight, we introduce Fractured Sampling, a unified inference-time strategy that interpolates between full CoT and solution-only sampling along three orthogonal axes: (1) the number of reasoning trajectories, (2) the number of final solutions per trajectory, and (3) the depth at which reasoning traces are truncated. Through extensive experiments on five diverse reasoning benchmarks and several model scales, we demonstrate that Fractured Sampling consistently achieves superior accuracy-cost trade-offs, yielding steep log-linear scaling gains in Pass@k versus token budget. Our analysis reveals how to allocate computation across these dimensions to maximize performance, paving the way for more efficient and scalable LLM reasoning.

      <title>KHRONOS: a Kernel-Based Neural Architecture for Rapid, Resource-Efficient Scientific Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contemporary models of high dimensional physical systems are constrained by the curse of dimensionality and a reliance on dense data. We introduce KHRONOS (Kernel Expansion Hierarchy for Reduced Order, Neural Optimized Surrogates), an AI framework for model based, model free and model inversion tasks. KHRONOS constructs continuously differentiable target fields with a hierarchical composition of per-dimension kernel expansions, which are tensorized into modes and then superposed. We evaluate KHRONOS on a canonical 2D, Poisson equation benchmark: across 16 to 512 degrees of freedom (DoFs), it obtained L_2-square errors of 5e-4 down to 6e-11. This represents a greater than 100-fold gain over Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (which itself reports a 100 times improvement on MLPs/PINNs with 100 times fewer parameters) when controlling for the number of parameters. This also represents a 1e6-fold improvement in L_2-square error compared to standard linear FEM at comparable DoFs. Inference complexity is dominated by inner products, yielding sub-millisecond full-field predictions that scale to an arbitrary resolution. For inverse problems, KHRONOS facilitates rapid, iterative level set recovery in only a few forward evaluations, with sub-microsecond per sample latency. KHRONOS's scalability, expressivity, and interpretability open new avenues in constrained edge computing, online control, computer vision, and beyond.</description>

      <title>R3: Robust Rubric-Agnostic Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning language model outputs with human preferences, yet existing approaches often lack both controllability and interpretability. These models are typically optimized for narrow objectives, limiting their generalizability to broader downstream tasks. Moreover, their scalar outputs are difficult to interpret without contextual reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce R3, a novel reward modeling framework that is rubric-agnostic, generalizable across evaluation dimensions, and provides interpretable, reasoned score assignments. R3 enables more transparent and flexible evaluation of language models, supporting robust alignment with diverse human values and use cases. Our models, data, and code are available as open source at https://github.com/rubricreward/r3</description>

      <title>Learning to Program Quantum Measurements for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have sparked significant interest, driving extensive exploration of quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to address a wide range of complex challenges. The development of high-performance QML models requires expert-level expertise, presenting a key challenge to the widespread adoption of QML. Critical obstacles include the design of effective data encoding strategies and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are vital for the performance of QML models. Furthermore, the measurement process is often neglected-most existing QML models employ predefined measurement schemes that may not align with the specific requirements of the targeted problem. We propose an innovative framework that renders the observable of a quantum system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-trainable. This approach employs an end-to-end differentiable learning framework, enabling simultaneous optimization of the neural network used to program the parameterized observables and the standard quantum circuit parameters. Notably, the quantum observable parameters are dynamically programmed by the neural network, allowing the observables to adapt in real time based on the input data stream. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method effectively programs observables dynamically within variational quantum circuits, achieving superior results compared to existing approaches. Notably, it delivers enhanced performance metrics, such as higher classification accuracy, thereby significantly improving the overall effectiveness of QML models.</description>

      <title>Improving Compositional Generation with Diffusion Models Using Lift Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel resampling criterion using lift scores, for improving compositional generation in diffusion models. By leveraging the lift scores, we evaluate whether generated samples align with each single condition and then compose the results to determine whether the composed prompt is satisfied. Our key insight is that lift scores can be efficiently approximated using only the original diffusion model, requiring no additional training or external modules. We develop an optimized variant that achieves relatively lower computational overhead during inference while maintaining effectiveness. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that lift scores significantly improved the condition alignment for compositional generation across 2D synthetic data, CLEVR position tasks, and text-to-image synthesis.

      <title>CLEVER: A Curated Benchmark for Formally Verified Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$, a high-quality, curated benchmark of 161 problems for end-to-end verified code generation in Lean. Each problem consists of (1) the task of generating a specification that matches a held-out ground-truth specification, and (2) the task of generating a Lean implementation that provably satisfies this specification. Unlike prior benchmarks, ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ avoids test-case supervision, LLM-generated annotations, and specifications that leak implementation logic or allow vacuous solutions. All outputs are verified post-hoc using Lean's type checker to ensure machine-checkable correctness. We use ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ to evaluate several few-shot and agentic approaches based on state-of-the-art language models. These methods all struggle to achieve full verification, establishing it as a challenging frontier benchmark for program synthesis and formal reasoning. Our benchmark can be found on GitHub(https://github.com/trishullab/clever) as well as HuggingFace(https://huggingface.co/datasets/amitayusht/clever). All our evaluation code is also available online(https://github.com/trishullab/clever-prover).</description>

      <title>Adaptive Cyclic Diffusion for Inference Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across domains ranging from image synthesis to complex reasoning tasks. However, most inference-time scaling methods rely on fixed denoising schedules, limiting their ability to allocate computation based on instance difficulty or task-specific demands adaptively. We introduce the challenge of adaptive inference-time scaling-dynamically adjusting computational effort during inference-and propose Adaptive Bi-directional Cyclic Diffusion (ABCD), a flexible, search-based inference framework. ABCD refines outputs through bi-directional diffusion cycles while adaptively controlling exploration depth and termination. It comprises three components: Cyclic Diffusion Search, Automatic Exploration-Exploitation Balancing, and Adaptive Thinking Time. Experiments show that ABCD improves performance across diverse tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Personalized Conversational Benchmark: Towards Simulating Personalized Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present PersonaConvBench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating personalized reasoning and generation in multi-turn conversations with large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing work that focuses on either personalization or conversational structure in isolation, PersonaConvBench integrates both, offering three core tasks: sentence classification, impact regression, and user-centric text generation across ten diverse Reddit-based domains. This design enables systematic analysis of how personalized conversational context shapes LLM outputs in realistic multi-user scenarios. We benchmark several commercial and open-source LLMs under a unified prompting setup and observe that incorporating personalized history yields substantial performance improvements, including a 198 percent relative gain over the best non-conversational baseline in sentiment classification. By releasing PersonaConvBench with evaluations and code, we aim to support research on LLMs that adapt to individual styles, track long-term context, and produce contextually rich, engaging responses.</description>

      <title>DiagnosisArena: Benchmarking Diagnostic Reasoning for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of groundbreaking large language models capable of performing complex reasoning tasks holds significant promise for addressing various scientific challenges, including those arising in complex clinical scenarios. To enable their safe and effective deployment in real-world healthcare settings, it is urgently necessary to benchmark the diagnostic capabilities of current models systematically. Given the limitations of existing medical benchmarks in evaluating advanced diagnostic reasoning, we present DiagnosisArena, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark designed to rigorously assess professional-level diagnostic competence. DiagnosisArena consists of 1,113 pairs of segmented patient cases and corresponding diagnoses, spanning 28 medical specialties, deriving from clinical case reports published in 10 top-tier medical journals. The benchmark is developed through a meticulous construction pipeline, involving multiple rounds of screening and review by both AI systems and human experts, with thorough checks conducted to prevent data leakage. Our study reveals that even the most advanced reasoning models, o3-mini, o1, and DeepSeek-R1, achieve only 45.82%, 31.09%, and 17.79% accuracy, respectively. This finding highlights a significant generalization bottleneck in current large language models when faced with clinical diagnostic reasoning challenges. Through DiagnosisArena, we aim to drive further advancements in AIs diagnostic reasoning capabilities, enabling more effective solutions for real-world clinical diagnostic challenges. We provide the benchmark and evaluation tools for further research and development https://github.com/SPIRAL-MED/DiagnosisArena.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis by LLM-Generated Rationales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been growing interest in Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) in recent years. Existing methods predominantly rely on pre-trained small language models (SLMs) to collect information related to aspects and sentiments from both image and text, with an aim to align these two modalities. However, small SLMs possess limited capacity and knowledge, often resulting in inaccurate identification of meaning, aspects, sentiments, and their interconnections in textual and visual data. On the other hand, Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in various tasks by effectively exploring fine-grained information in multimodal data. However, some studies indicate that LLMs still fall short compared to fine-tuned small models in the field of ABSA. Based on these findings, we propose a novel framework, termed LRSA, which combines the decision-making capabilities of SLMs with additional information provided by LLMs for MABSA. Specifically, we inject explanations generated by LLMs as rationales into SLMs and employ a dual cross-attention mechanism for enhancing feature interaction and fusion, thereby augmenting the SLMs' ability to identify aspects and sentiments. We evaluated our method using two baseline models, numerous experiments highlight the superiority of our approach on three widely-used benchmarks, indicating its generalizability and applicability to most pre-trained models for MABSA.</description>

      <title>Scaling Reasoning, Losing Control: Evaluating Instruction Following in Large Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruction-following is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with user intent. While recent reasoning-oriented models exhibit impressive performance on complex mathematical problems, their ability to adhere to natural language instructions remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce MathIF, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating instruction-following in mathematical reasoning tasks. Our empirical analysis reveals a consistent tension between scaling up reasoning capacity and maintaining controllability, as models that reason more effectively often struggle to comply with user directives. We find that models tuned on distilled long chains-of-thought or trained with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning often degrade in instruction adherence, especially when generation length increases. Furthermore, we show that even simple interventions can partially recover obedience, though at the cost of reasoning performance. These findings highlight a fundamental tension in current LLM training paradigms and motivate the need for more instruction-aware reasoning models. We release the code and data at https://github.com/TingchenFu/MathIF.</description>

      <title>Imitation Learning via Focused Satisficing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning often assumes that demonstrations are close to optimal according to some fixed, but unknown, cost function. However, according to satisficing theory, humans often choose acceptable behavior based on their personal (and potentially dynamic) levels of aspiration, rather than achieving (near-) optimality. For example, a lunar lander demonstration that successfully lands without crashing might be acceptable to a novice despite being slow or jerky. Using a margin-based objective to guide deep reinforcement learning, our focused satisficing approach to imitation learning seeks a policy that surpasses the demonstrator's aspiration levels -- defined over trajectories or portions of trajectories -- on unseen demonstrations without explicitly learning those aspirations. We show experimentally that this focuses the policy to imitate the highest quality (portions of) demonstrations better than existing imitation learning methods, providing much higher rates of guaranteed acceptability to the demonstrator, and competitive true returns on a range of environments.</description>

      <title>MAS-ZERO: Designing Multi-Agent Systems with Zero Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) leveraging the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant potential for tackling complex tasks. However, most current MAS depend on manually designed agent roles and communication protocols. These manual designs often fail to align with the underlying LLMs' strengths and struggle to adapt to novel tasks. Recent automatic MAS approaches attempt to mitigate these limitations but typically necessitate a validation set for tuning and yield static MAS designs lacking adaptability during inference. We introduce MAS-ZERO, the first self-evolved, inference-time framework for automatic MAS design. MAS-ZERO employs meta-level design to iteratively generate, evaluate, and refine MAS configurations tailored to each problem instance, without requiring a validation set. Critically, it enables dynamic agent composition and problem decomposition through meta-feedback on solvability and completeness. Experiments across math, graduate-level QA, and software engineering benchmarks, using both closed-source and open-source LLM backbones of varying sizes, demonstrate that MAS-ZERO outperforms both manual and automatic MAS baselines, achieving a 7.44% average accuracy improvement over the next strongest baseline while maintaining cost-efficiency. These findings underscore the promise of meta-level self-evolved design for creating effective and adaptive MAS.</description>

      <title>Self-GIVE: Associative Thinking from Limited Structured Knowledge for Enhanced Large Language Model Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When addressing complex questions that require new information, people often associate the question with existing knowledge to derive a sensible answer. For instance, when evaluating whether melatonin aids insomnia, one might associate "hormones helping mental disorders" with "melatonin being a hormone and insomnia a mental disorder" to complete the reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) also require such associative thinking, particularly in resolving scientific inquiries when retrieved knowledge is insufficient and does not directly answer the question. Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation (GIVE) addresses this by using a knowledge graph (KG) to extrapolate structured knowledge. However, it involves the construction and pruning of many hypothetical triplets, which limits efficiency and generalizability. We propose Self-GIVE, a retrieve-RL framework that enhances LLMs with automatic associative thinking through reinforcement learning. Self-GIVE extracts structured information and entity sets to assist the model in linking to the queried concepts. We address GIVE's key limitations: (1) extensive LLM calls and token overhead for knowledge extrapolation, (2) difficulty in deploying on smaller LLMs (3B or 7B) due to complex instructions, and (3) inaccurate knowledge from LLM pruning. Specifically, after fine-tuning using self-GIVE with a 135 node UMLS KG, it improves the performance of the Qwen2.5 3B and 7B models by up to $\textbf{28.5%$\rightarrow$71.4%}$ and $\textbf{78.6$\rightarrow$90.5%}$ in samples $\textbf{unseen}$ in challenging biomedical QA tasks. In particular, Self-GIVE allows the 7B model to match or outperform GPT3.5 turbo with GIVE, while cutting token usage by over 90\%. Self-GIVE enhances the scalable integration of structured retrieval and reasoning with associative thinking.</description>

      <title>ThinkRec: Thinking-based recommendation via LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled more semantic-aware recommendations through natural language generation. Existing LLM for recommendation (LLM4Rec) methods mostly operate in a System 1-like manner, relying on superficial features to match similar items based on click history, rather than reasoning through deeper behavioral logic. This often leads to superficial and erroneous recommendations. Motivated by this, we propose ThinkRec, a thinking-based framework that shifts LLM4Rec from System 1 to System 2 (rational system). Technically, ThinkRec introduces a thinking activation mechanism that augments item metadata with keyword summarization and injects synthetic reasoning traces, guiding the model to form interpretable reasoning chains that consist of analyzing interaction histories, identifying user preferences, and making decisions based on target items. On top of this, we propose an instance-wise expert fusion mechanism to reduce the reasoning difficulty. By dynamically assigning weights to expert models based on users' latent features, ThinkRec adapts its reasoning path to individual users, thereby enhancing precision and personalization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ThinkRec significantly improves the accuracy and interpretability of recommendations. Our implementations are available in anonymous Github: https://github.com/Yu-Qi-hang/ThinkRec.</description>

      <title>StepSearch: Igniting LLMs Search Ability via Step-Wise Proximal Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient multi-hop reasoning requires Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents to acquire high-value external knowledge iteratively. Previous work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to perform search-based document retrieval, achieving notable improvements in QA performance, but underperform on complex, multi-hop QA resulting from the sparse rewards from global signal only. To address this gap in existing research, we introduce StepSearch, a framework for search LLMs that trained with step-wise proximal policy optimization method. It consists of richer and more detailed intermediate search rewards and token-level process supervision based on information gain and redundancy penalties to better guide each search step. We constructed a fine-grained question-answering dataset containing sub-question-level search trajectories based on open source datasets through a set of data pipeline method. On standard multi-hop QA benchmarks, it significantly outperforms global-reward baselines, achieving 11.2% and 4.2% absolute improvements for 3B and 7B models over various search with RL baselines using only 19k training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-grained, stepwise supervision in optimizing deep search LLMs. Our code will be released on https://github.com/Zillwang/StepSearch.</description>

      <title>Your Language Model Can Secretly Write Like Humans: Contrastive Paraphrase Attacks on LLM-Generated Text Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The misuse of large language models (LLMs), such as academic plagiarism, has driven the development of detectors to identify LLM-generated texts. To bypass these detectors, paraphrase attacks have emerged to purposely rewrite these texts to evade detection. Despite the success, existing methods require substantial data and computational budgets to train a specialized paraphraser, and their attack efficacy greatly reduces when faced with advanced detection algorithms. To address this, we propose \textbf{Co}ntrastive \textbf{P}araphrase \textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that effectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is to carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like texts. Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can still result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes that can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an auxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like distribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns from the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to produce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors. Our theoretical analysis suggests the superiority of the proposed attack. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CoPA in fooling text detectors across various scenarios.</description>

      <title>VerifyBench: Benchmarking Reference-based Reward Systems for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large reasoning models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved remarkable performance in the domain of reasoning. A key component of their training is the incorporation of verifiable rewards within reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing reward benchmarks do not evaluate reference-based reward systems, leaving researchers with limited understanding of the accuracy of verifiers used in RL. In this paper, we introduce two benchmarks, VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, designed to assess the performance of reference-based reward systems. These benchmarks are constructed through meticulous data collection and curation, followed by careful human annotation to ensure high quality. Current models still show considerable room for improvement on both VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, especially smaller-scale models. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough and comprehensive analysis of evaluation results, offering insights for understanding and developing reference-based reward systems. Our proposed benchmarks serve as effective tools for guiding the development of verifier accuracy and the reasoning capabilities of models trained via RL in reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>VERDI: VLM-Embedded Reasoning for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While autonomous driving (AD) stacks struggle with decision making under partial observability and real-world complexity, human drivers are capable of commonsense reasoning to make near-optimal decisions with limited information. Recent work has attempted to leverage finetuned Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for trajectory planning at inference time to emulate human behavior. Despite their success in benchmark evaluations, these methods are often impractical to deploy (a 70B parameter VLM inference at merely 8 tokens per second requires more than 160G of memory), and their monolithic network structure prohibits safety decomposition. To bridge this gap, we propose VLM-Embedded Reasoning for autonomous Driving (VERDI), a training-time framework that distills the reasoning process and commonsense knowledge of VLMs into the AD stack. VERDI augments modular differentiable end-to-end (e2e) AD models by aligning intermediate module outputs at the perception, prediction, and planning stages with text features explaining the driving reasoning process produced by VLMs. By encouraging alignment in latent space, VERDI enables the modular AD stack to internalize structured reasoning, without incurring the inference-time costs of large VLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the NuScenes dataset and find that VERDI outperforms existing e2e methods that do not embed reasoning by 10% in $\ell_{2}$ distance, while maintaining high inference speed.</description>

      <title>MoRE-Brain: Routed Mixture of Experts for Interpretable and Generalizable Cross-Subject fMRI Visual Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoding visual experiences from fMRI offers a powerful avenue to understand human perception and develop advanced brain-computer interfaces. However, current progress often prioritizes maximizing reconstruction fidelity while overlooking interpretability, an essential aspect for deriving neuroscientific insight. To address this gap, we propose MoRE-Brain, a neuro-inspired framework designed for high-fidelity, adaptable, and interpretable visual reconstruction. MoRE-Brain uniquely employs a hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts architecture where distinct experts process fMRI signals from functionally related voxel groups, mimicking specialized brain networks. The experts are first trained to encode fMRI into the frozen CLIP space. A finetuned diffusion model then synthesizes images, guided by expert outputs through a novel dual-stage routing mechanism that dynamically weighs expert contributions across the diffusion process. MoRE-Brain offers three main advancements: First, it introduces a novel Mixture-of-Experts architecture grounded in brain network principles for neuro-decoding. Second, it achieves efficient cross-subject generalization by sharing core expert networks while adapting only subject-specific routers. Third, it provides enhanced mechanistic insight, as the explicit routing reveals precisely how different modeled brain regions shape the semantic and spatial attributes of the reconstructed image. Extensive experiments validate MoRE-Brain's high reconstruction fidelity, with bottleneck analyses further demonstrating its effective utilization of fMRI signals, distinguishing genuine neural decoding from over-reliance on generative priors. Consequently, MoRE-Brain marks a substantial advance towards more generalizable and interpretable fMRI-based visual decoding. Code will be publicly available soon: https://github.com/yuxiangwei0808/MoRE-Brain.</description>

      <title>Pixel Reasoner: Incentivizing Pixel-Space Reasoning with Curiosity-Driven Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning has significantly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains. However, this reasoning process has been confined exclusively to textual space, limiting its effectiveness in visually intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of reasoning in the pixel-space. Within this novel framework, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are equipped with a suite of visual reasoning operations, such as zoom-in and select-frame. These operations enable VLMs to directly inspect, interrogate, and infer from visual evidences, thereby enhancing reasoning fidelity for visual tasks. Cultivating such pixel-space reasoning capabilities in VLMs presents notable challenges, including the model's initially imbalanced competence and its reluctance to adopt the newly introduced pixel-space operations. We address these challenges through a two-phase training approach. The first phase employs instruction tuning on synthesized reasoning traces to familiarize the model with the novel visual operations. Following this, a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leverages a curiosity-driven reward scheme to balance exploration between pixel-space reasoning and textual reasoning. With these visual operations, VLMs can interact with complex visual inputs, such as information-rich images or videos to proactively gather necessary information. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves VLM performance across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks. Our 7B model, \model, achieves 84\% on V* bench, 74\% on TallyQA-Complex, and 84\% on InfographicsVQA, marking the highest accuracy achieved by any open-source model to date. These results highlight the importance of pixel-space reasoning and the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Online Data to Enhance Medical Knowledge in a Small Persian Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of language models has demonstrated the potential of artificial intelligence in the healthcare industry. However, small language models struggle with specialized domains in low-resource languages like Persian. While numerous medical-domain websites exist in Persian, no curated dataset or corpus has been available making ours the first of its kind. This study explores the enhancement of medical knowledge in a small language model by leveraging accessible online data, including a crawled corpus from medical magazines and a dataset of real doctor-patient QA pairs. We fine-tuned a baseline model using our curated data to improve its medical knowledge. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that the fine-tuned model achieves improved accuracy in medical question answering and provides better responses compared to its baseline. This work highlights the potential of leveraging open-access online data to enrich small language models in medical fields, providing a novel solution for Persian medical AI applications suitable for resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Date Fragments: A Hidden Bottleneck of Tokenization for Temporal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern BPE tokenizers often split calendar dates into meaningless fragments, e.g., 20250312 $\rightarrow$ 202, 503, 12, inflating token counts and obscuring the inherent structure needed for robust temporal reasoning. In this work, we (1) introduce a simple yet interpretable metric, termed date fragmentation ratio, that measures how faithfully a tokenizer preserves multi-digit date components; (2) release DateAugBench, a suite of 6500 examples spanning three temporal reasoning tasks: context-based date resolution, format-invariance puzzles, and date arithmetic across historical, contemporary, and future time periods; and (3) through layer-wise probing and causal attention-hop analyses, uncover an emergent date-abstraction mechanism whereby large language models stitch together the fragments of month, day, and year components for temporal reasoning. Our experiments show that excessive fragmentation correlates with accuracy drops of up to 10 points on uncommon dates like historical and futuristic dates. Further, we find that the larger the model, the faster the emergent date abstraction that heals date fragments is accomplished. Lastly, we observe a reasoning path that LLMs follow to assemble date fragments, typically differing from human interpretation (year $\rightarrow$ month $\rightarrow$ day). Our datasets and code are made publicly available \href{https://github.com/gagan3012/date-fragments}{here}.</description>

      <title>Understanding Generative AI Capabilities in Everyday Image Editing Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) holds significant promise for automating everyday image editing tasks, especially following the recent release of GPT-4o on March 25, 2025. However, what subjects do people most often want edited? What kinds of editing actions do they want to perform (e.g., removing or stylizing the subject)? Do people prefer precise edits with predictable outcomes or highly creative ones? By understanding the characteristics of real-world requests and the corresponding edits made by freelance photo-editing wizards, can we draw lessons for improving AI-based editors and determine which types of requests can currently be handled successfully by AI editors? In this paper, we present a unique study addressing these questions by analyzing 83k requests from the past 12 years (2013-2025) on the Reddit community, which collected 305k PSR-wizard edits. According to human ratings, approximately only 33% of requests can be fulfilled by the best AI editors (including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-Flash, SeedEdit). Interestingly, AI editors perform worse on low-creativity requests that require precise editing than on more open-ended tasks. They often struggle to preserve the identity of people and animals, and frequently make non-requested touch-ups. On the other side of the table, VLM judges (e.g., o1) perform differently from human judges and may prefer AI edits more than human edits.

      <title>Dysfluent WFST: A Framework for Zero-Shot Speech Dysfluency Transcription and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic detection of speech dysfluency aids speech-language pathologists in efficient transcription of disordered speech, enhancing diagnostics and treatment planning. Traditional methods, often limited to classification, provide insufficient clinical insight, and text-independent models misclassify dysfluency, especially in context-dependent cases. This work introduces Dysfluent-WFST, a zero-shot decoder that simultaneously transcribes phonemes and detects dysfluency. Unlike previous models, Dysfluent-WFST operates with upstream encoders like WavLM and requires no additional training. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in both phonetic error rate and dysfluency detection on simulated and real speech data. Our approach is lightweight, interpretable, and effective, demonstrating that explicit modeling of pronunciation behavior in decoding, rather than complex architectures, is key to improving dysfluency processing systems.</description>

      <title>Are the Hidden States Hiding Something? Testing the Limits of Factuality-Encoding Capabilities in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Factual hallucinations are a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). They undermine reliability and user trust by generating inaccurate or fabricated content. Recent studies suggest that when generating false statements, the internal states of LLMs encode information about truthfulness. However, these studies often rely on synthetic datasets that lack realism, which limits generalization when evaluating the factual accuracy of text generated by the model itself. In this paper, we challenge the findings of previous work by investigating truthfulness encoding capabilities, leading to the generation of a more realistic and challenging dataset. Specifically, we extend previous work by introducing: (1) a strategy for sampling plausible true-false factoid sentences from tabular data and (2) a procedure for generating realistic, LLM-dependent true-false datasets from Question Answering collections. Our analysis of two open-source LLMs reveals that while the findings from previous studies are partially validated, generalization to LLM-generated datasets remains challenging. This study lays the groundwork for future research on factuality in LLMs and offers practical guidelines for more effective evaluation.</description>

      <title>Auto-nnU-Net: Towards Automated Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) includes diverse tasks, from bone to organ segmentation, each with its own challenges in finding the best segmentation model. The state-of-the-art AutoML-related MIS-framework nnU-Net automates many aspects of model configuration but remains constrained by fixed hyperparameters and heuristic design choices. As a full-AutoML framework for MIS, we propose Auto-nnU-Net, a novel nnU-Net variant enabling hyperparameter optimization (HPO), neural architecture search (NAS), and hierarchical NAS (HNAS). Additionally, we propose Regularized PriorBand to balance model accuracy with the computational resources required for training, addressing the resource constraints often faced in real-world medical settings that limit the feasibility of extensive training procedures. We evaluate our approach across diverse MIS datasets from the well-established Medical Segmentation Decathlon, analyzing the impact of AutoML techniques on segmentation performance, computational efficiency, and model design choices. The results demonstrate that our AutoML approach substantially improves the segmentation performance of nnU-Net on 6 out of 10 datasets and is on par on the other datasets while maintaining practical resource requirements.

      <title>O$^2$-Searcher: A Searching-based Agent Model for Open-Domain Open-Ended Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advancements, are fundamentally limited by their static parametric knowledge, hindering performance on tasks requiring open-domain up-to-date information. While enabling LLMs to interact with external knowledge environments is a promising solution, current efforts primarily address closed-end problems. Open-ended questions, which characterized by lacking a standard answer or providing non-unique and diverse answers, remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present O$^2$-Searcher, a novel search agent leveraging reinforcement learning to effectively tackle both open-ended and closed-ended questions in the open domain. O$^2$-Searcher leverages an efficient, locally simulated search environment for dynamic knowledge acquisition, effectively decoupling the external world knowledge from model's sophisticated reasoning processes. It employs a unified training mechanism with meticulously designed reward functions, enabling the agent to identify problem types and adapt different answer generation strategies. Furthermore, to evaluate performance on complex open-ended tasks, we construct O$^2$-QA, a high-quality benchmark featuring 300 manually curated, multi-domain open-ended questions with associated web page caches. Extensive experiments show that O$^2$-Searcher, using only a 3B model, significantly surpasses leading LLM agents on O$^2$-QA. It also achieves SOTA results on various closed-ended QA benchmarks against similarly-sized models, while performing on par with much larger ones.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Framework for Predicting the Remaining Useful Life of Lithium-Ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is essential for enabling timely maintenance of lithium-ion batteries, impacting the operational efficiency of electric applications that rely on them. This paper proposes a RUL prediction approach that leverages data from recent charge-discharge cycles to estimate the number of remaining usable cycles. The approach introduces both a novel signal processing pipeline and a deep learning prediction model. In the signal preprocessing pipeline, a derived capacity feature $\dot{Q}(I, Q)$ is computed based on current and capacity signals. Alongside original capacity, voltage and current, these features are denoised and enhanced using statistical metrics and a delta-based method to capture differences between the current and previous cycles. In the prediction model, the processed features are then fed into a hybrid deep learning architecture composed of 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Attentional Long Short-Term Memory (A-LSTM), and Ordinary Differential Equation-based LSTM (ODE-LSTM) blocks. This architecture is designed to capture both local signal characteristics and long-range temporal dependencies while modeling the continuous-time dynamics of battery degradation. The model is further evaluated using transfer learning across different learning strategies and target data partitioning scenarios. Results indicate that the model maintains robust performance, even when fine-tuned on limited target data. Experimental results on two publicly available large-scale datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms a baseline deep learning approach and machine learning techniques, achieving an RMSE of 101.59, highlighting its strong potential for real-world RUL prediction applications.</description>

      <title>Action is All You Need: Dual-Flow Generative Ranking Network for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Dual-Flow Generative Ranking Network (DFGR) for recommendation scenarios. This architecture utilizes only raw user behavior sequence information together with a small amount of basic information describing the behaviors to address the limitations of Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) that rely on extensive manual feature engineering. DFGR employs a dual-flow mechanism to optimize interaction modeling, ensuring efficient training and inference through end-to-end token processing. It duplicates the original user behavior sequence into a real flow and a fake flow based on whether the action information used is authentic and then defines a novel interaction method between the real flow and the fake flow within the QKV module of the self-attention mechanism. This design reduces computational overhead and improves both training efficiency and inference performance compared to Meta's HSTU-based model which can be considered the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) model in generative ranking. Our experiments in open-source and real industrial datasets show that DFGR outperforms DLRM, which can be regarded as an industrial online baseline that uses extensive feature engineering, Meta's HSTU approaches, and common recommendation architectures such as DIN, DCN, DIEN, and DeepFM. We also investigate optimal parameter allocation strategies under computational constraints, establishing DFGR as an efficient and effective next-generation generative ranking paradigm.</description>

      <title>Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</description>

      <title>SimpleDeepSearcher: Deep Information Seeking via Web-Powered Reasoning Trajectory Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have advanced large language models (LLMs) in complex deep search scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning and iterative information retrieval. However, existing approaches face critical limitations that lack high-quality training trajectories or suffer from the distributional mismatches in simulated environments and prohibitive computational costs for real-world deployment. This paper introduces SimpleDeepSearcher, a lightweight yet effective framework that bridges this gap through strategic data engineering rather than complex training paradigms. Our approach synthesizes high-quality training data by simulating realistic user interactions in live web search environments, coupled with a multi-criteria curation strategy that optimizes the diversity and quality of input and output side. Experiments on five benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate that SFT on only 871 curated samples yields significant improvements over RL-based baselines. Our work establishes SFT as a viable pathway by systematically addressing the data-scarce bottleneck, offering practical insights for efficient deep search systems.

      <title>CASS: Nvidia to AMD Transpilation with Data, Models, and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce CASS, the first large-scale dataset and model suite for cross-architecture GPU code transpilation, targeting both source-level (CUDA $\leftrightarrow$ HIP) and assembly-level (Nvidia SASS $\leftrightarrow$ AMD RDNA3) translation. The dataset comprises 70k verified code pairs across host and device, addressing a critical gap in low-level GPU code portability. Leveraging this resource, we train the CASS family of domain-specific language models, achieving 95% source translation accuracy and 37.5% assembly translation accuracy, substantially outperforming commercial baselines such as GPT-4o, Claude, and Hipify. Our generated code matches native performance in over 85% of test cases, preserving runtime and memory behavior. To support rigorous evaluation, we introduce CASS-Bench, a curated benchmark spanning 16 GPU domains with ground-truth execution. All data, models, and evaluation tools are released as open source to foster progress in GPU compiler tooling, binary compatibility, and LLM-guided hardware translation. Dataset and benchmark are on \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBZUAI/cass}{\textcolor{blue}{HuggingFace}}, with code at \href{https://github.com/GustavoStahl/CASS}{\textcolor{blue}{GitHub}}.</description>

      <title>Unveil Multi-Picture Descriptions for Multilingual Mild Cognitive Impairment Detection via Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment from picture descriptions is critical yet challenging, especially in multilingual and multiple picture settings. Prior work has primarily focused on English speakers describing a single picture (e.g., the 'Cookie Theft'). The TAUKDIAL-2024 challenge expands this scope by introducing multilingual speakers and multiple pictures, which presents new challenges in analyzing picture-dependent content. To address these challenges, we propose a framework with three components: (1) enhancing discriminative representation learning via supervised contrastive learning, (2) involving image modality rather than relying solely on speech and text modalities, and (3) applying a Product of Experts (PoE) strategy to mitigate spurious correlations and overfitting. Our framework improves MCI detection performance, achieving a +7.1% increase in Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) (from 68.1% to 75.2%) and a +2.9% increase in F1 score (from 80.6% to 83.5%) compared to the text unimodal baseline. Notably, the contrastive learning component yields greater gains for the text modality compared to speech. These results highlight our framework's effectiveness in multilingual and multi-picture MCI detection.</description>

      <title>RAP: Runtime-Adaptive Pruning for LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding and generation, but their enormous computational and memory requirements hinder deployment. Compression offers a potential solution to mitigate these constraints. However, most existing methods rely on fixed heuristics and thus fail to adapt to runtime memory variations or heterogeneous KV-cache demands arising from diverse user requests. To address these limitations, we propose RAP, an elastic pruning framework driven by reinforcement learning (RL) that dynamically adjusts compression strategies in a runtime-aware manner. Specifically, RAP dynamically tracks the evolving ratio between model parameters and KV-cache across practical execution. Recognizing that FFNs house most parameters, whereas parameter -light attention layers dominate KV-cache formation, the RL agent retains only those components that maximize utility within the current memory budget, conditioned on instantaneous workload and device state. Extensive experiments results demonstrate that RAP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, marking the first time to jointly consider model weights and KV-cache on the fly.</description>

      <title>A Fully Generative Motivational Interviewing Counsellor Chatbot for Moving Smokers Towards the Decision to Quit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conversational capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest that they may be able to perform as automated talk therapists. It is crucial to know if these systems would be effective and adhere to known standards. We present a counsellor chatbot that focuses on motivating tobacco smokers to quit smoking. It uses a state-of-the-art LLM and a widely applied therapeutic approach called Motivational Interviewing (MI), and was evolved in collaboration with clinician-scientists with expertise in MI. We also describe and validate an automated assessment of both the chatbot's adherence to MI and client responses. The chatbot was tested on 106 participants, and their confidence that they could succeed in quitting smoking was measured before the conversation and one week later. Participants' confidence increased by an average of 1.7 on a 0-10 scale. The automated assessment of the chatbot showed adherence to MI standards in 98% of utterances, higher than human counsellors. The chatbot scored well on a participant-reported metric of perceived empathy but lower than typical human counsellors. Furthermore, participants' language indicated a good level of motivation to change, a key goal in MI. These results suggest that the automation of talk therapy with a modern LLM has promise.</description>

      <title>EVM-Fusion: An Explainable Vision Mamba Architecture with Neural Algorithmic Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical image classification is critical for clinical decision-making, yet demands for accuracy, interpretability, and generalizability remain challenging. This paper introduces EVM-Fusion, an Explainable Vision Mamba architecture featuring a novel Neural Algorithmic Fusion (NAF) mechanism for multi-organ medical image classification. EVM-Fusion leverages a multipath design, where DenseNet and U-Net based pathways, enhanced by Vision Mamba (Vim) modules, operate in parallel with a traditional feature pathway. These diverse features are dynamically integrated via a two-stage fusion process: cross-modal attention followed by the iterative NAF block, which learns an adaptive fusion algorithm. Intrinsic explainability is embedded through path-specific spatial attention, Vim {\Delta}-value maps, traditional feature SE-attention, and cross-modal attention weights. Experiments on a diverse 9-class multi-organ medical image dataset demonstrate EVM-Fusion's strong classification performance, achieving 99.75% test accuracy and provide multi-faceted insights into its decision-making process, highlighting its potential for trustworthy AI in medical diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Discovering Forbidden Topics in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Refusal discovery is the task of identifying the full set of topics that a language model refuses to discuss. We introduce this new problem setting and develop a refusal discovery method, LLM-crawler, that uses token prefilling to find forbidden topics. We benchmark the LLM-crawler on Tulu-3-8B, an open-source model with public safety tuning data. Our crawler manages to retrieve 31 out of 36 topics within a budget of 1000 prompts. Next, we scale the crawl to a frontier model using the prefilling option of Claude-Haiku. Finally, we crawl three widely used open-weight models: Llama-3.3-70B and two of its variants finetuned for reasoning: DeepSeek-R1-70B and Perplexity-R1-1776-70B. DeepSeek-R1-70B reveals patterns consistent with censorship tuning: The model exhibits "thought suppression" behavior that indicates memorization of CCP-aligned responses. Although Perplexity-R1-1776-70B is robust to censorship, LLM-crawler elicits CCP-aligned refusals answers in the quantized model. Our findings highlight the critical need for refusal discovery methods to detect biases, boundaries, and alignment failures of AI systems.</description>

      <title>DTRT: Enhancing Human Intent Estimation and Role Allocation for Physical Human-Robot Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In physical Human-Robot Collaboration (pHRC), accurate human intent estimation and rational human-robot role allocation are crucial for safe and efficient assistance. Existing methods that rely on short-term motion data for intention estimation lack multi-step prediction capabilities, hindering their ability to sense intent changes and adjust human-robot assignments autonomously, resulting in potential discrepancies. To address these issues, we propose a Dual Transformer-based Robot Trajectron (DTRT) featuring a hierarchical architecture, which harnesses human-guided motion and force data to rapidly capture human intent changes, enabling accurate trajectory predictions and dynamic robot behavior adjustments for effective collaboration. Specifically, human intent estimation in DTRT uses two Transformer-based Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs), incorporating robot motion data in obstacle-free case with human-guided trajectory and force for obstacle avoidance. Additionally, Differential Cooperative Game Theory (DCGT) is employed to synthesize predictions based on human-applied forces, ensuring robot behavior align with human intention. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, DTRT incorporates human dynamics into long-term prediction, providing an accurate understanding of intention and enabling rational role allocation, achieving robot autonomy and maneuverability. Experiments demonstrate DTRT's accurate intent estimation and superior collaboration performance.</description>

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a key approach in achieving artificial general intelligence. In particular, vision-language MLLMs have been developed to generate not only text but also visual outputs from multimodal inputs. This advancement requires efficient image tokens that LLMs can process effectively both in input and output. However, existing image tokenization methods for MLLMs typically capture only global abstract concepts or uniformly segmented image patches, restricting MLLMs' capability to effectively understand or generate detailed visual content, particularly at the object level. To address this limitation, we propose an object-centric visual tokenizer based on Slot Attention specifically for MLLMs. In particular, based on the Q-Former encoder, diffusion decoder, and residual vector quantization, our proposed discretized slot tokens can encode local visual details while maintaining high-level semantics, and also align with textual data to be integrated seamlessly within a unified next-token prediction framework of LLMs. The resulting Slot-MLLM demonstrates significant performance improvements over baselines with previous visual tokenizers across various vision-language tasks that entail local detailed comprehension and generation. Notably, this work is the first demonstration of the feasibility of object-centric slot attention performed with MLLMs and in-the-wild natural images.</description>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has boosted math and coding in large language models, yet there has been little effort to extend RLVR into messier, real-world domains like forecasting. One sticking point is that outcome-based reinforcement learning for forecasting must learn from binary, delayed, and noisy rewards, a regime where standard fine-tuning is brittle. We show that outcome-only online RL on a 14B model can match frontier-scale accuracy and surpass it in calibration and hypothetical prediction market betting by adapting two leading algorithms, Group-Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) and ReMax, to the forecasting setting. Our adaptations remove per-question variance scaling in GRPO, apply baseline-subtracted advantages in ReMax, hydrate training with 100k temporally consistent synthetic questions, and introduce lightweight guard-rails that penalise gibberish, non-English responses and missing rationales, enabling a single stable pass over 110k events. Scaling ReMax to 110k questions and ensembling seven predictions yields a 14B model that matches frontier baseline o1 on accuracy on our holdout set (Brier = 0.193, p = 0.23) while beating it in calibration (ECE = 0.042, p &lt; 0.001). A simple trading rule turns this calibration edge into \$127 of hypothetical profit versus \$92 for o1 (p = 0.037). This demonstrates that refined RLVR methods can convert small-scale LLMs into potentially economically valuable forecasting tools, with implications for scaling this to larger models.</description>
