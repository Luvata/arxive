      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malware classification in dynamic environments presents a significant challenge due to concept drift, where the statistical properties of malware data evolve over time, complicating detection efforts. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning framework enhanced with a genetic algorithm to improve malware classification accuracy and adaptability. Our approach incorporates mutation operations and fitness score evaluations within genetic algorithms to continuously refine the deep learning model, ensuring robustness against evolving malware threats. Experimental results demonstrate that this hybrid method significantly enhances classification performance and adaptability, outperforming traditional static models. Our proposed approach offers a promising solution for real-time malware classification in ever-changing cybersecurity landscapes.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models: Assessing Logical and Arithmetic Errors across Wide Numerical Ranges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) is often evaluated using benchmarks with limited numerical ranges, failing to reflect real-world problem-solving across diverse scales. Furthermore, most existing evaluation methods only compare model outputs to ground-truth answers, obscuring insights into reasoning processes. To address these limitations, we introduce GSM-Ranges, a dataset generator derived from GSM8K that systematically perturbs numerical values in math problems to assess model robustness across varying numerical scales. Additionally, we propose a novel grading methodology that distinguishes between logical and non-logical errors, offering a more precise evaluation of reasoning processes beyond computational accuracy. Our experiments with various models reveal a significant increase in logical error rates-up to 14 percentage points-as numerical complexity rises, demonstrating a general weakness in reasoning with out-of-distribution numerical values. Moreover, while models demonstrate high accuracy on standalone arithmetic tasks, their performance deteriorates substantially when computations are embedded within word problems. These findings provide a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities and inform future research directions for improving numerical generalization in language models.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Pre-trained Embeddings in Binary Code Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has enabled remarkable progress in binary code analysis. In particular, pre-trained embeddings of assembly code have become a gold standard for solving analysis tasks, such as measuring code similarity or recognizing functions. These embeddings are capable of learning a vector representation from unlabeled code. In contrast to natural language processing, however, label information is not scarce for many tasks in binary code analysis. For example, labeled training data for function boundaries, optimization levels, and argument types can be easily derived from debug information provided by a compiler. Consequently, the main motivation of embeddings does not transfer directly to binary code analysis.
  In this paper, we explore the role of pre-trained embeddings from a critical perspective. To this end, we systematically evaluate recent embeddings for assembly code on five downstream tasks using a corpus of 1.2 million functions from the Debian distribution. We observe that several embeddings perform similarly when sufficient labeled data is available, and that differences reported in prior work are hardly noticeable. Surprisingly, we find that end-to-end learning without pre-training performs best on average, which calls into question the need for specialized embeddings. By varying the amount of labeled data, we eventually derive guidelines for when embeddings offer advantages and when end-to-end learning is preferable for binary code analysis.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning approach for parametrized and time dependent Partial Differential Equations using Dimensionality Reduction and Neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are central to science and engineering. Since solving them is computationally expensive, a lot of effort has been put into approximating their solution operator via both traditional and recently increasingly Deep Learning (DL) techniques. A conclusive methodology capable of accounting both for (continuous) time and parameter dependency in such DL models however is still lacking. In this paper, we propose an autoregressive and data-driven method using the analogy with classical numerical solvers for time-dependent, parametric and (typically) nonlinear PDEs. We present how Dimensionality Reduction (DR) can be coupled with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) in order to learn the solution operator of arbitrary PDEs. The idea of our work is that it is possible to map the high-fidelity (i.e., high-dimensional) PDE solution space into a reduced (low-dimensional) space, which subsequently exhibits dynamics governed by a (latent) Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). Solving this (easier) ODE in the reduced space allows avoiding solving the PDE in the high-dimensional solution space, thus decreasing the computational burden for repeated calculations for e.g., uncertainty quantification or design optimization purposes. The main outcome of this work is the importance of exploiting DR as opposed to the recent trend of building large and complex architectures: we show that by leveraging DR we can deliver not only more accurate predictions, but also a considerably lighter and faster DL model compared to existing methodologies.</description>

      <title>Self-Evaluation for Job-Shop Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems, such as scheduling and route planning, are crucial in various industries but are computationally intractable due to their NP-hard nature. Neural Combinatorial Optimization methods leverage machine learning to address these challenges but often depend on sequential decision-making, which is prone to error accumulation as small mistakes propagate throughout the process. Inspired by self-evaluation techniques in Large Language Models, we propose a novel framework that generates and evaluates subsets of assignments, moving beyond traditional stepwise approaches. Applied to the Job-Shop Scheduling Problem, our method integrates a heterogeneous graph neural network with a Transformer to build a policy model and a self-evaluation function. Experimental validation on challenging, well-known benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Beyond Models! Explainable Data Valuation and Metric Adaption for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User behavior records serve as the foundation for recommender systems. While the behavior data exhibits ease of acquisition, it often suffers from varying quality. Current methods employ data valuation to discern high-quality data from low-quality data. However, they tend to employ black-box design, lacking transparency and interpretability. Besides, they are typically tailored to specific evaluation metrics, leading to limited generality across various tasks. To overcome these issues, we propose an explainable and versatile framework DVR which can enhance the efficiency of data utilization tailored to any requirements of the model architectures and evaluation metrics. For explainable data valuation, a data valuator is presented to evaluate the data quality via calculating its Shapley value from the game-theoretic perspective, ensuring robust mathematical properties and reliability. In order to accommodate various evaluation metrics, including differentiable and non-differentiable ones, a metric adapter is devised based on reinforcement learning, where a metric is treated as the reinforcement reward that guides model optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmarks verify that our framework can improve the performance of current recommendation algorithms on various metrics including ranking accuracy, diversity, and fairness. Specifically, our framework achieves up to 34.7\% improvements over existing methods in terms of representative NDCG metric. The code is available at https://github.com/renqii/DVR.</description>

      <title>EEG Artifact Detection and Correction with Deep Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EEG signals convey important information about brain activity both in healthy and pathological conditions. However, they are inherently noisy, which poses significant challenges for accurate analysis and interpretation. Traditional EEG artifact removal methods, while effective, often require extensive expert intervention. This study presents LSTEEG, a novel LSTM-based autoencoder designed for the detection and correction of artifacts in EEG signals. Leveraging deep learning, particularly LSTM layers, LSTEEG captures non-linear dependencies in sequential EEG data. LSTEEG demonstrates superior performance in both artifact detection and correction tasks compared to other state-of-the-art convolutional autoencoders. Our methodology enhances the interpretability and utility of the autoencoder's latent space, enabling data-driven automated artefact removal in EEG its application in downstream tasks. This research advances the field of efficient and accurate multi-channel EEG preprocessing, and promotes the implementation and usage of automated EEG analysis pipelines for brain health applications.</description>

      <title>Skrr: Skip and Re-use Text Encoder Layers for Memory Efficient Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale text encoders in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performance in generating high-quality images from textual prompts. Unlike denoising modules that rely on multiple iterative steps, text encoders require only a single forward pass to produce text embeddings. However, despite their minimal contribution to total inference time and floating-point operations (FLOPs), text encoders demand significantly higher memory usage, up to eight times more than denoising modules. To address this inefficiency, we propose Skip and Re-use layers (Skrr), a simple yet effective pruning strategy specifically designed for text encoders in T2I diffusion models. Skrr exploits the inherent redundancy in transformer blocks by selectively skipping or reusing certain layers in a manner tailored for T2I tasks, thereby reducing memory consumption without compromising performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skrr maintains image quality comparable to the original model even under high sparsity levels, outperforming existing blockwise pruning methods. Furthermore, Skrr achieves state-of-the-art memory efficiency while preserving performance across multiple evaluation metrics, including the FID, CLIP, DreamSim, and GenEval scores.</description>

      <title>Efficient Split Learning LSTM Models for FPGA-based Edge IoT Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Split Learning (SL) recently emerged as an efficient paradigm for distributed Machine Learning (ML) suitable for the Internet Of Things (IoT)-Cloud systems. However, deploying SL on resource-constrained edge IoT platforms poses a significant challenge in terms of balancing the model performance against the processing, memory, and energy resources. In this work, we present a practical study of deploying SL framework on a real-world Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based edge IoT platform. We address the SL framework applied to a time-series processing model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Set in the context of river water quality monitoring and using real-world data, we train, optimize, and deploy a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model on a given edge IoT FPGA platform in different SL configurations. Our results demonstrate the importance of aligning design choices with specific application requirements, whether it is maximizing speed, minimizing power, or optimizing for resource constraints.</description>

      <title>Scalable Discrete Diffusion Samplers: Combinatorial Optimization and Statistical Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning to sample from complex unnormalized distributions over discrete domains emerged as a promising research direction with applications in statistical physics, variational inference, and combinatorial optimization. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in this domain. However, existing methods face limitations in memory scaling and thus the number of attainable diffusion steps since they require backpropagation through the entire generative process. To overcome these limitations we introduce two novel training methods for discrete diffusion samplers, one grounded in the policy gradient theorem and the other one leveraging Self-Normalized Neural Importance Sampling (SN-NIS). These methods yield memory-efficient training and achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised combinatorial optimization. Numerous scientific applications additionally require the ability of unbiased sampling. We introduce adaptations of SN-NIS and Neural Markov Chain Monte Carlo that enable for the first time the application of discrete diffusion models to this problem. We validate our methods on Ising model benchmarks and find that they outperform popular autoregressive approaches. Our work opens new avenues for applying diffusion models to a wide range of scientific applications in discrete domains that were hitherto restricted to exact likelihood models.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Algorithms for Stock Price Prediction Using Insider Trading Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research paper empirically investigates several machine learning algorithms to forecast stock prices depending on insider trading information. Insider trading offers special insights into market sentiment, pointing to upcoming changes in stock prices. This study examines the effectiveness of algorithms like decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM) with different kernels, and K-Means Clustering using a dataset of Tesla stock transactions. Examining past data from April 2020 to March 2023, this study focuses on how well these algorithms identify trends and forecast stock price fluctuations. The paper uses Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and feature importance analysis to optimize the feature set and, hence, increase prediction accuracy. While it requires substantially greater processing time than other models, SVM with the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel displays the best accuracy. This paper highlights the trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency in machine learning models and proposes the possibility of pooling multiple data sources to raise prediction performance. The results of this paper aim to help financial analysts and investors in choosing strong algorithms to optimize investment strategies.</description>

      <title>New Bounds for Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse variational Gaussian processes (GPs) construct tractable posterior approximations to GP models. At the core of these methods is the assumption that the true posterior distribution over training function values ${\bf f}$ and inducing variables ${\bf u}$ is approximated by a variational distribution that incorporates the conditional GP prior $p({\bf f} | {\bf u})$ in its factorization. While this assumption is considered as fundamental, we show that for model training we can relax it through the use of a more general variational distribution $q({\bf f} | {\bf u})$ that depends on $N$ extra parameters, where $N$ is the number of training examples. In GP regression, we can analytically optimize the evidence lower bound over the extra parameters and express a tractable collapsed bound that is tighter than the previous bound. The new bound is also amenable to stochastic optimization and its implementation requires minor modifications to existing sparse GP code. Further, we also describe extensions to non-Gaussian likelihoods. On several datasets we demonstrate that our method can reduce bias when learning the hyperpaparameters and can lead to better predictive performance.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Memory for Online Interdomain Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel online Gaussian process (GP) model that is capable of capturing long-term memory in sequential data in an online regression setting. Our model, Online HiPPO Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Regression (OHSGPR), leverages the HiPPO (High-order Polynomial Projection Operators) framework, which is popularized in the RNN domain due to its long-range memory modeling capabilities. We interpret the HiPPO time-varying orthogonal projections as inducing variables with time-dependent orthogonal polynomial basis functions, which allows the SGPR inducing points to memorize the process history. We show that the HiPPO framework fits naturally into the interdomain GP framework and demonstrate that the kernel matrices can also be updated online in a recurrence form based on the ODE evolution of HiPPO. We evaluate our method on time series regression tasks, showing that it outperforms the existing online GP method in terms of predictive performance and computational efficiency</description>

      <title>Learning Discontinuous Galerkin Solutions to Elliptic Problems via Small Linear Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in using deep learning and neural networks to tackle scientific problems, particularly in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, many neural network-based methods, such as physics-informed neural networks, depend on automatic differentiation and the sampling of collocation points, which can result in a lack of interpretability and lower accuracy compared to traditional numerical methods. To address this issue, we propose two approaches for learning discontinuous Galerkin solutions to PDEs using small linear convolutional neural networks. Our first approach is supervised and depends on labeled data, while our second approach is unsupervised and does not rely on any training data. In both cases, our methods use substantially fewer parameters than similar numerics-based neural networks while also demonstrating comparable accuracy to the true and DG solutions for elliptic problems.</description>

Abstract: Audiology entities are using Machine Learning (ML) models to guide their screening towards people at risk. Feature Engineering (FE) focuses on optimizing data for ML models, with evolutionary methods being effective in feature selection and construction tasks. This work aims to benchmark an evolutionary FE wrapper, using models based on decision trees as proxies. The FEDORA framework is applied to a Hearing Loss (HL) dataset, being able to reduce data dimensionality and statistically maintain baseline performance. Compared to traditional methods, FEDORA demonstrates superior performance, with a maximum balanced accuracy of 76.2%, using 57 features. The framework also generated an individual that achieved 72.8% balanced accuracy using a single feature.</description>

      <title>Spectral Journey: How Transformers Predict the Shortest Path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoder-only transformers lead to a step-change in capability of large language models. However, opinions are mixed as to whether they are really planning or reasoning. A path to making progress in this direction is to study the model's behavior in a setting with carefully controlled data. Then interpret the learned representations and reverse-engineer the computation performed internally. We study decoder-only transformer language models trained from scratch to predict shortest paths on simple, connected and undirected graphs. In this setting, the representations and the dynamics learned by the model are interpretable. We present three major results: (1) Two-layer decoder-only language models can learn to predict shortest paths on simple, connected graphs containing up to 10 nodes. (2) Models learn a graph embedding that is correlated with the spectral decomposition of the line graph. (3) Following the insights, we discover a novel approximate path-finding algorithm Spectral Line Navigator (SLN) that finds shortest path by greedily selecting nodes in the space of spectral embedding of the line graph.</description>

      <title>Low-Resolution Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expanding scale of large neural network models introduces significant challenges, driving efforts to reduce memory usage and enhance computational efficiency. Such measures are crucial to ensure the practical implementation and effective application of these sophisticated models across a wide array of use cases. This study examines the impact of parameter bit precision on model performance compared to standard 32-bit models, with a focus on multiclass object classification in images. The models analyzed include those with fully connected layers, convolutional layers, and transformer blocks, with model weight resolution ranging from 1 bit to 4.08 bits. The findings indicate that models with lower parameter bit precision achieve results comparable to 32-bit models, showing promise for use in memory-constrained devices. While low-resolution models with a small number of parameters require more training epochs to achieve accuracy comparable to 32-bit models, those with a large number of parameters achieve similar performance within the same number of epochs. Additionally, data augmentation can destabilize training in low-resolution models, but including zero as a potential value in the weight parameters helps maintain stability and prevents performance degradation. Overall, 2.32-bit weights offer the optimal balance of memory reduction, performance, and efficiency. However, further research should explore other dataset types and more complex and larger models. These findings suggest a potential new era for optimized neural network models with reduced memory requirements and improved computational efficiency, though advancements in dedicated hardware are necessary to fully realize this potential.</description>

      <title>Deep EEG Super-Resolution: Upsampling EEG Spatial Resolution with Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) activity contains a wealth of information about what is happening within the human brain. Recording more of this data has the potential to unlock endless future applications. However, the cost of EEG hardware is increasingly expensive based upon the number of EEG channels being recorded simultaneously. We combat this problem in this paper by proposing a novel deep EEG super-resolution (SR) approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This approach can produce high spatial resolution EEG data from low resolution samples, by generating channel-wise upsampled data to effectively interpolate numerous missing channels, thus reducing the need for expensive EEG equipment. We tested the performance using an EEG dataset from a mental imagery task. Our proposed GAN model provided 10^4 fold and 10^2 fold reduction in mean-squared error (MSE) and mean-absolute error (MAE), respectively, over the baseline bicubic interpolation method. We further validate our method by training a classifier on the original classification task, which displayed minimal loss in accuracy while using the super-resolved data. The proposed SR EEG by GAN is a promising approach to improve the spatial resolution of low density EEG headsets.</description>

      <title>A First-order Generative Bilevel Optimization Framework for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models, which iteratively denoise data samples to synthesize high-quality outputs, have achieved empirical success across domains. However, optimizing these models for downstream tasks often involves nested bilevel structures, such as tuning hyperparameters for fine-tuning tasks or noise schedules in training dynamics, where traditional bilevel methods fail due to the infinite-dimensional probability space and prohibitive sampling costs. We formalize this challenge as a generative bilevel optimization problem and address two key scenarios: (1) fine-tuning pre-trained models via an inference-only lower-level solver paired with a sample-efficient gradient estimator for the upper level, and (2) training diffusion models from scratch with noise schedule optimization by reparameterizing the lower-level problem and designing a computationally tractable gradient estimator. Our first-order bilevel framework overcomes the incompatibility of conventional bilevel methods with diffusion processes, offering theoretical grounding and computational practicality. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing fine-tuning and hyperparameter search baselines.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Data-Centric AI: Tabular Learning from Reinforcement Learning and Generative AI Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tabular data is one of the most widely used data formats across various domains such as bioinformatics, healthcare, and marketing. As artificial intelligence moves towards a data-centric perspective, improving data quality is essential for enhancing model performance in tabular data-driven applications. This survey focuses on data-driven tabular data optimization, specifically exploring reinforcement learning (RL) and generative approaches for feature selection and feature generation as fundamental techniques for refining data spaces. Feature selection aims to identify and retain the most informative attributes, while feature generation constructs new features to better capture complex data patterns. We systematically review existing generative methods for tabular data engineering, analyzing their latest advancements, real-world applications, and respective strengths and limitations. This survey emphasizes how RL-based and generative techniques contribute to the automation and intelligence of feature engineering. Finally, we summarize the existing challenges and discuss future research directions, aiming to provide insights that drive continued innovation in this field.</description>

      <title>PLayer-FL: A Principled Approach to Personalized Layer-wise Cross-Silo Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-identically distributed data is a major challenge in Federated Learning (FL). Personalized FL tackles this by balancing local model adaptation with global model consistency. One variant, partial FL, leverages the observation that early layers learn more transferable features by federating only early layers. However, current partial FL approaches use predetermined, architecture-specific rules to select layers, limiting their applicability. We introduce Principled Layer-wise-FL (PLayer-FL), which uses a novel federation sensitivity metric to identify layers that benefit from federation. This metric, inspired by model pruning, quantifies each layer's contribution to cross-client generalization after the first training epoch, identifying a transition point in the network where the benefits of federation diminish. We first demonstrate that our federation sensitivity metric shows strong correlation with established generalization measures across diverse architectures. Next, we show that PLayer-FL outperforms existing FL algorithms on a range of tasks, also achieving more uniform performance improvements across clients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have quickly become the state-of-the-art for generation tasks across many different data modalities. An important ability of diffusion models is the ability to encode samples from the data distribution back into the sampling prior distribution. This is useful for performing alterations to real data samples along with guided generation via the continuous adjoint equations. We propose an algebraically reversible solver for diffusion SDEs that can exactly invert real data samples into the prior distribution.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Evaluation of Generative Models on Tabular Transportation Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sharing of large-scale transportation data is beneficial for transportation planning and policymaking. However, it also raises significant security and privacy concerns, as the data may include identifiable personal information, such as individuals' home locations. To address these concerns, synthetic data generation based on real transportation data offers a promising solution that allows privacy protection while potentially preserving data utility. Although there are various synthetic data generation techniques, they are often not tailored to the unique characteristics of transportation data, such as the inherent structure of transportation networks formed by all trips in the datasets. In this paper, we use New York City taxi data as a case study to conduct a systematic evaluation of the performance of widely used tabular data generative models. In addition to traditional metrics such as distribution similarity, coverage, and privacy preservation, we propose a novel graph-based metric tailored specifically for transportation data. This metric evaluates the similarity between real and synthetic transportation networks, providing potentially deeper insights into their structural and functional alignment. We also introduced an improved privacy metric to address the limitations of the commonly-used one. Our experimental results reveal that existing tabular data generative models often fail to perform as consistently as claimed in the literature, particularly when applied to transportation data use cases. Furthermore, our novel graph metric reveals a significant gap between synthetic and real data. This work underscores the potential need to develop generative models specifically tailored to take advantage of the unique characteristics of emerging domains, such as transportation.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Vision Models for Time Series Analysis: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series analysis has witnessed the inspiring development from traditional autoregressive models, deep learning models, to recent Transformers and Large Language Models (LLMs). Efforts in leveraging vision models for time series analysis have also been made along the way but are less visible to the community due to the predominant research on sequence modeling in this domain. However, the discrepancy between continuous time series and the discrete token space of LLMs, and the challenges in explicitly modeling the correlations of variates in multivariate time series have shifted some research attentions to the equally successful Large Vision Models (LVMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). To fill the blank in the existing literature, this survey discusses the advantages of vision models over LLMs in time series analysis. It provides a comprehensive and in-depth overview of the existing methods, with dual views of detailed taxonomy that answer the key research questions including how to encode time series as images and how to model the imaged time series for various tasks. Additionally, we address the challenges in the pre- and post-processing steps involved in this framework and outline future directions to further advance time series analysis with vision models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an approach for the analysis of randomised exploration algorithms like Thompson sampling that does not rely on forced optimism or posterior inflation. With this, we demonstrate that in the $d$-dimensional linear bandit setting, when the action space is smooth and strongly convex, randomised exploration algorithms enjoy an $n$-step regret bound of the order $O(d\sqrt{n} \log(n))$. Notably, this shows for the first time that there exist non-trivial linear bandit settings where Thompson sampling can achieve optimal dimension dependence in the regret.</description>

      <title>Robust Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning via $p$-Conductances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of semi-supervised learning on graphs in the regime where data labels are scarce or possibly corrupted. We propose an approach called $p$-conductance learning that generalizes the $p$-Laplace and Poisson learning methods by introducing an objective reminiscent of $p$-Laplacian regularization and an affine relaxation of the label constraints. This leads to a family of probability measure mincut programs that balance sparse edge removal with accurate distribution separation. Our theoretical analysis connects these programs to well-known variational and probabilistic problems on graphs (including randomized cuts, effective resistance, and Wasserstein distance) and provides motivation for robustness when labels are diffused via the heat kernel. Computationally, we develop a semismooth Newton-conjugate gradient algorithm and extend it to incorporate class-size estimates when converting the continuous solutions into label assignments. Empirical results on computer vision and citation datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in low label-rate, corrupted-label, and partial-label regimes.</description>

      <title>WENDy for Nonlinear-in-Parameter ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weak-form Estimation of Non-linear Dynamics (WENDy) algorithm is extended to accommodate systems of ordinary differential equations that are nonlinear-in-parameters (NiP). The extension rests on derived analytic expressions for a likelihood function, its gradient and its Hessian matrix. WENDy makes use of these to approximate a maximum likelihood estimator based on optimization routines suited for non-convex optimization problems. The resulting parameter estimation algorithm has better accuracy, a substantially larger domain of convergence, and is often orders of magnitude faster than the conventional output error least squares method (based on forward solvers).
  The WENDy.jl algorithm is efficiently implemented in Julia. We demonstrate the algorithm's ability to accommodate the weak form optimization for both additive normal and multiplicative log-normal noise, and present results on a suite of benchmark systems of ordinary differential equations. In order to demonstrate the practical benefits of our approach, we present extensive comparisons between our method and output error methods in terms of accuracy, precision, bias, and coverage.</description>

      <title>2D Integrated Bayesian Tomography of Plasma Electron Density Profile for HL-3 Based on Gaussian Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an integrated Bayesian model that combines line integral measurements and point values using Gaussian Process (GP). The proposed method leverages Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to incorporate point values into 2D profiles and employs coordinate mapping to integrate magnetic flux information for 2D inversion. The average relative error of the reconstructed profile, using the integrated Bayesian tomography model with normalized magnetic flux, is as low as 3.60*10^(-4). Additionally, sensitivity tests were conducted on the number of grids, the standard deviation of synthetic diagnostic data, and noise levels, laying a solid foundation for the application of the model to experimental data. This work not only achieves accurate 2D inversion using the integrated Bayesian model but also provides a robust framework for decoupling pressure information from equilibrium reconstruction, thus making it possible to optimize equilibrium reconstruction using inversion results.</description>

      <title>Linear-Time User-Level DP-SCO via Robust Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User-level differentially private stochastic convex optimization (DP-SCO) has garnered significant attention due to the paramount importance of safeguarding user privacy in modern large-scale machine learning applications. Current methods, such as those based on differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), often struggle with high noise accumulation and suboptimal utility due to the need to privatize every intermediate iterate. In this work, we introduce a novel linear-time algorithm that leverages robust statistics, specifically the median and trimmed mean, to overcome these challenges. Our approach uniquely bounds the sensitivity of all intermediate iterates of SGD with gradient estimation based on robust statistics, thereby significantly reducing the gradient estimation noise for privacy purposes and enhancing the privacy-utility trade-off. By sidestepping the repeated privatization required by previous methods, our algorithm not only achieves an improved theoretical privacy-utility trade-off but also maintains computational efficiency. We complement our algorithm with an information-theoretic lower bound, showing that our upper bound is optimal up to logarithmic factors and the dependence on $\epsilon$. This work sets the stage for more robust and efficient privacy-preserving techniques in machine learning, with implications for future research and application in the field.</description>

      <title>CLEAR: Cluster-based Prompt Learning on Heterogeneous Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt learning has attracted increasing attention in the graph domain as a means to bridge the gap between pretext and downstream tasks. Existing studies on heterogeneous graph prompting typically use feature prompts to modify node features for specific downstream tasks, which do not concern the structure of heterogeneous graphs. Such a design also overlooks information from the meta-paths, which are core to learning the high-order semantics of the heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues, we propose CLEAR, a Cluster-based prompt LEARNING model on heterogeneous graphs. We present cluster prompts that reformulate downstream tasks as heterogeneous graph reconstruction. In this way, we align the pretext and downstream tasks to share the same training objective. Additionally, our cluster prompts are also injected into the meta-paths such that the prompt learning process incorporates high-order semantic information entailed by the meta-paths. Extensive experiments on downstream tasks confirm the superiority of CLEAR. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving up to 5% improvement on the F1 metric for node classification.</description>

      <title>Escaping Collapse: The Strength of Weak Data for Large Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetically-generated data plays an increasingly larger role in training large language models. However, while synthetic data has been found to be useful, studies have also shown that without proper curation it can cause LLM performance to plateau, or even "collapse", after many training iterations. In this paper, we formalize this question and develop a theoretical framework to investigate how much curation is needed in order to ensure that LLM performance continually improves. We find that the requirements are nearly minimal. We describe a training procedure that converges to an optimal LLM even if almost all of the non-synthetic training data is of poor quality. Our analysis is inspired by boosting, a classic machine learning technique that leverages a very weak learning algorithm to produce an arbitrarily good classifier. Our training procedure subsumes many recently proposed methods for training LLMs on synthetic data, and thus our analysis sheds light on why they are successful, and also suggests opportunities for future improvement. We present experiments that validate our theory, and show that dynamically focusing labeling resources on the most challenging examples -- in much the same way that boosting focuses the efforts of the weak learner -- leads to improved performance.</description>

      <title>AutoLike: Auditing Social Media Recommendations through User Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern social media platforms, such as TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube, rely on recommendation systems to personalize content for users based on user interactions with endless streams of content, such as "For You" pages. However, these complex algorithms can inadvertently deliver problematic content related to self-harm, mental health, and eating disorders. We introduce AutoLike, a framework to audit recommendation systems in social media platforms for topics of interest and their sentiments. To automate the process, we formulate the problem as a reinforcement learning problem. AutoLike drives the recommendation system to serve a particular type of content through interactions (e.g., liking). We apply the AutoLike framework to the TikTok platform as a case study. We evaluate how well AutoLike identifies TikTok content automatically across nine topics of interest; and conduct eight experiments to demonstrate how well it drives TikTok's recommendation system towards particular topics and sentiments. AutoLike has the potential to assist regulators in auditing recommendation systems for problematic content. (Warning: This paper contains qualitative examples that may be viewed as offensive or harmful.)</description>

      <title>Reevaluating Policy Gradient Methods for Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, motivated by the putative failure of naive self-play deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in adversarial imperfect-information games, researchers have developed numerous DRL algorithms based on fictitious play (FP), double oracle (DO), and counterfactual regret minimization (CFR). In light of recent results of the magnetic mirror descent algorithm, we hypothesize that simpler generic policy gradient methods like PPO are competitive with or superior to these FP, DO, and CFR-based DRL approaches. To facilitate the resolution of this hypothesis, we implement and release the first broadly accessible exact exploitability computations for four large games. Using these games, we conduct the largest-ever exploitability comparison of DRL algorithms for imperfect-information games. Over 5600 training runs, FP, DO, and CFR-based approaches fail to outperform generic policy gradient methods.

      <title>Analysis of Off-Policy $n$-Step TD-Learning with Linear Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes multi-step temporal difference (TD)-learning algorithms within the ``deadly triad'' scenario, characterized by linear function approximation, off-policy learning, and bootstrapping. In particular, we prove that $n$-step TD-learning algorithms converge to a solution as the sampling horizon $n$ increases sufficiently. The paper is divided into two parts. In the first part, we comprehensively examine the fundamental properties of their model-based deterministic counterparts, including projected value iteration, gradient descent algorithms, which can be viewed as prototype deterministic algorithms whose analysis plays a pivotal role in understanding and developing their model-free reinforcement learning counterparts. In particular, we prove that these algorithms converge to meaningful solutions when $n$ is sufficiently large. Based on these findings, in the second part, two $n$-step TD-learning algorithms are proposed and analyzed, which can be seen as the model-free reinforcement learning counterparts of the model-based deterministic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Language in the Flow of Time: Time-Series-Paired Texts Weaved into a Unified Temporal Narrative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While many advances in time series models focus exclusively on numerical data, research on multimodal time series, particularly those involving contextual textual information commonly encountered in real-world scenarios, remains in its infancy. Consequently, effectively integrating the text modality remains challenging. In this work, we highlight an intuitive yet significant observation that has been overlooked by existing works: time-series-paired texts exhibit periodic properties that closely mirror those of the original time series. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework, Texts as Time Series (TaTS), which considers the time-series-paired texts to be auxiliary variables of the time series. TaTS can be plugged into any existing numerical-only time series models and enable them to handle time series data with paired texts effectively. Through extensive experiments on both multimodal time series forecasting and imputation tasks across benchmark datasets with various existing time series models, we demonstrate that TaTS can enhance predictive performance and achieve outperformance without modifying model architectures.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Graph Contrastive Pretraining for Device-level Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised graph representation learning has driven significant advancements in domains such as social network analysis, molecular design, and electronics design automation (EDA). However, prior works in EDA have mainly focused on the representation of gate-level digital circuits, failing to capture analog and mixed-signal circuits. To address this gap, we introduce DICE: Device-level Integrated Circuits Encoder, the first self-supervised pretrained graph neural network (GNN) model for any circuit expressed at the device level. DICE is a message-passing neural network (MPNN) trained through graph contrastive learning, and its pretraining process is simulation-free, incorporating two novel data augmentation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that DICE achieves substantial performance gains across three downstream tasks, underscoring its effectiveness for both analog and digital circuits.</description>

      <title>Biologically Plausible Brain Graph Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art brain graph analysis methods fail to fully encode the small-world architecture of brain graphs (accompanied by the presence of hubs and functional modules), and therefore lack biological plausibility to some extent. This limitation hinders their ability to accurately represent the brain's structural and functional properties, thereby restricting the effectiveness of machine learning models in tasks such as brain disorder detection. In this work, we propose a novel Biologically Plausible Brain Graph Transformer (BioBGT) that encodes the small-world architecture inherent in brain graphs. Specifically, we present a network entanglement-based node importance encoding technique that captures the structural importance of nodes in global information propagation during brain graph communication, highlighting the biological properties of the brain structure. Furthermore, we introduce a functional module-aware self-attention to preserve the functional segregation and integration characteristics of brain graphs in the learned representations. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that BioBGT outperforms state-of-the-art models, enhancing biologically plausible brain graph representations for various brain graph analytical tasks</description>

Abstract: With the expansion of data availability, machine learning (ML) has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in both academia and industry. However, imbalanced data distributions are prevalent in various types of raw data and severely hinder the performance of ML by biasing the decision-making processes. To deepen the understanding of imbalanced data and facilitate the related research and applications, this survey systematically analyzing various real-world data formats and concludes existing researches for different data formats into four distinct categories: data re-balancing, feature representation, training strategy, and ensemble learning. This structured analysis help researchers comprehensively understand the pervasive nature of imbalance across diverse data format, thereby paving a clearer path toward achieving specific research goals. we provide an overview of relevant open-source libraries, spotlight current challenges, and offer novel insights aimed at fostering future advancements in this critical area of study.</description>

      <title>Modeling Time-evolving Causality over Data Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an extensive, semi-infinite collection of multivariate coevolving data sequences (e.g., sensor/web activity streams) whose observations influence each other, how can we discover the time-changing cause-and-effect relationships in co-evolving data streams? How efficiently can we reveal dynamical patterns that allow us to forecast future values? In this paper, we present a novel streaming method, ModePlait, which is designed for modeling such causal relationships (i.e., time-evolving causality) in multivariate co-evolving data streams and forecasting their future values. The solution relies on characteristics of the causal relationships that evolve over time in accordance with the dynamic changes of exogenous variables. ModePlait has the following properties: (a) Effective: it discovers the time-evolving causality in multivariate co-evolving data streams by detecting the transitions of distinct dynamical patterns adaptively. (b) Accurate: it enables both the discovery of time-evolving causality and the forecasting of future values in a streaming fashion. (c) Scalable: our algorithm does not depend on data stream length and thus is applicable to very large sequences. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of discovering the time-evolving causality as well as forecasting.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their excellent drug-like and pharmacokinetic properties, small molecule drugs are widely used to treat various diseases, making them a critical component of drug discovery. In recent years, with the rapid development of deep learning (DL) techniques, DL-based small molecule drug discovery methods have achieved excellent performance in prediction accuracy, speed, and complex molecular relationship modeling compared to traditional machine learning approaches. These advancements enhance drug screening efficiency and optimization, and they provide more precise and effective solutions for various drug discovery tasks. Contributing to this field's development, this paper aims to systematically summarize and generalize the recent key tasks and representative techniques in DL-based small molecule drug discovery in recent years. Specifically, we provide an overview of the major tasks in small molecule drug discovery and their interrelationships. Next, we analyze the six core tasks, summarizing the related methods, commonly used datasets, and technological development trends. Finally, we discuss key challenges, such as interpretability and out-of-distribution generalization, and offer our insights into future research directions for DL-assisted small molecule drug discovery.</description>

Abstract: TabPFN [Hollmann et al., 2023], a Transformer model pretrained to perform in-context learning on fresh tabular classification problems, was presented at the last ICLR conference. To better understand its behavior, we treat it as a black-box function approximator generator and observe its generated function approximations on a varied selection of training datasets. Exploring its learned inductive biases in this manner, we observe behavior that is at turns either brilliant or baffling. We conclude this post with thoughts on how these results might inform the development, evaluation, and application of prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) in the future.</description>

      <title>Few is More: Task-Efficient Skill-Discovery for Multi-Task Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a data-driven approach, offline MARL learns superior policies solely from offline datasets, ideal for domains rich in historical data but with high interaction costs and risks. However, most existing methods are task-specific, requiring retraining for new tasks, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a task-efficient multi-task offline MARL algorithm, Skill-Discovery Conservative Q-Learning (SD-CQL). Unlike existing offline skill-discovery methods, SD-CQL discovers skills by reconstructing the next observation. It then evaluates fixed and variable actions separately and employs behavior-regularized conservative Q-learning to execute the optimal action for each skill. This approach eliminates the need for local-global alignment and enables strong multi-task generalization from limited small-scale source tasks. Substantial experiments on StarCraftII demonstrates the superior generalization performance and task-efficiency of SD-CQL. It achieves the best performance on $\textbf{10}$ out of $14$ task sets, with up to $\textbf{65%}$ improvement on individual task sets, and is within $4\%$ of the best baseline on the remaining four.</description>

      <title>Neural Force Field: Learning Generalized Physical Representation from a Few Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical reasoning is a remarkable human ability that enables rapid learning and generalization from limited experience. Current AI models, despite extensive training, still struggle to achieve similar generalization, especially in Out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. This limitation stems from their inability to abstract core physical principles from observations. A key challenge is developing representations that can efficiently learn and generalize physical dynamics from minimal data. Here we present Neural Force Field (NFF) a modeling framework built on Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) that learns interpretable force field representations which can be efficiently integrated through an Ordinary Differential Equation ( ODE) solver to predict object trajectories. Unlike existing approaches that rely on high-dimensional latent spaces, NFF captures fundamental physical concepts such as gravity, support, and collision in an interpretable manner. Experiments on two challenging physical reasoning tasks demonstrate that NFF, trained with only a few examples, achieves strong generalization to unseen scenarios. This physics-grounded representation enables efficient forward-backward planning and rapid adaptation through interactive refinement. Our work suggests that incorporating physics-inspired representations into learning systems can help bridge the gap between artificial and human physical reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Task Generalization With AutoRegressive Compositional Structure: Can Learning From $\d$ Tasks Generalize to $\d^{T}$ Tasks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable task generalization, solving tasks they were never explicitly trained on with only a few demonstrations. This raises a fundamental question: When can learning from a small set of tasks generalize to a large task family? In this paper, we investigate task generalization through the lens of AutoRegressive Compositional (ARC) structure, where each task is a composition of $T$ operations, and each operation is among a finite family of $\d$ subtasks. This yields a total class of size~\( \d^\TT \). We first show that generalization to all \( \d^\TT \) tasks is theoretically achievable by training on only \( \tilde{O}(\d) \) tasks. Empirically, we demonstrate that Transformers achieve such exponential task generalization on sparse parity functions via in-context learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. We further demonstrate this generalization in arithmetic and language translation, extending beyond parity functions.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Hybrid Ensemble Model for Network Anomaly Detection: Balancing Security and Data Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving network anomaly detection has become an essential area of research due to growing concerns over the protection of sensitive data. Traditional anomaly de- tection models often prioritize accuracy while neglecting the critical aspect of privacy. In this work, we propose a hybrid ensemble model that incorporates privacy-preserving techniques to address both detection accuracy and data protection. Our model combines the strengths of several machine learning algo- rithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), to create a robust system capable of identifying network anomalies while ensuring privacy. The proposed approach in- tegrates advanced preprocessing techniques that enhance data quality and address the challenges of small sample sizes and imbalanced datasets.

      <title>End-to-End triplet loss based fine-tuning for network embedding in effective PII detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many approaches in mobile data ecosystem that inspect network traffic generated by applications running on user's device to detect personal data exfiltration from the user's device. State-of-the-art methods rely on features extracted from HTTP requests and in this context, machine learning involves training classifiers on these features and making predictions using labelled packet traces. However, most of these methods include external feature selection before model training. Deep learning, on the other hand, typically does not require such techniques, as it can autonomously learn and identify patterns in the data without external feature extraction or selection algorithms. In this article, we propose a novel deep learning based end-to-end learning framework for prediction of exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) in mobile packets. The framework employs a pre-trained large language model (LLM) and an autoencoder to generate embedding of network packets and then uses a triplet-loss based fine-tuning method to train the model, increasing detection effectiveness using two real-world datasets. We compare our proposed detection framework with other state-of-the-art works in detecting PII leaks from user's device.</description>

      <title>RoSTE: An Efficient Quantization-Aware Supervised Fine-Tuning Approach for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning is a standard method for adapting pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. Quantization has been recently studied as a post-training technique for efficient LLM deployment. To obtain quantized fine-tuned LLMs, conventional pipelines would first fine-tune the pre-trained models, followed by post-training quantization. This often yields suboptimal performance as it fails to leverage the synergy between fine-tuning and quantization. To effectively realize low-bit quantization of weights, activations, and KV caches in LLMs, we propose an algorithm named Rotated Straight-Through-Estimator (RoSTE), which combines quantization-aware supervised fine-tuning (QA-SFT) with an adaptive rotation strategy that identifies an effective rotation configuration to reduce activation outliers. We provide theoretical insights on RoSTE by analyzing its prediction error when applied to an overparameterized least square quantized training problem. Our findings reveal that the prediction error is directly proportional to the quantization error of the converged weights, which can be effectively managed through an optimized rotation configuration. Experiments on Pythia and Llama models of different sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of RoSTE. Compared to existing post-SFT quantization baselines, our method consistently achieves superior performances across various tasks and different LLM architectures.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot Concept Bottleneck Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are inherently interpretable and intervenable neural network models, which explain their final label prediction by the intermediate prediction of high-level semantic concepts. However, they require target task training to learn input-to-concept and concept-to-label mappings, incurring target dataset collections and training resources. In this paper, we present \textit{zero-shot concept bottleneck models} (Z-CBMs), which predict concepts and labels in a fully zero-shot manner without training neural networks. Z-CBMs utilize a large-scale concept bank, which is composed of millions of vocabulary extracted from the web, to describe arbitrary input in various domains. For the input-to-concept mapping, we introduce concept retrieval, which dynamically finds input-related concepts by the cross-modal search on the concept bank. In the concept-to-label inference, we apply concept regression to select essential concepts from the retrieved concepts by sparse linear regression. Through extensive experiments, we confirm that our Z-CBMs provide interpretable and intervenable concepts without any additional training.

      <title>One-shot Federated Learning Methods: A Practical Guide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-shot Federated Learning (OFL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm that constrains client-server communication to a single round, addressing privacy and communication overhead issues associated with multiple rounds of data exchange in traditional Federated Learning (FL). OFL demonstrates the practical potential for integration with future approaches that require collaborative training models, such as large language models (LLMs). However, current OFL methods face two major challenges: data heterogeneity and model heterogeneity, which result in subpar performance compared to conventional FL methods. Worse still, despite numerous studies addressing these limitations, a comprehensive summary is still lacking. To address these gaps, this paper presents a systematic analysis of the challenges faced by OFL and thoroughly reviews the current methods. We also offer an innovative categorization method and analyze the trade-offs of various techniques. Additionally, we discuss the most promising future directions and the technologies that should be integrated into the OFL field. This work aims to provide guidance and insights for future research.</description>

      <title>Scaling Law for Stochastic Gradient Descent in Quadratically Parameterized Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In machine learning, the scaling law describes how the model performance improves with the model and data size scaling up. From a learning theory perspective, this class of results establishes upper and lower generalization bounds for a specific learning algorithm. Here, the exact algorithm running using a specific model parameterization often offers a crucial implicit regularization effect, leading to good generalization. To characterize the scaling law, previous theoretical studies mainly focus on linear models, whereas, feature learning, a notable process that contributes to the remarkable empirical success of neural networks, is regretfully vacant. This paper studies the scaling law over a linear regression with the model being quadratically parameterized. We consider infinitely dimensional data and slope ground truth, both signals exhibiting certain power-law decay rates. We study convergence rates for Stochastic Gradient Descent and demonstrate the learning rates for variables will automatically adapt to the ground truth. As a result, in the canonical linear regression, we provide explicit separations for generalization curves between SGD with and without feature learning, and the information-theoretical lower bound that is agnostic to parametrization method and the algorithm. Our analysis for decaying ground truth provides a new characterization for the learning dynamic of the model.</description>

      <title>Improving Deep Regression with Tightness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For deep regression, preserving the ordinality of the targets with respect to the feature representation improves performance across various tasks. However, a theoretical explanation for the benefits of ordinality is still lacking. This work reveals that preserving ordinality reduces the conditional entropy $H(Z|Y)$ of representation $Z$ conditional on the target $Y$. However, our findings reveal that typical regression losses do little to reduce $H(Z|Y)$, even though it is vital for generalization performance. With this motivation, we introduce an optimal transport-based regularizer to preserve the similarity relationships of targets in the feature space to reduce $H(Z|Y)$. Additionally, we introduce a simple yet efficient strategy of duplicating the regressor targets, also with the aim of reducing $H(Z|Y)$. Experiments on three real-world regression tasks verify the effectiveness of our strategies to improve deep regression. Code: https://github.com/needylove/Regression_tightness.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Analysis of Discrete-Time Stochastic Interpolants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic interpolant framework offers a powerful approach for constructing generative models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to transform arbitrary data distributions. However, prior analyses of this framework have primarily focused on the continuous-time setting, assuming a perfect solution of the underlying equations. In this work, we present the first discrete-time analysis of the stochastic interpolant framework, where we introduce an innovative discrete-time sampler and derive a finite-time upper bound on its distribution estimation error. Our result provides a novel quantification of how different factors, including the distance between source and target distributions and estimation accuracy, affect the convergence rate and also offers a new principled way to design efficient schedules for convergence acceleration. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted on the discrete-time sampler to corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Interpreting and Steering Protein Language Models through Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in transformer-based language models have revolutionized natural language processing, yet understanding the internal mechanisms of these models remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the application of sparse autoencoders (SAE) to interpret the internal representations of protein language models, specifically focusing on the ESM-2 8M parameter model. By performing a statistical analysis on each latent component's relevance to distinct protein annotations, we identify potential interpretations linked to various protein characteristics, including transmembrane regions, binding sites, and specialized motifs.
  We then leverage these insights to guide sequence generation, shortlisting the relevant latent components that can steer the model towards desired targets such as zinc finger domains. This work contributes to the emerging field of mechanistic interpretability in biological sequence models, offering new perspectives on model steering for sequence design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correct way to quantify predictive uncertainty in neural networks remains a topic of active discussion. In particular, it is unclear whether the state-of-the art entropy decomposition leads to a meaningful representation of model, or epistemic, uncertainty (EU) in the light of a debate that pits ignorance against disagreement perspectives. We aim to reconcile the conflicting viewpoints by arguing that both are valid but arise from different learning situations. Notably, we show that the presence of shortcuts is decisive for EU manifesting as disagreement.</description>

      <title>Replay-free Online Continual Learning with Self-Supervised MultiPatches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online Continual Learning (OCL) methods train a model on a non-stationary data stream where only a few examples are available at a time, often leveraging replay strategies. However, usage of replay is sometimes forbidden, especially in applications with strict privacy regulations. Therefore, we propose Continual MultiPatches (CMP), an effective plug-in for existing OCL self-supervised learning strategies that avoids the use of replay samples. CMP generates multiple patches from a single example and projects them into a shared feature space, where patches coming from the same example are pushed together without collapsing into a single point. CMP surpasses replay and other SSL-based strategies on OCL streams, challenging the role of replay as a go-to solution for self-supervised OCL.</description>

      <title>Shortcut Learning Susceptibility in Vision Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shortcut learning, where machine learning models exploit spurious correlations in data instead of capturing meaningful features, poses a significant challenge to building robust and generalizable models. This phenomenon is prevalent across various machine learning applications, including vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition, where models may find unintended cues that minimize training loss but fail to capture the underlying structure of the data. Vision classifiers such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), and Vision Transformers (ViTs) leverage distinct architectural principles to process spatial and structural information, making them differently susceptible to shortcut learning. In this study, we systematically evaluate these architectures by introducing deliberate shortcuts into the dataset that are positionally correlated with class labels, creating a controlled setup to assess whether models rely on these artificial cues or learn actual distinguishing features. We perform both quantitative evaluation by training on the shortcut-modified dataset and testing them on two different test sets -- one containing the same shortcuts and another without them -- to determine the extent of reliance on shortcuts. Additionally, qualitative evaluation is performed by using network inversion-based reconstruction techniques to analyze what the models internalize in their weights, aiming to reconstruct the training data as perceived by the classifiers. We evaluate shortcut learning behavior across multiple benchmark datasets, including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10, to compare the susceptibility of different vision classifier architectures to shortcut reliance and assess their varying degrees of sensitivity to spurious correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are one of the key architectures of generative AI. Their main drawback, however, is the computational costs. This study indicates that the concept of sparsity, well known especially in statistics, can provide a pathway to more efficient diffusion pipelines. Our mathematical guarantees prove that sparsity can reduce the input dimension's influence on the computational complexity to that of a much smaller intrinsic dimension of the data. Our empirical findings confirm that inducing sparsity can indeed lead to better samples at a lower cost.</description>

      <title>Vertical Federated Continual Learning via Evolving Prototype Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) has garnered significant attention as a privacy-preserving machine learning framework for sample-aligned feature federation. However, traditional VFL approaches do not address the challenges of class and feature continual learning, resulting in catastrophic forgetting of knowledge from previous tasks. To address the above challenge, we propose a novel vertical federated continual learning method, named Vertical Federated Continual Learning via Evolving Prototype Knowledge (V-LETO), which primarily facilitates the transfer of knowledge from previous tasks through the evolution of prototypes. Specifically, we propose an evolving prototype knowledge method, enabling the global model to retain both previous and current task knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a model optimization technique that mitigates the forgetting of previous task knowledge by restricting updates to specific parameters of the local model, thereby enhancing overall performance. Extensive experiments conducted in both CIL and FIL settings demonstrate that our method, V-LETO, outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods. For example, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 10.39% and 35.15% for CIL and FIL tasks, respectively. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/V-LETO-0108/README.md.</description>

      <title>LOB-Bench: Benchmarking Generative AI for Finance - an Application to Limit Order Book Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While financial data presents one of the most challenging and interesting sequence modelling tasks due to high noise, heavy tails, and strategic interactions, progress in this area has been hindered by the lack of consensus on quantitative evaluation paradigms. To address this, we present LOB-Bench, a benchmark, implemented in python, designed to evaluate the quality and realism of generative message-by-order data for limit order books (LOB) in the LOBSTER format. Our framework measures distributional differences in conditional and unconditional statistics between generated and real LOB data, supporting flexible multivariate statistical evaluation. The benchmark also includes features commonly used LOB statistics such as spread, order book volumes, order imbalance, and message inter-arrival times, along with scores from a trained discriminator network. Lastly, LOB-Bench contains "market impact metrics", i.e. the cross-correlations and price response functions for specific events in the data. We benchmark generative autoregressive state-space models, a (C)GAN, as well as a parametric LOB model and find that the autoregressive GenAI approach beats traditional model classes.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Representation Learning for Analyzing Movement Behavior Dynamics in People Living with Dementia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In remote healthcare monitoring, time series representation learning reveals critical patient behavior patterns from high-frequency data. This study analyzes home activity data from individuals living with dementia by proposing a two-stage, self-supervised learning approach tailored to uncover low-rank structures. The first stage converts time-series activities into text sequences encoded by a pre-trained language model, providing a rich, high-dimensional latent state space using a PageRank-based method. This PageRank vector captures latent state transitions, effectively compressing complex behaviour data into a succinct form that enhances interpretability. This low-rank representation not only enhances model interpretability but also facilitates clustering and transition analysis, revealing key behavioral patterns correlated with clinicalmetrics such as MMSE and ADAS-COG scores. Our findings demonstrate the framework's potential in supporting cognitive status prediction, personalized care interventions, and large-scale health monitoring.</description>

      <title>Generalizability through Explainability: Countering Overfitting with Counterfactual Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overfitting is a well-known issue in machine learning that occurs when a model struggles to generalize its predictions to new, unseen data beyond the scope of its training set. Traditional techniques to mitigate overfitting include early stopping, data augmentation, and regularization. In this work, we demonstrate that the degree of overfitting of a trained model is correlated with the ability to generate counterfactual examples. The higher the overfitting, the easier it will be to find a valid counterfactual example for a randomly chosen input data point. Therefore, we introduce CF-Reg, a novel regularization term in the training loss that controls overfitting by ensuring enough margin between each instance and its corresponding counterfactual. Experiments conducted across multiple datasets and models show that our counterfactual regularizer generally outperforms existing regularization techniques.</description>

      <title>Understanding High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work reported that simple Bayesian optimization methods perform well for high-dimensional real-world tasks, seemingly contradicting prior work and tribal knowledge. This paper investigates the 'why'. We identify fundamental challenges that arise in high-dimensional Bayesian optimization and explain why recent methods succeed. Our analysis shows that vanishing gradients caused by Gaussian process initialization schemes play a major role in the failures of high-dimensional Bayesian optimization and that methods that promote local search behaviors are better suited for the task. We find that maximum likelihood estimation of Gaussian process length scales suffices for state-of-the-art performance. Based on this, we propose a simple variant of maximum likelihood estimation called MSR that leverages these findings to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a comprehensive set of real-world applications. We also present targeted experiments to illustrate and confirm our findings.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Symbolic Contrastive Learning for Cross-domain Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have made significant advances in natural language inference (NLI) tasks, however their sensitivity to textual perturbations and dependence on large datasets indicate an over-reliance on shallow heuristics. In contrast, inductive logic programming (ILP) excels at inferring logical relationships across diverse, sparse and limited datasets, but its discrete nature requires the inputs to be precisely specified, which limits their application. This paper proposes a bridge between the two approaches: neuro-symbolic contrastive learning. This allows for smooth and differentiable optimisation that improves logical accuracy across an otherwise discrete, noisy, and sparse topological space of logical functions.  We show that abstract logical relationships can be effectively embedded within a neuro-symbolic paradigm, by representing data as logic programs and sets of logic rules. The embedding space captures highly varied textual information with similar semantic logical relations, but can also separate similar textual relations that have dissimilar logical relations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the inference capabilities of the models in terms of generalisation and reasoning.</description>

      <title>You Do Not Fully Utilize Transformer's Representation Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to RNNs, which compress previous tokens into a single hidden state, Transformers can attend to all previous tokens directly. However, standard Transformers only use representations from the immediately preceding layer. In this paper, we show that this design choice causes representation collapse and leads to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we introduce Layer-Integrated Memory (LIMe), a simple yet powerful approach that preserves the model's overall memory footprint while expanding its representational capacity by allowing access to hidden states from earlier layers. Through extensive experiments across various architectures and different lookup mechanisms, we demonstrate consistent performance improvements on a wide range of tasks. Moreover, our analysis of the learned representation dynamics and our exploration of depthwise circuits reveal how LIMe integrates information across layers, pointing to promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>On the Importance of Embedding Norms in Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) allows training data representations without a supervised signal and has become an important paradigm in machine learning. Most SSL methods employ the cosine similarity between embedding vectors and hence effectively embed data on a hypersphere. While this seemingly implies that embedding norms cannot play any role in SSL, a few recent works have suggested that embedding norms have properties related to network convergence and confidence. In this paper, we resolve this apparent contradiction and systematically establish the embedding norm's role in SSL training. Using theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments, we show that embedding norms (i) govern SSL convergence rates and (ii) encode network confidence, with smaller norms corresponding to unexpected samples. Additionally, we show that manipulating embedding norms can have large effects on convergence speed. Our findings demonstrate that SSL embedding norms are integral to understanding and optimizing network behavior.</description>

      <title>AnomalyGFM: Graph Foundation Model for Zero/Few-shot Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) aims to identify abnormal nodes that differ from the majority of the nodes in a graph, which has been attracting significant attention in recent years. Existing generalist graph models have achieved remarkable success in different graph tasks but struggle to generalize to the GAD task. This limitation arises from their difficulty in learning generalized knowledge for capturing the inherently infrequent, irregular and heterogeneous abnormality patterns in graphs from different domains. To address this challenge, we propose AnomalyGFM, a GAD-oriented graph foundation model that supports zero-shot inference and few-shot prompt tuning for GAD in diverse graph datasets. One key insight is that graph-agnostic representations for normal and abnormal classes are required to support effective zero/few-shot GAD across different graphs. Motivated by this, AnomalyGFM is pre-trained to align data-independent, learnable normal and abnormal class prototypes with node representation residuals (i.e., representation deviation of a node from its neighbors). The residual features essentially project the node information into a unified feature space where we can effectively measure the abnormality of nodes from different graphs in a consistent way. This provides a driving force for the learning of graph-agnostic, discriminative prototypes for the normal and abnormal classes, which can be used to enable zero-shot GAD on new graphs, including very large-scale graphs. If there are few-shot labeled normal nodes available in the new graphs, AnomalyGFM can further support prompt tuning to leverage these nodes for better adaptation. Comprehensive experiments on 11 widely-used GAD datasets with real anomalies, demonstrate that AnomalyGFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods under both zero- and few-shot GAD settings.</description>

      <title>Bandit Multiclass List Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of multiclass list classification with (semi-)bandit feedback, where input examples are mapped into subsets of size $m$ of a collection of $K$ possible labels, and the feedback consists of the predicted labels which lie in the set of true labels of the given example. Our main result is for the $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-PAC variant of the problem for which we design an algorithm that returns an $\varepsilon$-optimal hypothesis with high probability using a sample complexity of $O \big( (\mathrm{poly}(K/m) + sm / \varepsilon^2) \log (|H|/\delta) \big)$ where $H$ is the underlying (finite) hypothesis class and $s$ is an upper bound on the number of true labels for a given example. This bound improves upon known bounds for combinatorial semi-bandits whenever $s \ll K$. Moreover, in the regime where $s = O(1)$ the leading terms in our bound match the corresponding full-information rates, implying that bandit feedback essentially comes at no cost. Our PAC learning algorithm is also computationally efficient given access to an ERM oracle for $H$. Additionally, we consider the regret minimization setting where data can be generated adversarially, and establish a regret bound of $\widetilde O(|H| + \sqrt{smT \log |H|})$. Our results generalize and extend those of Erez et al. (2024) who consider the simpler single-label setting corresponding to $s=m=1$, and in fact hold for the more general contextual combinatorial semi-bandit problem with $s$-sparse rewards.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Potential of Classic GNNs for Graph-level Tasks: Simple Architectures Meet Excellence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often criticized for their limited expressiveness, issues like over-smoothing and over-squashing, and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies, while Graph Transformers (GTs) are considered superior due to their global attention mechanisms. Literature frequently suggests that GTs outperform GNNs, particularly in graph-level tasks such as graph classification and regression. In this study, we explore the untapped potential of GNNs through an enhanced framework, GNN+, which integrates six widely used techniques: edge feature integration, normalization, dropout, residual connections, feed-forward networks, and positional encoding, to effectively tackle graph-level tasks. We conduct a systematic evaluation of three classic GNNs, namely GCN, GIN, and GatedGCN, enhanced by the GNN+ framework across 14 well-known graph-level datasets. Our results show that, contrary to the prevailing belief, classic GNNs excel in graph-level tasks, securing top three rankings across all datasets and achieving first place in eight, while also demonstrating greater efficiency than GTs. This highlights the potential of simple GNN architectures, challenging the belief that complex mechanisms in GTs are essential for superior graph-level performance.</description>

      <title>LiSA: Leveraging Link Recommender to Attack Graph Neural Networks via Subgraph Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in modeling data with graph structures, yet recent research reveals their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. Traditional attack methodologies, which rely on manipulating the original graph or adding links to artificially created nodes, often prove impractical in real-world settings. This paper introduces a novel adversarial scenario involving the injection of an isolated subgraph to deceive both the link recommender and the node classifier within a GNN system. Specifically, the link recommender is mislead to propose links between targeted victim nodes and the subgraph, encouraging users to unintentionally establish connections and that would degrade the node classification accuracy, thereby facilitating a successful attack. To address this, we present the LiSA framework, which employs a dual surrogate model and bi-level optimization to simultaneously meet two adversarial objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>An Uncertainty Principle for Linear Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider linear recurrent neural networks, which have become a key building block of sequence modeling due to their ability for stable and effective long-range modeling. In this paper, we aim at characterizing this ability on a simple but core copy task, whose goal is to build a linear filter of order $S$ that approximates the filter that looks $K$ time steps in the past (which we refer to as the shift-$K$ filter), where $K$ is larger than $S$. Using classical signal models and quadratic cost, we fully characterize the problem by providing lower bounds of approximation, as well as explicit filters that achieve this lower bound up to constants. The optimal performance highlights an uncertainty principle: the optimal filter has to average values around the $K$-th time step in the past with a range~(width) that is proportional to $K/S$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans develop world models that capture the underlying generation process of data. Whether neural networks can learn similar world models remains an open problem. In this work, we provide the first theoretical results for this problem, showing that in a multi-task setting, models with a low-degree bias provably recover latent data-generating variables under mild assumptions -- even if proxy tasks involve complex, non-linear functions of the latents. However, such recovery is also sensitive to model architecture. Our analysis leverages Boolean models of task solutions via the Fourier-Walsh transform and introduces new techniques for analyzing invertible Boolean transforms, which may be of independent interest. We illustrate the algorithmic implications of our results and connect them to related research areas, including self-supervised learning, out-of-distribution generalization, and the linear representation hypothesis in large language models.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel method for Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), incorporating the convex property of the value function over the belief space in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). We introduce hard- and soft-enforced convexity as two different approaches, and compare their performance against standard DRL on two well-known POMDP environments, namely the Tiger and FieldVisionRockSample problems. Our findings show that including the convexity feature can substantially increase performance of the agents, as well as increase robustness over the hyperparameter space, especially when testing on out-of-distribution domains.

      <title>Towards Seamless Hierarchical Federated Learning under Intermittent Client Participation: A Stagewise Decision-Making Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a pioneering distributed learning paradigm that enables devices/clients to build a shared global model. This global model is obtained through frequent model transmissions between clients and a central server, which may cause high latency, energy consumption, and congestion over backhaul links. To overcome these drawbacks, Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) has emerged, which organizes clients into multiple clusters and utilizes edge nodes (e.g., edge servers) for intermediate model aggregations between clients and the central server. Current research on HFL mainly focus on enhancing model accuracy, latency, and energy consumption in scenarios with a stable/fixed set of clients. However, addressing the dynamic availability of clients -- a critical aspect of real-world scenarios -- remains underexplored. This study delves into optimizing client selection and client-to-edge associations in HFL under intermittent client participation so as to minimize overall system costs (i.e., delay and energy), while achieving fast model convergence. We unveil that achieving this goal involves solving a complex NP-hard problem. To tackle this, we propose a stagewise methodology that splits the solution into two stages, referred to as Plan A and Plan B. Plan A focuses on identifying long-term clients with high chance of participation in subsequent model training rounds. Plan B serves as a backup, selecting alternative clients when long-term clients are unavailable during model training rounds. This stagewise methodology offers a fresh perspective on client selection that can enhance both HFL and conventional FL via enabling low-overhead decision-making processes. Through evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, we show that our methodology outperforms existing benchmarks in terms of model accuracy and system costs.</description>

      <title>SigGate: Enhancing Recurrent Neural Networks with Signature-Based Gating Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach that enhances recurrent neural networks (RNNs) by incorporating path signatures into their gating mechanisms. Our method modifies both Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures by replacing their forget and reset gates, respectively, with learnable path signatures. These signatures, which capture the geometric features of the entire path history, provide a richer context for controlling information flow through the network's memory. This modification allows the networks to make memory decisions based on the full historical context rather than just the current input and state. Through experimental studies, we demonstrate that our Signature-LSTM (SigLSTM) and Signature-GRU (SigGRU) models outperform their traditional counterparts across various sequential learning tasks. By leveraging path signatures in recurrent architectures, this method offers new opportunities to enhance performance in time series analysis and forecasting applications.</description>

      <title>Depth-Bounds for Neural Networks via the Braid Arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We contribute towards resolving the open question of how many hidden layers are required in ReLU networks for exactly representing all continuous and piecewise linear functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$. While the question has been resolved in special cases, the best known lower bound in general is still 2. We focus on neural networks that are compatible with certain polyhedral complexes, more precisely with the braid fan. For such neural networks, we prove a non-constant lower bound of $\Omega(\log\log d)$ hidden layers required to exactly represent the maximum of $d$ numbers. Additionally, under our assumption, we provide a combinatorial proof that 3 hidden layers are necessary to compute the maximum of 5 numbers; this had only been verified with an excessive computation so far. Finally, we show that a natural generalization of the best known upper bound to maxout networks is not tight, by demonstrating that a rank-3 maxout layer followed by a rank-2 maxout layer is sufficient to represent the maximum of 7 numbers.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization for Simultaneous Selection of Machine Learning Algorithms and Hyperparameters on Shared Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting the optimal combination of a machine learning (ML) algorithm and its hyper-parameters is crucial for the development of high-performance ML systems. However, since the combination of ML algorithms and hyper-parameters is enormous, the exhaustive validation requires a significant amount of time. Many existing studies use Bayesian optimization (BO) for accelerating the search. On the other hand, a significant difficulty is that, in general, there exists a different hyper-parameter space for each one of candidate ML algorithms. BO-based approaches typically build a surrogate model independently for each hyper-parameter space, by which sufficient observations are required for all candidate ML algorithms. In this study, our proposed method embeds different hyper-parameter spaces into a shared latent space, in which a surrogate multi-task model for BO is estimated. This approach can share information of observations from different ML algorithms by which efficient optimization is expected with a smaller number of total observations. We further propose the pre-training of the latent space embedding with an adversarial regularization, and a ranking model for selecting an effective pre-trained embedding for a given target dataset. Our empirical study demonstrates effectiveness of the proposed method through datasets from OpenML.</description>

      <title>Full Swap Regret and Discretized Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing swap regret in structured normal-form games. Players have a very large (potentially infinite) number of pure actions, but each action has an embedding into $d$-dimensional space and payoffs are given by bilinear functions of these embeddings. We provide an efficient learning algorithm for this setting that incurs at most $\tilde{O}(T^{(d+1)/(d+3)})$ swap regret after $T$ rounds.
  To achieve this, we introduce a new online learning problem we call \emph{full swap regret minimization}. In this problem, a learner repeatedly takes a (randomized) action in a bounded convex $d$-dimensional action set $\mathcal{K}$ and then receives a loss from the adversary, with the goal of minimizing their regret with respect to the \emph{worst-case} swap function mapping $\mathcal{K}$ to $\mathcal{K}$. For varied assumptions about the convexity and smoothness of the loss functions, we design algorithms with full swap regret bounds ranging from $O(T^{d/(d+2)})$ to $O(T^{(d+1)/(d+2)})$.
  Finally, we apply these tools to the problem of online forecasting to minimize calibration error, showing that several notions of calibration can be viewed as specific instances of full swap regret. In particular, we design efficient algorithms for online forecasting that guarantee at most $O(T^{1/3})$ $\ell_2$-calibration error and $O(\max(\sqrt{\epsilon T}, T^{1/3}))$ \emph{discretized-calibration} error (when the forecaster is restricted to predicting multiples of $\epsilon$).</description>

      <title>Graph Diffusion Network for Drug-Gene Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting drug-gene associations is crucial for drug development and disease treatment. While graph neural networks (GNN) have shown effectiveness in this task, they face challenges with data sparsity and efficient contrastive learning implementation. We introduce a graph diffusion network for drug-gene prediction (GDNDGP), a framework that addresses these limitations through two key innovations. First, it employs meta-path-based homogeneous graph learning to capture drug-drug and gene-gene relationships, ensuring similar entities share embedding spaces. Second, it incorporates a parallel diffusion network that generates hard negative samples during training, eliminating the need for exhaustive negative sample retrieval. Our model achieves superior performance on the DGIdb 4.0 dataset and demonstrates strong generalization capability on tripartite drug-gene-disease networks. Results show significant improvements over existing methods in drug-gene prediction tasks, particularly in handling complex heterogeneous relationships.

      <title>This looks like what? Challenges and Future Research Directions for Part-Prototype Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing interest in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has prompted research into models with built-in interpretability, the most prominent of which are part-prototype models. Part-Prototype Models (PPMs) make decisions by comparing an input image to a set of learned prototypes, providing human-understandable explanations in the form of ``this looks like that''. Despite their inherent interpretability, PPMS are not yet considered a valuable alternative to post-hoc models. In this survey, we investigate the reasons for this and provide directions for future research. We analyze papers from 2019 to 2024, and derive a taxonomy of the challenges that current PPMS face. Our analysis shows that the open challenges are quite diverse. The main concern is the quality and quantity of prototypes. Other concerns are the lack of generalization to a variety of tasks and contexts, and general methodological issues, including non-standardized evaluation. We provide ideas for future research in five broad directions: improving predictive performance, developing novel architectures grounded in theory, establishing frameworks for human-AI collaboration, aligning models with humans, and establishing metrics and benchmarks for evaluation. We hope that this survey will stimulate research and promote intrinsically interpretable models for application domains. Our list of surveyed papers is available at https://github.com/aix-group/ppm-survey.</description>

      <title>Neural Spatiotemporal Point Processes: Trends and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal point processes (STPPs) are probabilistic models for events occurring in continuous space and time. Real-world event data often exhibit intricate dependencies and heterogeneous dynamics. By incorporating modern deep learning techniques, STPPs can model these complexities more effectively than traditional approaches. Consequently, the fusion of neural methods with STPPs has become an active and rapidly evolving research area. In this review, we categorize existing approaches, unify key design choices, and explain the challenges of working with this data modality. We further highlight emerging trends and diverse application domains. Finally, we identify open challenges and gaps in the literature.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for modelling unstructured grid data in computational physics: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unstructured grid data are essential for modelling complex geometries and dynamics in computational physics. Yet, their inherent irregularity presents significant challenges for conventional machine learning (ML) techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive review of advanced ML methodologies designed to handle unstructured grid data in high-dimensional dynamical systems. Key approaches discussed include graph neural networks, transformer models with spatial attention mechanisms, interpolation-integrated ML methods, and meshless techniques such as physics-informed neural networks. These methodologies have proven effective across diverse fields, including fluid dynamics and environmental simulations. This review is intended as a guidebook for computational scientists seeking to apply ML approaches to unstructured grid data in their domains, as well as for ML researchers looking to address challenges in computational physics. It places special focus on how ML methods can overcome the inherent limitations of traditional numerical techniques and, conversely, how insights from computational physics can inform ML development. To support benchmarking, this review also provides a summary of open-access datasets of unstructured grid data in computational physics. Finally, emerging directions such as generative models with unstructured data, reinforcement learning for mesh generation, and hybrid physics-data-driven paradigms are discussed to inspire future advancements in this evolving field.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein distributional adversarial training for deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Design of adversarial attacks for deep neural networks, as well as methods of adversarial training against them, are subject of intense research. In this paper, we propose methods to train against distributional attack threats, extending the TRADES method used for pointwise attacks. Our approach leverages recent contributions and relies on sensitivity analysis for Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization problems. We introduce an efficient fine-tuning method which can be deployed on a previously trained model. We test our methods on a range of pre-trained models on RobustBench. These experimental results demonstrate the additional training enhances Wasserstein distributional robustness, while maintaining original levels of pointwise robustness, even for already very successful networks. The improvements are less marked for models pre-trained using huge synthetic datasets of 20-100M images. However, remarkably, sometimes our methods are still able to improve their performance even when trained using only the original training dataset (50k images).</description>

      <title>The Accuracy Cost of Weakness: A Theoretical Analysis of Fixed-Segment Weak Labeling for Events in Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate labels are critical for deriving robust machine learning models. Labels are used to train supervised learning models and to evaluate most machine learning paradigms. In this paper, we model the accuracy and cost of a common weak labeling process where annotators assign presence or absence labels to fixed-length data segments for a given event class. The annotator labels a segment as "present" if it sufficiently covers an event from that class, e.g., a birdsong sound event in audio data. We analyze how the segment length affects the label accuracy and the required number of annotations, and compare this fixed-length labeling approach with an oracle method that uses the true event activations to construct the segments. Furthermore, we quantify the gap between these methods and verify that in most realistic scenarios the oracle method is better than the fixed-length labeling method in both accuracy and cost. Our findings provide a theoretical justification for adaptive weak labeling strategies that mimic the oracle process, and a foundation for optimizing weak labeling processes in sequence labeling tasks.</description>

      <title>Simple Path Structural Encoding for Graph Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph transformers extend global self-attention to graph-structured data, achieving notable success in graph learning. Recently, random walk structural encoding (RWSE) has been found to further enhance their predictive power by encoding both structural and positional information into the edge representation. However, RWSE cannot always distinguish between edges that belong to different local graph patterns, which reduces its ability to capture the full structural complexity of graphs. This work introduces Simple Path Structural Encoding (SPSE), a novel method that utilizes simple path counts for edge encoding. We show theoretically and experimentally that SPSE overcomes the limitations of RWSE, providing a richer representation of graph structures, particularly for capturing local cyclic patterns. To make SPSE computationally tractable, we propose an efficient approximate algorithm for simple path counting. SPSE demonstrates significant performance improvements over RWSE on various benchmarks, including molecular and long-range graph datasets, achieving statistically significant gains in discriminative tasks. These results pose SPSE as a powerful edge encoding alternative for enhancing the expressivity of graph transformers.</description>

      <title>Language Agents as Digital Representatives in Collective Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the process of collective decision-making, in which a group of individuals interactively select a preferred outcome from among a universe of alternatives. In this context, "representation" is the activity of making an individual's preferences present in the process via participation by a proxy agent -- i.e. their "representative". To this end, learned models of human behavior have the potential to fill this role, with practical implications for multi-agent scenario studies and mechanism design. In this work, we investigate the possibility of training \textit{language agents} to behave in the capacity of representatives of human agents, appropriately expressing the preferences of those individuals whom they stand for. First, we formalize the setting of \textit{collective decision-making} -- as the episodic process of interaction between a group of agents and a decision mechanism. On this basis, we then formalize the problem of \textit{digital representation} -- as the simulation of an agent's behavior to yield equivalent outcomes from the mechanism. Finally, we conduct an empirical case study in the setting of \textit{consensus-finding} among diverse humans, and demonstrate the feasibility of fine-tuning large language models to act as digital representatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly used in safety-critical applications. Reliable fault analysis and mitigation are essential to ensure their functionality in harsh environments that contain high radiation levels. This study analyses the impact of multiple single-bit single-event upsets in DNNs by performing fault injection at the level of a DNN model. Additionally, a fault aware training (FAT) methodology is proposed that improves the DNNs' robustness to faults without any modification to the hardware. Experimental results show that the FAT methodology improves the tolerance to faults up to a factor 3.</description>

      <title>LoRA Training Provably Converges to a Low-Rank Global Minimum or It Fails Loudly (But it Probably Won't Fail)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard approach for fine-tuning large foundation models. However, our theoretical understanding of LoRA remains limited as prior analyses of LoRA's training dynamics either rely on linearization arguments or consider highly simplified setups. In this work, we analyze the LoRA loss landscape without such restrictive assumptions. We define two regimes: a ``special regime'', which includes idealized setups where linearization arguments hold, and a ``generic regime'' representing more realistic setups where linearization arguments do not hold. In the generic regime, we show that LoRA training converges to a global minimizer with low rank and small magnitude, or a qualitatively distinct solution with high rank and large magnitude. Finally, we argue that the zero-initialization and weight decay in LoRA training induce an implicit bias toward the low-rank, small-magnitude region of the parameter space -- where global minima lie -- thus shedding light on why LoRA training usually succeeds in finding global minima.</description>

      <title>A hierarchical approach for assessing the vulnerability of tree-based classification models to membership inference attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models can inadvertently expose confidential properties of their training data, making them vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIA). While numerous evaluation methods exist, many require computationally expensive processes, such as training multiple shadow models. This article presents two new complementary approaches for efficiently identifying vulnerable tree-based models: an ante-hoc analysis of hyperparameter choices and a post-hoc examination of trained model structure. While these new methods cannot certify whether a model is safe from MIA, they provide practitioners with a means to significantly reduce the number of models that need to undergo expensive MIA assessment through a hierarchical filtering approach.
  More specifically, it is shown that the rank order of disclosure risk for different hyperparameter combinations remains consistent across datasets, enabling the development of simple, human-interpretable rules for identifying relatively high-risk models before training. While this ante-hoc analysis cannot determine absolute safety since this also depends on the specific dataset, it allows the elimination of unnecessarily risky configurations during hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, computationally inexpensive structural metrics serve as indicators of MIA vulnerability, providing a second filtering stage to identify risky models after training but before conducting expensive attacks. Empirical results show that hyperparameter-based risk prediction rules can achieve high accuracy in predicting the most at risk combinations of hyperparameters across different tree-based model types, while requiring no model training. Moreover, target model accuracy is not seen to correlate with privacy risk, suggesting opportunities to optimise model configurations for both performance and privacy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of uncertainty quantification in time series forecasting by exploiting observations at correlated sequences. Relational deep learning methods leveraging graph representations are among the most effective tools for obtaining point estimates from spatiotemporal data and correlated time series. However, the problem of exploiting relational structures to estimate the uncertainty of such predictions has been largely overlooked in the same context. To this end, we propose a novel distribution-free approach based on the conformal prediction framework and quantile regression. Despite the recent applications of conformal prediction to sequential data, existing methods operate independently on each target time series and do not account for relationships among them when constructing the prediction interval. We fill this void by introducing a novel conformal prediction method based on graph deep learning operators. Our method, named Conformal Relational Prediction (CoRel), does not require the relational structure (graph) to be known as a prior and can be applied on top of any pre-trained time series predictor. Additionally, CoRel includes an adaptive component to handle non-exchangeable data and changes in the input time series. Our approach provides accurate coverage and archives state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification in relevant benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Learning to Predict Global Atrial Fibrillation Dynamics from Sparse Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catheter ablation of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) consists of a one-size-fits-all treatment with limited success in persistent AF. This may be due to our inability to map the dynamics of AF with the limited resolution and coverage provided by sequential contact mapping catheters, preventing effective patient phenotyping for personalised, targeted ablation. Here we introduce FibMap, a graph recurrent neural network model that reconstructs global AF dynamics from sparse measurements. Trained and validated on 51 non-contact whole atria recordings, FibMap reconstructs whole atria dynamics from 10% surface coverage, achieving a 210% lower mean absolute error and an order of magnitude higher performance in tracking phase singularities compared to baseline methods. Clinical utility of FibMap is demonstrated on real-world contact mapping recordings, achieving reconstruction fidelity comparable to non-contact mapping. FibMap's state-spaces and patient-specific parameters offer insights for electrophenotyping AF. Integrating FibMap into clinical practice could enable personalised AF care and improve outcomes.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design with Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a computationally efficient method for the automation of inverse design in science and engineering. Based on simple least-square regression, the underlying dynamic mode decomposition algorithm can be used to construct a low-rank subspace spanning multiple experiments in parameter space. The proposed inverse design dynamic mode composition (ID-DMD) algorithm leverages the computed low-dimensional subspace to enable fast digital design and optimization on laptop-level computing, including the potential to prescribe the dynamics themselves. Moreover, the method is robust to noise, physically interpretable, and can provide uncertainty quantification metrics. The architecture can also efficiently scale to large-scale design problems using randomized algorithms in the ID-DMD. The simplicity of the method and its implementation are highly attractive in practice, and the ID-DMD has been demonstrated to be an order of magnitude more accurate than competing methods while simultaneously being 3-5 orders faster on challenging engineering design problems ranging from structural vibrations to fluid dynamics. Due to its speed, robustness, interpretability, and ease-of-use, ID-DMD in comparison with other leading machine learning methods represents a significant advancement in data-driven methods for inverse design and optimization, promising a paradigm shift in how to approach inverse design in practice.</description>

      <title>On Agnostic PAC Learning in the Small Error Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary classification in the classic PAC model exhibits a curious phenomenon: Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) learners are suboptimal in the realizable case yet optimal in the agnostic case. Roughly speaking, this owes itself to the fact that non-realizable distributions $\mathcal{D}$ are simply more difficult to learn than realizable distributions -- even when one discounts a learner's error by $\mathrm{err}(h^*_{\mathcal{D}})$, the error of the best hypothesis in $\mathcal{H}$ for $\mathcal{D}$. Thus, optimal agnostic learners are permitted to incur excess error on (easier-to-learn) distributions $\mathcal{D}$ for which $\tau = \mathrm{err}(h^*_{\mathcal{D}})$ is small.
  Recent work of Hanneke, Larsen, and Zhivotovskiy (FOCS `24) addresses this shortcoming by including $\tau$ itself as a parameter in the agnostic error term. In this more fine-grained model, they demonstrate tightness of the error lower bound $\tau + \Omega \left(\sqrt{\frac{\tau (d + \log(1 / \delta))}{m}} + \frac{d + \log(1 / \delta)}{m} \right)$ in a regime where $\tau &gt; d/m$, and leave open the question of whether there may be a higher lower bound when $\tau \approx d/m$, with $d$ denoting $\mathrm{VC}(\mathcal{H})$. In this work, we resolve this question by exhibiting a learner which achieves error $c \cdot \tau + O \left(\sqrt{\frac{\tau (d + \log(1 / \delta))}{m}} + \frac{d + \log(1 / \delta)}{m} \right)$ for a constant $c \leq 2.1$, thus matching the lower bound when $\tau \approx d/m$. Further, our learner is computationally efficient and is based upon careful aggregations of ERM classifiers, making progress on two other questions of Hanneke, Larsen, and Zhivotovskiy (FOCS `24). We leave open the interesting question of whether our approach can be refined to lower the constant from 2.1 to 1, which would completely settle the complexity of agnostic learning.</description>

      <title>Eidetic Learning: an Efficient and Provable Solution to Catastrophic Forgetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting -- the phenomenon of a neural network learning a task t1 and losing the ability to perform it after being trained on some other task t2 -- is a long-standing problem for neural networks [McCloskey and Cohen, 1989]. We present a method, Eidetic Learning, that provably solves catastrophic forgetting. A network trained with Eidetic Learning -- here, an EideticNet -- requires no rehearsal or replay. We consider successive discrete tasks and show how at inference time an EideticNet automatically routes new instances without auxiliary task information. An EideticNet bears a family resemblance to the sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts layer Shazeer et al. [2016] in that network capacity is partitioned across tasks and the network itself performs data-conditional routing. An EideticNet is easy to implement and train, is efficient, and has time and space complexity linear in the number of parameters. The guarantee of our method holds for normalization layers of modern neural networks during both pre-training and fine-tuning. We show with a variety of network architectures and sets of tasks that EideticNets are immune to forgetting. While the practical benefits of EideticNets are substantial, we believe they can be benefit practitioners and theorists alike. The code for training EideticNets is available at \href{https://github.com/amazon-science/eideticnet-training}{this https URL}.</description>

      <title>Scalable First-order Method for Certifying Optimal k-Sparse GLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of certifying optimality for sparse generalized linear models (GLMs), where sparsity is enforced through an $\ell_0$ cardinality constraint. While branch-and-bound (BnB) frameworks can certify optimality by pruning nodes using dual bounds, existing methods for computing these bounds are either computationally intensive or exhibit slow convergence, limiting their scalability to large-scale problems. To address this challenge, we propose a first-order proximal gradient algorithm designed to solve the perspective relaxation of the problem within a BnB framework. Specifically, we formulate the relaxed problem as a composite optimization problem and demonstrate that the proximal operator of the non-smooth component can be computed exactly in log-linear time complexity, eliminating the need to solve a computationally expensive second-order cone program. Furthermore, we introduce a simple restart strategy that enhances convergence speed while maintaining low per-iteration complexity. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach significantly accelerates dual bound computations and is highly effective in providing optimality certificates for large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>AttentionSmithy: A Modular Framework for Rapid Transformer Development and Customization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer architectures have transformed AI applications but remain complex to customize for domain experts lacking low-level implementation expertise. We introduce AttentionSmithy, a modular software package that simplifies transformer innovation by breaking down key components into reusable building blocks: attention modules, feed-forward networks, normalization layers, and positional encodings. Users can rapidly prototype and evaluate transformer variants without extensive coding. Our framework supports four positional encoding strategies and integrates with neural architecture search for automated design. We validate AttentionSmithy by replicating the original transformer under resource constraints and optimizing translation performance by combining positional encodings. Additionally, we demonstrate its adaptability in gene-specific modeling, achieving over 95% accuracy in cell type classification. These case studies highlight AttentionSmithy's potential to accelerate research across diverse fields by removing framework implementation barriers.</description>

      <title>When and How Does CLIP Enable Domain and Compositional Generalization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable generalization performance of contrastive vision-language models like CLIP is often attributed to the diversity of their training distributions. However, key questions remain unanswered: Can CLIP generalize to an entirely unseen domain when trained on a diverse mixture of domains (domain generalization)? Can it generalize to unseen classes within partially seen domains (compositional generalization)? What factors affect such generalization? To answer these questions, we trained CLIP models on systematically constructed training distributions with controlled domain diversity and object class exposure. Our experiments show that domain diversity is essential for both domain and compositional generalization, yet compositional generalization can be surprisingly weaker than domain generalization when the training distribution contains a suboptimal subset of the test domain. Through data-centric and mechanistic analyses, we find that successful generalization requires learning of shared representations already in intermediate layers and shared circuitry.</description>

      <title>EQ-VAE: Equivariance Regularized Latent Space for Improved Generative Image Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent generative models have emerged as a leading approach for high-quality image synthesis. These models rely on an autoencoder to compress images into a latent space, followed by a generative model to learn the latent distribution. We identify that existing autoencoders lack equivariance to semantic-preserving transformations like scaling and rotation, resulting in complex latent spaces that hinder generative performance. To address this, we propose EQ-VAE, a simple regularization approach that enforces equivariance in the latent space, reducing its complexity without degrading reconstruction quality. By finetuning pre-trained autoencoders with EQ-VAE, we enhance the performance of several state-of-the-art generative models, including DiT, SiT, REPA and MaskGIT, achieving a 7 speedup on DiT-XL/2 with only five epochs of SD-VAE fine-tuning. EQ-VAE is compatible with both continuous and discrete autoencoders, thus offering a versatile enhancement for a wide range of latent generative models.

      <title>Diffusion Models for Molecules: A Survey of Methods and Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative tasks about molecules, including but not limited to molecule generation, are crucial for drug discovery and material design, and have consistently attracted significant attention. In recent years, diffusion models have emerged as an impressive class of deep generative models, sparking extensive research and leading to numerous studies on their application to molecular generative tasks. Despite the proliferation of related work, there remains a notable lack of up-to-date and systematic surveys in this area. Particularly, due to the diversity of diffusion model formulations, molecular data modalities, and generative task types, the research landscape is challenging to navigate, hindering understanding and limiting the area's growth. To address this, this paper conducts a comprehensive survey of diffusion model-based molecular generative methods. We systematically review the research from the perspectives of methodological formulations, data modalities, and task types, offering a novel taxonomy. This survey aims to facilitate understanding and further flourishing development in this area. The relevant papers are summarized at: https://github.com/AzureLeon1/awesome-molecular-diffusion-models.</description>

      <title>Robust Learning of Multi-index Models via Iterative Subspace Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the task of learning Multi-Index Models (MIMs) with label noise under the Gaussian distribution. A $K$-MIM is any function $f$ that only depends on a $K$-dimensional subspace. We focus on well-behaved MIMs with finite ranges that satisfy certain regularity properties. Our main contribution is a general robust learner that is qualitatively optimal in the Statistical Query (SQ) model. Our algorithm iteratively constructs better approximations to the defining subspace by computing low-degree moments conditional on the projection to the subspace computed thus far, and adding directions with relatively large empirical moments. This procedure efficiently finds a subspace $V$ so that $f(\mathbf{x})$ is close to a function of the projection of $\mathbf{x}$ onto $V$. Conversely, for functions for which these conditional moments do not help, we prove an SQ lower bound suggesting that no efficient learner exists.
  As applications, we provide faster robust learners for the following concept classes:
  * {\bf Multiclass Linear Classifiers} We give a constant-factor approximate agnostic learner with sample complexity $N = O(d) 2^{\mathrm{poly}(K/\epsilon)}$ and computational complexity $\mathrm{poly}(N ,d)$. This is the first constant-factor agnostic learner for this class whose complexity is a fixed-degree polynomial in $d$.
  * {\bf Intersections of Halfspaces} We give an approximate agnostic learner for this class achieving 0-1 error $K \tilde{O}(\mathrm{OPT}) + \epsilon$ with sample complexity $N=O(d^2) 2^{\mathrm{poly}(K/\epsilon)}$ and computational complexity $\mathrm{poly}(N ,d)$. This is the first agnostic learner for this class with near-linear error dependence and complexity a fixed-degree polynomial in $d$.
  Furthermore, we show that in the presence of random classification noise, the complexity of our algorithm scales polynomially with $1/\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>Diffusing DeBias: a Recipe for Turning a Bug into a Feature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning model effectiveness in classification tasks is often challenged by the quality and quantity of training data which, whenever containing strong spurious correlations between specific attributes and target labels, can result in unrecoverable biases in model predictions. Tackling these biases is crucial in improving model generalization and trust, especially in real-world scenarios. This paper presents Diffusing DeBias (DDB), a novel approach acting as a plug-in for common methods in model debiasing while exploiting the inherent bias-learning tendency of diffusion models. Our approach leverages conditional diffusion models to generate synthetic bias-aligned images, used to train a bias amplifier model, to be further employed as an auxiliary method in different unsupervised debiasing approaches. Our proposed method, which also tackles the common issue of training set memorization typical of this type of tech- niques, beats current state-of-the-art in multiple benchmark datasets by significant margins, demonstrating its potential as a versatile and effective tool for tackling dataset bias in deep learning applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Utility of Higher-Order Information in Relational Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order information is crucial for relational learning in many domains where relationships extend beyond pairwise interactions. Hypergraphs provide a natural framework for modeling such relationships, which has motivated recent extensions of graph neural net- work architectures to hypergraphs. However, comparisons between hypergraph architectures and standard graph-level models remain limited. In this work, we systematically evaluate a selection of hypergraph-level and graph-level architectures, to determine their effectiveness in leveraging higher-order information in relational learning. Our results show that graph-level architectures applied to hypergraph expansions often outperform hypergraph- level ones, even on inputs that are naturally parametrized as hypergraphs. As an alternative approach for leveraging higher-order information, we propose hypergraph-level encodings based on classical hypergraph characteristics. While these encodings do not significantly improve hypergraph architectures, they yield substantial performance gains when combined with graph-level models. Our theoretical analysis shows that hypergraph-level encodings provably increase the representational power of message-passing graph neural networks beyond that of their graph-level counterparts.</description>

      <title>DiffMS: Diffusion Generation of Molecules Conditioned on Mass Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass spectrometry plays a fundamental role in elucidating the structures of unknown molecules and subsequent scientific discoveries. One formulation of the structure elucidation task is the conditional $\textit{de novo}$ generation of molecular structure given a mass spectrum. Toward a more accurate and efficient scientific discovery pipeline for small molecules, we present DiffMS, a formula-restricted encoder-decoder generative network that achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. The encoder utilizes a transformer architecture and models mass spectra domain knowledge such as peak formulae and neutral losses, and the decoder is a discrete graph diffusion model restricted by the heavy-atom composition of a known chemical formula. To develop a robust decoder that bridges latent embeddings and molecular structures, we pretrain the diffusion decoder with fingerprint-structure pairs, which are available in virtually infinite quantities, compared to structure-spectrum pairs that number in the tens of thousands. Extensive experiments on established benchmarks show that DiffMS outperforms existing models on $\textit{de novo}$ molecule generation. We provide several ablations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our diffusion and pretraining approaches and show consistent performance scaling with increasing pretraining dataset size. DiffMS code is publicly available at https://github.com/coleygroup/DiffMS.</description>

Abstract: When deployed in dynamic environments, AI agents will inevitably encounter challenges that exceed their individual capabilities. Leveraging assistance from expert agents-whether human or AI-can significantly enhance safety and performance in such situations. However, querying experts is often costly, necessitating the development of agents that can efficiently request and utilize expert guidance. In this paper, we introduce a fundamental coordination problem called Learning to Yield and Request Control (YRC), where the objective is to learn a strategy that determines when to act autonomously and when to seek expert assistance. We consider a challenging practical setting in which an agent does not interact with experts during training but must adapt to novel environmental changes and expert interventions at test time. To facilitate empirical research, we introduce YRC-Bench, an open-source benchmark featuring diverse domains. YRC-Bench provides a standardized Gym-like API, simulated experts, evaluation pipeline, and implementation of competitive baselines. Towards tackling the YRC problem, we propose a novel validation approach and investigate the performance of various learning methods across diverse environments, yielding insights that can guide future research.</description>

      <title>Rolling Ahead Diffusion for Traffic Scene Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realistic driving simulation requires that NPCs not only mimic natural driving behaviors but also react to the behavior of other simulated agents. Recent developments in diffusion-based scenario generation focus on creating diverse and realistic traffic scenarios by jointly modelling the motion of all the agents in the scene. However, these traffic scenarios do not react when the motion of agents deviates from their modelled trajectories. For example, the ego-agent can be controlled by a stand along motion planner. To produce reactive scenarios with joint scenario models, the model must regenerate the scenario at each timestep based on new observations in a Model Predictive Control (MPC) fashion. Although reactive, this method is time-consuming, as one complete possible future for all NPCs is generated per simulation step. Alternatively, one can utilize an autoregressive model (AR) to predict only the immediate next-step future for all NPCs. Although faster, this method lacks the capability for advanced planning. We present a rolling diffusion based traffic scene generation model which mixes the benefits of both methods by predicting the next step future and simultaneously predicting partially noised further future steps at the same time. We show that such model is efficient compared to diffusion model based AR, achieving a beneficial compromise between reactivity and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Censor Dependent Variational Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of variational inference in latent variable models for survival analysis, emphasizing the distinctive challenges associated with applying variational methods to survival data. We identify a critical weakness in the existing methodology, demonstrating how a poorly designed variational distribution may hinder the objective of survival analysis tasks--modeling time-to-event distributions. We prove that the optimal variational distribution, which perfectly bounds the log-likelihood, may depend on the censoring mechanism. To address this issue, we propose censor-dependent variational inference (CDVI), tailored for latent variable models in survival analysis. More practically, we introduce CD-CVAE, a V-structure Variational Autoencoder (VAE) designed for the scalable implementation of CDVI. Further discussion extends some existing theories and training techniques to survival analysis. Extensive experiments validate our analysis and demonstrate significant improvements in the estimation of individual survival distributions.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs Recognize Your Preferences? Evaluating Personalized Preference Following in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as chatbots, yet their ability to personalize responses to user preferences remains limited. We introduce PrefEval, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to infer, memorize and adhere to user preferences in a long-context conversational setting. PrefEval comprises 3,000 manually curated user preference and query pairs spanning 20 topics. PrefEval contains user personalization or preference information in both explicit and implicit forms, and evaluates LLM performance using a generation and a classification task. With PrefEval, we evaluated the aforementioned preference following capabilities of 10 open-source and proprietary LLMs in multi-session conversations with varying context lengths up to 100k tokens. We benchmark with various prompting, iterative feedback, and retrieval-augmented generation methods. Our benchmarking effort reveals that state-of-the-art LLMs face significant challenges in proactively following users' preferences during conversations. In particular, in zero-shot settings, preference following accuracy falls below 10% at merely 10 turns (~3k tokens) across most evaluated models. Even with advanced prompting and retrieval methods, preference following still deteriorates in long-context conversations. Furthermore, we show that fine-tuning on PrefEval significantly improves performance. We believe PrefEval serves as a valuable resource for measuring, understanding, and enhancing LLMs' preference following abilities, paving the way for personalized conversational agents. Our code and dataset are available at https://prefeval.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Score-of-Mixture Training: Training One-Step Generative Models Made Simple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Score-of-Mixture Training (SMT), a novel framework for training one-step generative models by minimizing a class of divergences called the $\alpha$-skew Jensen-Shannon divergence. At its core, SMT estimates the score of mixture distributions between real and fake samples across multiple noise levels. Similar to consistency models, our approach supports both training from scratch (SMT) and distillation using a pretrained diffusion model, which we call Score-of-Mixture Distillation (SMD). It is simple to implement, requires minimal hyperparameter tuning, and ensures stable training. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 64x64 show that SMT/SMD are competitive with and can even outperform existing methods.</description>

      <title>Designing a Conditional Prior Distribution for Flow-Based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently shown impressive performance for conditional generation tasks, such as text-to-image generation. However, current methods transform a general unimodal noise distribution to a specific mode of the target data distribution. As such, every point in the initial source distribution can be mapped to every point in the target distribution, resulting in long average paths. To this end, in this work, we tap into a non-utilized property of conditional flow-based models: the ability to design a non-trivial prior distribution. Given an input condition, such as a text prompt, we first map it to a point lying in data space, representing an ``average" data point with the minimal average distance to all data points of the same conditional mode (e.g., class). We then utilize the flow matching formulation to map samples from a parametric distribution centered around this point to the conditional target distribution. Experimentally, our method significantly improves training times and generation efficiency (FID, KID and CLIP alignment scores) compared to baselines, producing high quality samples using fewer sampling steps.</description>

      <title>Variational Rectified Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Variational Rectified Flow Matching, a framework that enhances classic rectified flow matching by modeling multi-modal velocity vector-fields. At inference time, classic rectified flow matching 'moves' samples from a source distribution to the target distribution by solving an ordinary differential equation via integration along a velocity vector-field. At training time, the velocity vector-field is learnt by linearly interpolating between coupled samples one drawn from the source and one drawn from the target distribution randomly. This leads to ''ground-truth'' velocity vector-fields that point in different directions at the same location, i.e., the velocity vector-fields are multi-modal/ambiguous. However, since training uses a standard mean-squared-error loss, the learnt velocity vector-field averages ''ground-truth'' directions and isn't multi-modal. In contrast, variational rectified flow matching learns and samples from multi-modal flow directions. We show on synthetic data, MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet that variational rectified flow matching leads to compelling results.</description>

      <title>Can this Model Also Recognize Dogs? Zero-Shot Model Search from Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing numbers of publicly available models, there are probably pretrained, online models for most tasks users require. However, current model search methods are rudimentary, essentially a text-based search in the documentation, thus users cannot find the relevant models. This paper presents ProbeLog, a method for retrieving classification models that can recognize a target concept, such as "Dog", without access to model metadata or training data. Differently from previous probing methods, ProbeLog computes a descriptor for each output dimension (logit) of each model, by observing its responses on a fixed set of inputs (probes). Our method supports both logit-based retrieval ("find more logits like this") and zero-shot, text-based retrieval ("find all logits corresponding to dogs"). As probing-based representations require multiple costly feedforward passes through the model, we develop a method, based on collaborative filtering, that reduces the cost of encoding repositories by 3x. We demonstrate that ProbeLog achieves high retrieval accuracy, both in real-world and fine-grained search tasks and is scalable to full-size repositories.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Benefit and Limitation of Diffusion Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion language models have emerged as a promising approach for text generation. One would naturally expect this method to be an efficient replacement for autoregressive models since multiple tokens can be sampled in parallel during each diffusion step. However, its efficiency-accuracy trade-off is not yet well understood. In this paper, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of a widely used type of diffusion language model, the Masked Diffusion Model (MDM), and find that its effectiveness heavily depends on the target evaluation metric. Under mild conditions, we prove that when using perplexity as the metric, MDMs can achieve near-optimal perplexity in sampling steps regardless of sequence length, demonstrating that efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing performance. However, when using the sequence error rate--which is important for understanding the "correctness" of a sequence, such as a reasoning chain--we show that the required sampling steps must scale linearly with sequence length to obtain "correct" sequences, thereby eliminating MDM's efficiency advantage over autoregressive models. Our analysis establishes the first theoretical foundation for understanding the benefits and limitations of MDMs. All theoretical findings are supported by empirical studies.</description>

      <title>ReasonFlux: Hierarchical LLM Reasoning via Scaling Thought Templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present that hierarchical LLM reasoning via scaling thought templates can effectively optimize the reasoning search space and outperform the mathematical reasoning capabilities of powerful LLMs like OpenAI o1-preview and DeepSeek V3. We train our ReasonFlux-32B model with only 8 GPUs and introduces three innovations: (i) a structured and generic thought template library, containing around 500 high-level thought templates capable of generalizing to similar or relevant reasoning problems; (ii) performing hierarchical reinforcement learning on a sequence of thought templates instead of long CoTs, optimizing a base LLM to plan out an optimal template trajectory for gradually handling complex problems; (iii) a brand new inference scaling system that enables hierarchical LLM reasoning by adaptively scaling thought templates at inference time. With a template trajectory containing sequential thought templates, our ReasonFlux-32B significantly advances math reasoning capabilities to state-of-the-art levels. Notably, on the MATH benchmark, it achieves an accuracy of 91.2% and surpasses o1-preview by 6.7%. On the USA Math Olympiad (AIME) benchmark, ReasonFlux-32B solves an average of 56.7% of problems, surpassing o1-preview and DeepSeek-V3 by 27% and 45%, respectively.

      <title>Democratizing AI Governance: Balancing Expertise and Public Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, with their profound societal impacts, raise critical challenges for governance. Historically, technological innovations have been governed by concentrated expertise with limited public input. However, AI's pervasive influence across domains such as healthcare, employment, and justice necessitates inclusive governance approaches. This article explores the tension between expert-led oversight and democratic participation, analyzing models of participatory and deliberative democracy. Using case studies from France and Brazil, we highlight how inclusive frameworks can bridge the gap between technical complexity and public accountability. Recommendations are provided for integrating these approaches into a balanced governance model tailored to the European Union, emphasizing transparency, diversity, and adaptive regulation to ensure that AI governance reflects societal values while maintaining technical rigor. This analysis underscores the importance of hybrid frameworks that unite expertise and public voice in shaping the future of AI policy.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput SAT Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel technique for GPU-accelerated Boolean satisfiability (SAT) sampling. Unlike conventional sampling algorithms that directly operate on conjunctive normal form (CNF), our method transforms the logical constraints of SAT problems by factoring their CNF representations into simplified multi-level, multi-output Boolean functions. It then leverages gradient-based optimization to guide the search for a diverse set of valid solutions. Our method operates directly on the circuit structure of refactored SAT instances, reinterpreting the SAT problem as a supervised multi-output regression task. This differentiable technique enables independent bit-wise operations on each tensor element, allowing parallel execution of learning processes. As a result, we achieve GPU-accelerated sampling with significant runtime improvements ranging from $33.6\times$ to $523.6\times$ over state-of-the-art heuristic samplers. We demonstrate the superior performance of our sampling method through an extensive evaluation on $60$ instances from a public domain benchmark suite utilized in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Centrally Coordinated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Power Grid Topology Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power grid operation is becoming more complex due to the increase in generation of renewable energy. The recent series of Learning To Run a Power Network (L2RPN) competitions have encouraged the use of artificial agents to assist human dispatchers in operating power grids. However, the combinatorial nature of the action space poses a challenge to both conventional optimizers and learned controllers. Action space factorization, which breaks down decision-making into smaller sub-tasks, is one approach to tackle the curse of dimensionality. In this study, we propose a centrally coordinated multi-agent (CCMA) architecture for action space factorization. In this approach, regional agents propose actions and subsequently a coordinating agent selects the final action. We investigate several implementations of the CCMA architecture, and benchmark in different experimental settings against various L2RPN baseline approaches. The CCMA architecture exhibits higher sample efficiency and superior final performance than the baseline approaches. The results suggest high potential of the CCMA approach for further application in higher-dimensional L2RPN as well as real-world power grid settings.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Nonparametric Perspective on Mahalanobis Distance for Out of Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian nonparametric methods are naturally suited to the problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, these techniques have largely been eschewed in favor of simpler methods based on distances between pre-trained or learned embeddings of data points. Here we show a formal relationship between Bayesian nonparametric models and the relative Mahalanobis distance score (RMDS), a commonly used method for OOD detection. Building on this connection, we propose Bayesian nonparametric mixture models with hierarchical priors that generalize the RMDS. We evaluate these models on the OpenOOD detection benchmark and show that Bayesian nonparametric methods can improve upon existing OOD methods, especially in regimes where training classes differ in their covariance structure and where there are relatively few data points per class.</description>

      <title>A Low-Complexity Plug-and-Play Deep Learning Model for Massive MIMO Precoding Across Sites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) technology has transformed wireless communication by enhancing spectral efficiency and network capacity. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based mMIMO precoder to tackle the complexity challenges of existing approaches, such as weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE), while leveraging meta-learning domain generalization and a teacher-student architecture to improve generalization across diverse communication environments. When deployed to a previously unseen site, the proposed model achieves excellent sum-rate performance while maintaining low computational complexity by avoiding matrix inversions and by using a simpler neural network structure. The model is trained and tested on a custom ray-tracing dataset composed of several base station locations. The experimental results indicate that our method effectively balances computational efficiency with high sum-rate performance while showcasing strong generalization performance in unseen environments. Furthermore, with fine-tuning, the proposed model outperforms WMMSE across all tested sites and SNR conditions while reducing complexity by at least 73$\times$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of deep learning (DL) models for precoding in massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems is often constrained by high computational demands and energy consumption. In this paper, we investigate the compute energy efficiency of mMIMO precoders using DL-based approaches, comparing them to conventional methods such as zero forcing and weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE). Our energy consumption model accounts for both memory access and calculation energy within DL accelerators. We propose a framework that incorporates mixed-precision quantization-aware training and neural architecture search to reduce energy usage without compromising accuracy. Using a ray-tracing dataset covering various base station sites, we analyze how site-specific conditions affect the energy efficiency of compressed models. Our results show that deep neural network compression generates precoders with up to 35 times higher energy efficiency than WMMSE at equal performance, depending on the scenario and the desired rate. These results establish a foundation and a benchmark for the development of energy-efficient DL-based mMIMO precoders.</description>

      <title>Demand Response Optimization MILP Framework for Microgrids with DERs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of renewable energy sources in microgrids introduces significant operational challenges due to their intermittent nature and the mismatch between generation and demand patterns. Effective demand response (DR) strategies are crucial for maintaining system stability and economic efficiency, particularly in microgrids with high renewable penetration. This paper presents a comprehensive mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework for optimizing DR operations in a microgrid with solar generation and battery storage systems. The framework incorporates load classification, dynamic price thresholding, and multi-period coordination for optimal DR event scheduling. Analysis across seven distinct operational scenarios demonstrates consistent peak load reduction of 10\% while achieving energy cost savings ranging from 13.1\% to 38.0\%. The highest performance was observed in scenarios with high solar generation, where the framework achieved 38.0\% energy cost reduction through optimal coordination of renewable resources and DR actions. The results validate the framework's effectiveness in managing diverse operational challenges while maintaining system stability and economic efficiency.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Mental Health: Exploring College Students' Well-being through Smartphone Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global mental health crisis is a pressing concern, with college students particularly vulnerable to rising mental health disorders. The widespread use of smartphones among young adults, while offering numerous benefits, has also been linked to negative outcomes such as addiction and regret, significantly impacting well-being. Leveraging the longest longitudinal dataset collected over four college years through passive mobile sensing, this study is the first to examine the relationship between students' smartphone unlocking behaviors and their mental health at scale in real-world settings. We provide the first evidence demonstrating the predictability of phone unlocking behaviors for mental health outcomes based on a large dataset, highlighting the potential of these novel features for future predictive models. Our findings reveal important variations in smartphone usage across genders and locations, offering a deeper understanding of the interplay between digital behaviors and mental health. We highlight future research directions aimed at mitigating adverse effects and promoting digital well-being in this population.</description>

      <title>Universal Model Routing for Efficient LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models' significant advances in capabilities are accompanied by significant increases in inference costs. Model routing is a simple technique for reducing inference cost, wherein one maintains a pool of candidate LLMs, and learns to route each prompt to the smallest feasible LLM. Existing works focus on learning a router for a fixed pool of LLMs. In this paper, we consider the problem of dynamic routing, where new, previously unobserved LLMs are available at test time. We propose a new approach to this problem that relies on representing each LLM as a feature vector, derived based on predictions on a set of representative prompts. Based on this, we detail two effective strategies, relying on cluster-based routing and a learned cluster map respectively. We prove that these strategies are estimates of a theoretically optimal routing rule, and provide an excess risk bound to quantify their errors. Experiments on a range of public benchmarks show the effectiveness of the proposed strategies in routing amongst more than 30 unseen LLMs.</description>

      <title>Exploring Test Time Adaptation for Subcortical Segmentation of the Fetal Brain in 3D Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring the growth of subcortical regions of the fetal brain in ultrasound (US) images can help identify the presence of abnormal development. Manually segmenting these regions is a challenging task, but recent work has shown that it can be automated using deep learning. However, applying pretrained models to unseen freehand US volumes often leads to a degradation of performance due to the vast differences in acquisition and alignment. In this work, we first demonstrate that test time adaptation (TTA) can be used to improve model performance in the presence of both real and simulated domain shifts. We further propose a novel TTA method by incorporating a normative atlas as a prior for anatomy. In the presence of various types of domain shifts, we benchmark the performance of different TTA methods and demonstrate the improvements brought by our proposed approach, which may further facilitate automated monitoring of fetal brain development. Our code is available at https://github.com/joshuaomolegan/TTA-for-3D-Fetal-Subcortical-Segmentation.</description>

      <title>Treatment response as a latent variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientists often need to analyze the samples in a study that responded to treatment in order to refine their hypotheses and find potential causal drivers of response. Natural variation in outcomes makes teasing apart responders from non-responders a statistical inference problem. To handle latent responses, we introduce the causal two-groups (C2G) model, a causal extension of the classical two-groups model. The C2G model posits that treated samples may or may not experience an effect, according to some prior probability. We propose two empirical Bayes procedures for the causal two-groups model, one under semi-parametric conditions and another under fully nonparametric conditions. The semi-parametric model assumes additive treatment effects and is identifiable from observed data. The nonparametric model is unidentifiable, but we show it can still be used to test for response in each treated sample. We show empirically and theoretically that both methods for selecting responders control the false discovery rate at the target level with near-optimal power. We also propose two novel estimands of interest and provide a strategy for deriving estimand intervals in the unidentifiable nonparametric model. On a cancer immunotherapy dataset, the nonparametric C2G model recovers clinically-validated predictive biomarkers of both positive and negative outcomes.

      <title>If Multi-Agent Debate is the Answer, What is the Question?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the factual accuracy and reasoning quality of large language models (LLMs) by engaging multiple agents in iterative discussions during inference. Despite its potential, we argue that current MAD research suffers from critical shortcomings in evaluation practices, including limited dataset overlap and inconsistent baselines, raising significant concerns about generalizability. Correspondingly, this paper presents a systematic evaluation of five representative MAD methods across nine benchmarks using four foundational models. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that MAD methods fail to reliably outperform simple single-agent baselines such as Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency, even when consuming additional inference-time computation. From our analysis, we found that model heterogeneity can significantly improve MAD frameworks. We propose Heter-MAD enabling a single LLM agent to access the output from heterogeneous foundation models, which boosts the performance of current MAD frameworks. Finally, we outline potential directions for advancing MAD, aiming to spark a broader conversation and inspire future work in this area.</description>

      <title>CLOVER: A Test Case Generation Benchmark with Coverage, Long-Context, and Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software testing is a critical aspect of software development, yet generating test cases remains a routine task for engineers. This paper presents a benchmark, CLOVER, to evaluate models' capabilities in generating and completing test cases under specific conditions. Spanning from simple assertion completions to writing test cases that cover specific code blocks across multiple files, these tasks are based on 12 python repositories, analyzing 845 problems with context lengths ranging from 4k to 128k tokens. Utilizing code testing frameworks, we propose a method to construct retrieval contexts using coverage information. While models exhibit comparable performance with short contexts, notable differences emerge with 16k contexts. Notably, models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 can effectively leverage relevant snippets; however, all models score below 35\% on the complex Task III, even with the oracle context provided, underscoring the benchmark's significance and the potential for model improvement. The benchmark is containerized for code execution across tasks, and we will release the code, data, and construction methodologies.</description>

      <title>InTAR: Inter-Task Auto-Reconfigurable Accelerator Design for High Data Volume Variation in DNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of deep neural networks (DNNs) has driven a boom in AI services, which results in an increased demand for computing power and memory. In modern DNNs, the data sizes produced and consumed are highly varied across operations (high data volume variation, HDV). Because existing design paradigms use fixed execution patterns that lead to either low computational efficiency due to pipeline stalls or frequent off-chip memory accesses to manage large intermediate data, HDV applications are challenging to accelerate on FPGAs. To address these challenges, we introduce the Inter-Task Auto-Reconfigurable Accelerator (InTAR), a novel accelerator design for HDV applications on FPGAs. InTAR combines the high computational efficiency of sequential execution with the reduced off-chip memory overhead of dataflow execution. It switches execution patterns automatically with a static schedule determined before circuit design based on resource constraints and model parameters. Unlike previous reconfigurable accelerators, InTAR encodes reconfiguration schedules during circuit design, allowing model-specific optimizations that allocate only the necessary logic and interconnects. Thus, InTAR achieves a high clock frequency with fewer resources and low reconfiguration time. Furthermore, InTAR supports high-level tools such as HLS for fast design generation. We implement a set of multi-task kernels in various HDV DNNs using InTAR. Compared with dataflow and sequential accelerators, InTAR exhibits $1.8\times$ and $7.1 \times$ speedups correspondingly. We also implement InTAR for GPT-2 medium as a more complex example, which achieves a speedup of $\mathbf{3.65 \sim 39.14\times}$ and a $\mathbf{1.72 \sim 10.44\times}$ boost in DSP efficiency compared to the corresponding SoTA accelerators on FPGAs.</description>

      <title>DejAIvu: Identifying and Explaining AI Art on the Web in Real-Time with Saliency Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent surge in advanced generative models, such as diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs), has led to an alarming rise in AI-generated images across various domains on the web. While such technologies offer benefits such as democratizing artistic creation, they also pose challenges in misinformation, digital forgery, and authenticity verification. Additionally, the uncredited use of AI-generated images in media and marketing has sparked significant backlash from online communities. In response to this, we introduce DejAIvu, a Chrome Web extension that combines real-time AI-generated image detection with saliency-based explainability while users browse the web. Using an ONNX-optimized deep learning model, DejAIvu automatically analyzes images on websites such as Google Images, identifies AI-generated content using model inference, and overlays a saliency heatmap to highlight AI-related artifacts. Our approach integrates efficient in-browser inference, gradient-based saliency analysis, and a seamless user experience, ensuring that AI detection is both transparent and interpretable. We also evaluate DejAIvu across multiple pretrained architectures and benchmark datasets, demonstrating high accuracy and low latency, making it a practical and deployable tool for enhancing AI image accountability. The code for this system can be found at https://github.com/Noodulz/dejAIvu.</description>

      <title>Data Sensor Fusion In Digital Twin Technology For Enhanced Capabilities In A Home Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of data sensor fusion in digital twin technology to bolster home environment capabilities, particularly in the context of challenges brought on by the coronavirus pandemic and its economic effects. The study underscores the crucial role of digital transformation in not just adapting to, but also mitigating disruptions during the fourth industrial revolution. Using the Wit Motion sensor, data was collected for activities such as walking, working, sitting, and lying, with sensors measuring accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. The research integrates Cyber-physical systems, IoT, AI, and robotics to fortify digital twin capabilities.
  The paper compares sensor fusion methods, including feature-level fusion, decision-level fusion, and Kalman filter fusion, alongside machine learning models like SVM, GBoost, and Random Forest to assess model effectiveness. Results show that sensor fusion significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of these models, as it compensates for individual sensor weaknesses, particularly with magnetometers. Despite higher accuracy in ideal conditions, integrating data from multiple sensors ensures more consistent and reliable results in real-world settings, thereby establishing a robust system that can be confidently applied in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>InfiniteHiP: Extending Language Model Context Up to 3 Million Tokens on a Single GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern large language models (LLMs), handling very long context lengths presents significant challenges as it causes slower inference speeds and increased memory costs. Additionally, most existing pre-trained LLMs fail to generalize beyond their original training sequence lengths. To enable efficient and practical long-context utilization, we introduce InfiniteHiP, a novel, and practical LLM inference framework that accelerates processing by dynamically eliminating irrelevant context tokens through a modular hierarchical token pruning algorithm. Our method also allows generalization to longer sequences by selectively applying various RoPE adjustment methods according to the internal attention patterns within LLMs. Furthermore, we offload the key-value cache to host memory during inference, significantly reducing GPU memory pressure. As a result, InfiniteHiP enables the processing of up to 3 million tokens on a single L40s 48GB GPU -- 3x larger -- without any permanent loss of context information. Our framework achieves an 18.95x speedup in attention decoding for a 1 million token context without requiring additional training. We implement our method in the SGLang framework and demonstrate its effectiveness and practicality through extensive evaluations.</description>

      <title>CopySpec: Accelerating LLMs with Speculative Copy-and-Paste Without Compromising Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce CopySpec, an innovative technique designed to tackle the inefficiencies LLMs face when generating responses that closely resemble previous outputs. CopySpec identifies repeated sequences in the model's chat history and speculates that the same tokens will follow, enabling seamless copying without compromising output quality or requiring additional GPU memory. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted experiments using five LLMs and five datasets: MT-Bench, CNN/DM, GSM-8K, HumanEval, and our newly created dataset, MT-Redundant. MT-Redundant, introduced in this paper, transforms the second turn of MT-Bench into a request for variations of the first turn's answer, simulating real-world scenarios where users request modifications to prior responses. Our results demonstrate significant speed-ups: up to 2.35x on CNN/DM, 3.08x on the second turn of select MT-Redundant categories, and 2.66x on the third turn of GSM-8K's self-correction tasks. Moreover, we show that CopySpec integrates seamlessly with speculative decoding, yielding an average 49% additional speed-up over speculative decoding for the second turn of MT-Redundant across all eight categories. While LLMs, even with speculative decoding, suffer from slower inference as context sizes grow, CopySpec leverages the expanded context to accelerate inference, making it faster as the context size increases. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/RazvanDu/CopySpec.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Why Data Augmentation Improves Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data augmentation is a cornerstone technique in deep learning, widely used to improve model generalization. Traditional methods like random cropping and color jittering, as well as advanced techniques such as CutOut, Mixup, and CutMix, have achieved notable success across various domains. However, the mechanisms by which data augmentation improves generalization remain poorly understood, and existing theoretical analyses typically focus on individual techniques without a unified explanation. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework that elucidates how data augmentation enhances generalization through two key effects: partial semantic feature removal and feature mixing. Partial semantic feature removal reduces the model's reliance on individual feature, promoting diverse feature learning and better generalization. Feature mixing, by scaling down original semantic features and introducing noise, increases training complexity, driving the model to develop more robust features. Advanced methods like CutMix integrate both effects, achieving complementary benefits. Our theoretical insights are further supported by experimental results, validating the effectiveness of this unified perspective.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Singular: The Essential Role of Multiple Generations in Effective Benchmark Evaluation and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant utilities in real-world applications, exhibiting impressive capabilities in natural language processing and understanding. Benchmark evaluations are crucial for assessing the capabilities of LLMs as they can provide a comprehensive assessment of their strengths and weaknesses. However, current evaluation methods often overlook the inherent randomness of LLMs by employing deterministic generation strategies or relying on a single random sample, resulting in unaccounted sampling variance and unreliable benchmark score estimates. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical statistical model that provides a more comprehensive representation of the benchmarking process by incorporating both benchmark characteristics and LLM randomness. We show that leveraging multiple generations improves the accuracy of estimating the benchmark score and reduces variance. We also introduce $\mathbb P\left(\text{correct}\right)$, a prompt-level difficulty score based on correct ratios, providing fine-grained insights into individual prompts. Additionally, we create a data map that visualizes difficulty and semantic prompts, enabling error detection and quality control in benchmark construction.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Parrot on LLM's Shoulder: A Summative Assessment of Physical Concept Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a systematic way, we investigate a widely asked question: Do LLMs really understand what they say?, which relates to the more familiar term Stochastic Parrot. To this end, we propose a summative assessment over a carefully designed physical concept understanding task, PhysiCo. Our task alleviates the memorization issue via the usage of grid-format inputs that abstractly describe physical phenomena. The grids represents varying levels of understanding, from the core phenomenon, application examples to analogies to other abstract patterns in the grid world. A comprehensive study on our task demonstrates: (1) state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, o1 and Gemini 2.0 flash thinking, lag behind humans by ~40%; (2) the stochastic parrot phenomenon is present in LLMs, as they fail on our grid task but can describe and recognize the same concepts well in natural language; (3) our task challenges the LLMs due to intrinsic difficulties rather than the unfamiliar grid format, as in-context learning and fine-tuning on same formatted data added little to their performance.</description>

      <title>Integrated Optimization and Game Theory Framework for Fair Cost Allocation in Community Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fair cost allocation in community microgrids remains a significant challenge due to the complex interactions between multiple participants with varying load profiles, distributed energy resources, and storage systems. Traditional cost allocation methods often fail to adequately address the dynamic nature of participant contributions and benefits, leading to inequitable distribution of costs and reduced participant satisfaction. This paper presents a novel framework integrating multi-objective optimization with cooperative game theory for fair and efficient microgrid operation and cost allocation. The proposed approach combines mixed-integer linear programming for optimal resource dispatch with Shapley value analysis for equitable benefit distribution, ensuring both system efficiency and participant satisfaction. The framework was validated using real-world data across six distinct operational scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both technical and economic performance. Results show peak demand reductions ranging from 7.8% to 62.6%, solar utilization rates reaching 114.8% through effective storage integration, and cooperative gains of up to $1,801.01 per day. The Shapley value-based allocation achieved balanced benefit-cost distributions, with net positions ranging from -16.0% to +14.2% across different load categories, ensuring sustainable participant cooperation.</description>

      <title>SkyRover: A Modular Simulator for Cross-Domain Pathfinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) increasingly collaborate in logistics, surveillance, inspection tasks and etc. However, existing simulators often focus on a single domain, limiting cross-domain study. This paper presents the SkyRover, a modular simulator for UAV-AGV multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF). SkyRover supports realistic agent dynamics, configurable 3D environments, and convenient APIs for external solvers and learning methods. By unifying ground and aerial operations, it facilitates cross-domain algorithm design, testing, and benchmarking. Experiments highlight SkyRover's capacity for efficient pathfinding and high-fidelity simulations in UAV-AGV coordination.

      <title>Off-Policy Evaluation for Recommendations with Missing-Not-At-Random Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unbiased recommender learning (URL) and off-policy evaluation/learning (OPE/L) techniques are effective in addressing the data bias caused by display position and logging policies, thereby consistently improving the performance of recommendations. However, when both bias exits in the logged data, these estimators may suffer from significant bias. In this study, we first analyze the position bias of the OPE estimator when rewards are missing not at random. To mitigate both biases, we propose a novel estimator that leverages two probabilities of logging policies and reward observations as propensity scores. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed estimator achieves superior performance compared to other estimators, even as the levels of bias in reward observations increases.</description>

      <title>Residual Transformer Fusion Network for Salt and Pepper Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been widely used in unstructured datasets, one of which is image denoising. Image denoising is a noisy image reconstruction process that aims to reduce additional noise that occurs from the noisy image with various strategies. Image denoising has a problem, namely that some image denoising methods require some prior knowledge of information about noise. To overcome this problem, a combined architecture of Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) and Residual Networks (ResNet) is used which is called the Residual Transformer Fusion Network (RTF-Net). In general, the process in this architecture can be divided into two parts, Noise Suppression Network (NSN) and Structure Enhancement Network (SEN). Residual Block is used in the Noise Suppression Network and is used to learn the noise map in the image, while the CvT is used in the Structure Enhancement Network and is used to learn the details that need to be added to the image processed by the Noise Suppression Network. The model was trained using the DIV2K Training Set dataset, and validation using the DIV2K Validation Set. After doing the training, the model was tested using Lena, Bridge, Pepper, and BSD300 images with noise levels ranging from 30%, 50%, and 70% and the PSNR results were compared with the DBA, NASNLM, PARIGI, NLSF, NLSF-MLP and NLSF-CNN methods. The test results show that the proposed method is superior in all cases except for Pepper's image with a noise level of 30%, where NLSF-CNN is superior with a PSNR value of 32.99 dB, while the proposed method gets a PSNR value of 31.70 dB.</description>

      <title>Hope vs. Hate: Understanding User Interactions with LGBTQ+ News Content in Mainstream US News Media through the Lens of Hope Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper makes three contributions. First, via a substantial corpus of 1,419,047 comments posted on 3,161 YouTube news videos of major US cable news outlets, we analyze how users engage with LGBTQ+ news content. Our analyses focus both on positive and negative content. In particular, we construct a fine-grained hope speech classifier that detects positive (hope speech), negative, neutral, and irrelevant content. Second, in consultation with a public health expert specializing on LGBTQ+ health, we conduct an annotation study with a balanced and diverse political representation and release a dataset of 3,750 instances with fine-grained labels and detailed annotator demographic information. Finally, beyond providing a vital resource for the LGBTQ+ community, our annotation study and subsequent in-the-wild assessments reveal (1) strong association between rater political beliefs and how they rate content relevant to a marginalized community; (2) models trained on individual political beliefs exhibit considerable in-the-wild disagreement; and (3) zero-shot large language models (LLMs) align more with liberal raters.</description>

      <title>Diversity Enhances an LLM's Performance in RAG and Long-context Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the challenge of context window limitations, primarily due to the quadratic time complexity of the self-attention mechanism (\(O(N^2)\), where \(N\) denotes the context window length). This constraint impacts tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (Q\&amp;A) and long context summarization. A common approach involves selecting content with the highest similarity to the query; however, this often leads to redundancy and the exclusion of diverse yet relevant information. Building on principles from Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), we integrate diversity into the content selection process. Our findings reveal that incorporating diversity substantially increases the recall of selecting relevant sentences or chunks before LLM-based Q\&amp;A and summarization. These results highlight the importance of maintaining diversity in future LLM applications to further improve summarization and Q\&amp;A outcomes.</description>

      <title>Criteria-Aware Graph Filtering: Extremely Fast Yet Accurate Multi-Criteria Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-criteria (MC) recommender systems, which utilize MC rating information for recommendation, are increasingly widespread in various e-commerce domains. However, the MC recommendation using training-based collaborative filtering, requiring consideration of multiple ratings compared to single-criterion counterparts, often poses practical challenges in achieving state-of-the-art performance along with scalable model training. To solve this problem, we propose CA-GF, a training-free MC recommendation method, which is built upon criteria-aware graph filtering for efficient yet accurate MC recommendations. Specifically, first, we construct an item-item similarity graph using an MC user-expansion graph. Next, we design CA-GF composed of the following key components, including 1) criterion-specific graph filtering where the optimal filter for each criterion is found using various types of polynomial low-pass filters and 2) criteria preference-infused aggregation where the smoothed signals from each criterion are aggregated. We demonstrate that CA-GF is (a) efficient: providing the computational efficiency, offering the extremely fast runtime of less than 0.2 seconds even on the largest benchmark dataset, (b) accurate: outperforming benchmark MC recommendation methods, achieving substantial accuracy gains up to 24% compared to the best competitor, and (c) interpretable: providing interpretations for the contribution of each criterion to the model prediction based on visualizations.</description>

      <title>Optimal Algorithms in Linear Regression under Covariate Shift: On the Importance of Precondition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common pursuit in modern statistical learning is to attain satisfactory generalization out of the source data distribution (OOD). In theory, the challenge remains unsolved even under the canonical setting of covariate shift for the linear model. This paper studies the foundational (high-dimensional) linear regression where the ground truth variables are confined to an ellipse-shape constraint and addresses two fundamental questions in this regime: (i) given the target covariate matrix, what is the min-max \emph{optimal} algorithm under covariate shift? (ii) for what kinds of target classes, the commonly-used SGD-type algorithms achieve optimality? Our analysis starts with establishing a tight lower generalization bound via a Bayesian Cramer-Rao inequality. For (i), we prove that the optimal estimator can be simply a certain linear transformation of the best estimator for the source distribution. Given the source and target matrices, we show that the transformation can be efficiently computed via a convex program. The min-max optimal analysis for SGD leverages the idea that we recognize both the accumulated updates of the applied algorithms and the ideal transformation as preconditions on the learning variables. We provide sufficient conditions when SGD with its acceleration variants attain optimality.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Member-Group Relations via Multi-View Graph Filtering for Effective Group Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group recommendation aims at providing optimized recommendations tailored to diverse groups, enabling groups to enjoy appropriate items. On the other hand, most existing group recommendation methods are built upon deep neural network (DNN) architectures designed to capture the intricate relationships between member-level and group-level interactions. While these DNN-based approaches have proven their effectiveness, they require complex and expensive training procedures to incorporate group-level interactions in addition to member-level interactions. To overcome such limitations, we introduce Group-GF, a new approach for extremely fast recommendations of items to each group via multi-view graph filtering (GF) that offers a holistic view of complex member-group dynamics, without the need for costly model training. Specifically, in Group-GF, we first construct three item similarity graphs manifesting different viewpoints for GF. Then, we discover a distinct polynomial graph filter for each similarity graph and judiciously aggregate the three graph filters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Group-GF in terms of significantly reducing runtime and achieving state-of-the-art recommendation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Game Theory Meets Large Language Models: A Systematic Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Game theory establishes a fundamental framework for analyzing strategic interactions among rational decision-makers. The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has sparked extensive research exploring the intersection of these two fields. Specifically, game-theoretic methods are being applied to evaluate and enhance LLM capabilities, while LLMs themselves are reshaping classic game models. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the intersection of these fields, exploring a bidirectional relationship from three perspectives: (1) Establishing standardized game-based benchmarks for evaluating LLM behavior; (2) Leveraging game-theoretic methods to improve LLM performance through algorithmic innovations; (3) Characterizing the societal impacts of LLMs through game modeling. Among these three aspects, we also highlight how the equilibrium analysis for traditional game models is impacted by LLMs' advanced language understanding, which in turn extends the study of game theory. Finally, we identify key challenges and future research directions, assessing their feasibility based on the current state of the field. By bridging theoretical rigor with emerging AI capabilities, this survey aims to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and drive progress in this evolving research area.</description>

      <title>CRANE: Reasoning with constrained LLM generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code generation, symbolic math reasoning, and other tasks require LLMs to produce outputs that are both syntactically and semantically correct. Constrained LLM generation is a promising direction to enforce adherence to formal grammar, but prior works have empirically observed that strict enforcement of formal constraints often diminishes the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In this work, we first provide a theoretical explanation for why constraining LLM outputs to very restrictive grammars that only allow syntactically valid final answers reduces the reasoning capabilities of the model. Second, we demonstrate that by augmenting the output grammar with carefully designed additional rules, it is always possible to preserve the reasoning capabilities of the LLM while ensuring syntactic and semantic correctness in its outputs. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose a reasoning-augmented constrained decoding algorithm, CRANE, which effectively balances the correctness of constrained generation with the flexibility of unconstrained generation. Experiments on multiple open-source LLMs and benchmarks show that CRANE significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art constrained decoding strategies and standard unconstrained decoding, showing up to 10% points accuracy improvement over baselines on challenging symbolic reasoning benchmarks GSM-symbolic and FOLIO.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Cryptocurrency Unpredictability: A Comprehensive Study of Complexity and Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper offers a thorough examination of the univariate predictability in cryptocurrency time-series. By exploiting a combination of complexity measure and model predictions we explore the cryptocurrencies time-series forecasting task focusing on the exchange rate in USD of Litecoin, Binance Coin, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. On one hand, to assess the complexity and the randomness of these time-series, a comparative analysis has been performed using Brownian and colored noises as a benchmark. The results obtained from the Complexity-Entropy causality plane and power density spectrum analysis reveal that cryptocurrency time-series exhibit characteristics closely resembling those of Brownian noise when analyzed in a univariate context. On the other hand, the application of a wide range of statistical, machine and deep learning models for time-series forecasting demonstrates the low predictability of cryptocurrencies. Notably, our analysis reveals that simpler models such as Naive models consistently outperform the more complex machine and deep learning ones in terms of forecasting accuracy across different forecast horizons and time windows. The combined study of complexity and forecasting accuracies highlights the difficulty of predicting the cryptocurrency market. These findings provide valuable insights into the inherent characteristics of the cryptocurrency data and highlight the need to reassess the challenges associated with predicting cryptocurrency's price movements.</description>

      <title>Application of Tabular Transformer Architectures for Operating System Fingerprinting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operating System (OS) fingerprinting is essential for network management and cybersecurity, enabling accurate device identification based on network traffic analysis. Traditional rule-based tools such as Nmap and p0f face challenges in dynamic environments due to frequent OS updates and obfuscation techniques. While Machine Learning (ML) approaches have been explored, Deep Learning (DL) models, particularly Transformer architectures, remain unexploited in this domain. This study investigates the application of Tabular Transformer architectures-specifically TabTransformer and FT-Transformer-for OS fingerprinting, leveraging structured network data from three publicly available datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that FT-Transformer generally outperforms traditional ML models, previous approaches and TabTransformer across multiple classification levels (OS family, major, and minor versions). The results establish a strong foundation for DL-based OS fingerprinting, improving accuracy and adaptability in complex network environments. Furthermore, we ensure the reproducibility of our research by providing an open-source implementation.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Anomaly Detection on Implicit Shape representations for Sarcopenia Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sarcopenia is an age-related progressive loss of muscle mass and strength that significantly impacts daily life. A commonly studied criterion for characterizing the muscle mass has been the combination of 3D imaging and manual segmentations. In this paper, we instead study the muscles' shape. We rely on an implicit neural representation (INR) to model normal muscle shapes. We then introduce an unsupervised anomaly detection method to identify sarcopenic muscles based on the reconstruction error of the implicit model. Relying on a conditional INR with an auto-decoding strategy, we also learn a latent representation of the muscles that clearly separates normal from abnormal muscles in an unsupervised fashion. Experimental results on a dataset of 103 segmented volumes indicate that our double anomaly detection strategy effectively discriminates sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic muscles.</description>

      <title>A Novel Dialect-Aware Framework for the Classification of Arabic Dialects and Emotions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arabic is one of the oldest languages still in use today. As a result, several Arabic-speaking regions have developed dialects that are unique to them. Dialect and emotion recognition have various uses in Arabic text analysis, such as determining an online customer's origin based on their comments. Furthermore, intelligent chatbots that are aware of a user's emotions can respond appropriately to the user. Current research in emotion detection in the Arabic language lacks awareness of how emotions are exhibited in different dialects, which motivates the work found in this study. This research addresses the problems of dialect and emotion classification in Arabic. Specifically, this is achieved by building a novel framework that can identify and predict Arabic dialects and emotions from a given text. The framework consists of three modules: A text-preprocessing module, a classification module, and a clustering module with the novel capability of building new dialect-aware emotion lexicons. The proposed framework generated a new emotional lexicon for different dialects. It achieved an accuracy of 88.9% in classifying Arabic dialects, which outperforms the state-of-the-art results by 6.45 percentage points. Furthermore, the framework achieved 89.1-79% accuracy in detecting emotions in the Egyptian and Gulf dialects, respectively.</description>

      <title>Feature-based Graph Attention Networks Improve Online Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online continual learning for image classification is crucial for models to adapt to new data while retaining knowledge of previously learned tasks. This capability is essential to address real-world challenges involving dynamic environments and evolving data distributions. Traditional approaches predominantly employ Convolutional Neural Networks, which are limited to processing images as grids and primarily capture local patterns rather than relational information. Although the emergence of transformer architectures has improved the ability to capture relationships, these models often require significantly larger resources. In this paper, we present a novel online continual learning framework based on Graph Attention Networks (GATs), which effectively capture contextual relationships and dynamically update the task-specific representation via learned attention weights. Our approach utilizes a pre-trained feature extractor to convert images into graphs using hierarchical feature maps, representing information at varying levels of granularity. These graphs are then processed by a GAT and incorporate an enhanced global pooling strategy to improve classification performance for continual learning. In addition, we propose the rehearsal memory duplication technique that improves the representation of the previous tasks while maintaining the memory budget. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and MiniImageNet, demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>E-MD3C: Taming Masked Diffusion Transformers for Efficient Zero-Shot Object Customization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose E-MD3C ($\underline{E}$fficient $\underline{M}$asked $\underline{D}$iffusion Transformer with Disentangled $\underline{C}$onditions and $\underline{C}$ompact $\underline{C}$ollector), a highly efficient framework for zero-shot object image customization. Unlike prior works reliant on resource-intensive Unet architectures, our approach employs lightweight masked diffusion transformers operating on latent patches, offering significantly improved computational efficiency. The framework integrates three core components: (1) an efficient masked diffusion transformer for processing autoencoder latents, (2) a disentangled condition design that ensures compactness while preserving background alignment and fine details, and (3) a learnable Conditions Collector that consolidates multiple inputs into a compact representation for efficient denoising and learning. E-MD3C outperforms the existing approach on the VITON-HD dataset across metrics such as PSNR, FID, SSIM, and LPIPS, demonstrating clear advantages in parameters, memory efficiency, and inference speed. With only $\frac{1}{4}$ of the parameters, our Transformer-based 468M model delivers $2.5\times$ faster inference and uses $\frac{2}{3}$ of the GPU memory compared to an 1720M Unet-based latent diffusion model.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Euclidean Alignment for Transfer Learning in EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the non-stationarity and large individual differences of EEG signals, EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) usually need subject-specific calibration to tailor the decoding algorithm for each new subject, which is time-consuming and user-unfriendly, hindering their real-world applications. Transfer learning (TL) has been extensively used to expedite the calibration, by making use of EEG data from other subjects/sessions. An important consideration in TL for EEG-based BCIs is to reduce the data distribution discrepancies among different subjects/session, to avoid negative transfer. Euclidean alignment (EA) was proposed in 2020 to address this challenge. Numerous experiments from 10 different BCI paradigms demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency. This paper revisits the EA, explaining its procedure and correct usage, introducing its applications and extensions, and pointing out potential new research directions. It should be very helpful to BCI researchers, especially those who are working on EEG signal decoding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of visual question answering (VQA) where the image and query are represented by ASP programs that lack domain data.  We provide an approach that is orthogonal and complementary to existing knowledge augmentation techniques where we abduce domain relationships of image constructs from past examples. After framing the abduction problem, we provide a baseline approach, and an implementation that significantly improves the accuracy of query answering yet requires few examples.</description>

      <title>GEVRM: Goal-Expressive Video Generation Model For Robust Visual Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of embodied artificial intelligence, significant progress has been made in vision-language-action (VLA) models for general robot decision-making. However, the majority of existing VLAs fail to account for the inevitable external perturbations encountered during deployment. These perturbations introduce unforeseen state information to the VLA, resulting in inaccurate actions and consequently, a significant decline in generalization performance. The classic internal model control (IMC) principle demonstrates that a closed-loop system with an internal model that includes external input signals can accurately track the reference input and effectively offset the disturbance. We propose a novel closed-loop VLA method GEVRM that integrates the IMC principle to enhance the robustness of robot visual manipulation. The text-guided video generation model in GEVRM can generate highly expressive future visual planning goals. Simultaneously, we evaluate perturbations by simulating responses, which are called internal embeddings and optimized through prototype contrastive learning. This allows the model to implicitly infer and distinguish perturbations from the external environment. The proposed GEVRM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both standard and perturbed CALVIN benchmarks and shows significant improvements in realistic robot tasks.</description>

      <title>FE-LWS: Refined Image-Text Representations via Decoder Stacking and Fused Encodings for Remote Sensing Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing image captioning aims to generate descriptive text from remote sensing images, typically employing an encoder-decoder framework. In this setup, a convolutional neural network (CNN) extracts feature representations from the input image, which then guide the decoder in a sequence-to-sequence caption generation process. Although much research has focused on refining the decoder, the quality of image representations from the encoder remains crucial for accurate captioning. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates features from two distinct CNN based encoders, capturing complementary information to enhance caption generation. Additionally, we propose a weighted averaging technique to combine the outputs of all GRUs in the stacked decoder. Furthermore, a comparison-based beam search strategy is incorporated to refine caption selection. The results demonstrate that our fusion-based approach, along with the enhanced stacked decoder, significantly outperforms both the transformer-based state-of-the-art model and other LSTM-based baselines.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Rolling Horizon Optimization for Network-Constrained V2X Value Stacking of Electric Vehicles Under Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) coordination can provide significant benefits through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) by interacting with the grid, buildings, and other EVs. This work aims to develop a V2X value-stacking framework, including vehicle-to-building (V2B), vehicle-to-grid (V2G), and energy trading, to maximize economic benefits for residential communities while maintaining distribution voltage. This work also seeks to quantify the impact of prediction errors related to building load, renewable energy, and EV arrivals. A dynamic rolling-horizon optimization (RHO) method is employed to leverage multiple revenue streams and maximize the potential of EV coordination. To address energy uncertainties, including hourly local building load, local photovoltaic (PV) generation, and EV arrivals, this work develops a Transformer-based forecasting model named Gated Recurrent Units-Encoder-Temporal Fusion Decoder (GRU-EN-TFD). The simulation results, using real data from Australia's National Electricity Market, and the Independent System Operators in New England and New York in the US, reveal that V2X value stacking can significantly reduce energy costs. The proposed GRU-EN-TFD model outperforms the benchmark forecast model. Uncertainties in EV arrivals have a more substantial impact on value-stacking performance, highlighting the significance of its accurate forecast. This work provides new insights into the dynamic interactions among residential communities, unlocking the full potential of EV batteries.</description>

      <title>Joint Attention Mechanism Learning to Facilitate Opto-physiological Monitoring during Physical Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Opto-physiological monitoring is a non-contact technique for measuring cardiac signals, i.e., photoplethysmography (PPG). Quality PPG signals directly lead to reliable physiological readings. However, PPG signal acquisition procedures are often accompanied by spurious motion artefacts (MAs), especially during low-to-high-intensity physical activity. This study proposes a practical adversarial learning approach for opto-physiological monitoring by using a generative adversarial network with an attention mechanism (AM-GAN) to model motion noise and to allow MA removal. The AM-GAN learns an MA-resistant mapping from raw and noisy signals to clear PPG signals in an adversarial manner, guided by an attention mechanism to directly translate the motion reference of triaxial acceleration to the MAs appearing in the raw signal. The AM-GAN was experimented with three various protocols engaged with 39 subjects in various physical activities. The average absolute error for heart rate (HR) derived from the MA-free PPG signal via the AM-GAN, is 1.81 beats/min for the IEEE-SPC dataset and 3.86 beats/min for the PPGDalia dataset. The same procedure applied to an in-house LU dataset resulted in average absolute errors for HR and respiratory rate (RR) of less than 1.37 beats/min and 2.49 breaths/min, respectively. The study demonstrates the robustness and resilience of AM-GAN, particularly during low-to-high-intensity physical activities.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic Analysis of Diffusion Annealed Langevin Monte Carlo for Generative Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the theoretical properties of general diffusion (interpolation) paths and their Langevin Monte Carlo implementation, referred to as diffusion annealed Langevin Monte Carlo (DALMC), under weak conditions on the data distribution. Specifically, we analyse and provide non-asymptotic error bounds for the annealed Langevin dynamics where the path of distributions is defined as Gaussian convolutions of the data distribution as in diffusion models. We then extend our results to recently proposed heavy-tailed (Student's t) diffusion paths, demonstrating their theoretical properties for heavy-tailed data distributions for the first time. Our analysis provides theoretical guarantees for a class of score-based generative models that interpolate between a simple distribution (Gaussian or Student's t) and the data distribution in finite time. This approach offers a broader perspective compared to standard score-based diffusion approaches, which are typically based on a forward Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noising process.</description>

      <title>Bridging Jensen Gap for Max-Min Group Fairness Optimization in Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group max-min fairness (MMF) is commonly used in fairness-aware recommender systems (RS) as an optimization objective, as it aims to protect marginalized item groups and ensures a fair competition platform. However, our theoretical analysis indicates that integrating MMF constraint violates the assumption of sample independence during optimization, causing the loss function to deviate from linear additivity. Such nonlinearity property introduces the Jensen gap between the model's convergence point and the optimal point if mini-batch sampling is applied. Both theoretical and empirical studies show that as the mini-batch size decreases and the group size increases, the Jensen gap will widen accordingly. Some methods using heuristic re-weighting or debiasing strategies have the potential to bridge the Jensen gap. However, they either lack theoretical guarantees or suffer from heavy computational costs. To overcome these limitations, we first theoretically demonstrate that the MMF-constrained objective can be essentially reformulated as a group-weighted optimization objective. Then we present an efficient and effective algorithm named FairDual, which utilizes a dual optimization technique to minimize the Jensen gap. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that FairDual can achieve a sub-linear convergence rate to the globally optimal solution and the Jensen gap can be well bounded under a mini-batch sampling strategy with random shuffle. Extensive experiments conducted using six large-scale RS backbone models on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that FairDual outperforms all baselines in terms of both accuracy and fairness. Our data and codes are shared at https://github.com/XuChen0427/FairDual.</description>

      <title>SQuARE: Sequential Question Answering Reasoning Engine for Enhanced Chain-of-Thought in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) are tasked with increasingly complex reasoning challenges. Traditional methods like chain-of-thought prompting have shown promise but often fall short in fully leveraging a model's reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces SQuARE (Sequential Question Answering Reasoning Engine), a novel prompting technique designed to improve reasoning through a self-interrogation paradigm. Building upon CoT frameworks, SQuARE prompts models to generate and resolve multiple auxiliary questions before tackling the main query, promoting a more thorough exploration of various aspects of a topic. Our expansive evaluations, conducted with Llama 3 and GPT-4o models across multiple question-answering datasets, demonstrate that SQuARE significantly surpasses traditional CoT prompts and existing rephrase-and-respond methods. By systematically decomposing queries, SQuARE advances LLM capabilities in reasoning tasks. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/IntelLabs/RAG-FiT/tree/square.</description>

      <title>Robot Pouring: Identifying Causes of Spillage and Selecting Alternative Action Parameters Using Probabilistic Actual Causation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In everyday life, we perform tasks (e.g., cooking or cleaning) that involve a large variety of objects and goals. When confronted with an unexpected or unwanted outcome, we take corrective actions and try again until achieving the desired result. The reasoning performed to identify a cause of the observed outcome and to select an appropriate corrective action is a crucial aspect of human reasoning for successful task execution. Central to this reasoning is the assumption that a factor is responsible for producing the observed outcome. In this paper, we investigate the use of probabilistic actual causation to determine whether a factor is the cause of an observed undesired outcome. Furthermore, we show how the actual causation probabilities can be used to find alternative actions to change the outcome. We apply the probabilistic actual causation analysis to a robot pouring task. When spillage occurs, the analysis indicates whether a task parameter is the cause and how it should be changed to avoid spillage. The analysis requires a causal graph of the task and the corresponding conditional probability distributions. To fulfill these requirements, we perform a complete causal modeling procedure (i.e., task analysis, definition of variables, determination of the causal graph structure, and estimation of conditional probability distributions) using data from a realistic simulation of the robot pouring task, covering a large combinatorial space of task parameters. Based on the results, we discuss the implications of the variables' representation and how the alternative actions suggested by the actual causation analysis would compare to the alternative solutions proposed by a human observer. The practical use of the analysis of probabilistic actual causation to select alternative action parameters is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>On multi-token prediction for efficient LLM inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate multi-token prediction (MTP) capabilities within LLMs pre-trained for next-token prediction (NTP). We first show that such models inherently possess MTP capabilities via numerical marginalization over intermediate token probabilities, though performance is data-dependent and improves with model scale. Furthermore, we explore the challenges of integrating MTP heads into frozen LLMs and find that their hidden layers are strongly specialized for NTP, making adaptation non-trivial. Finally, we show that while joint training of MTP heads with the backbone improves performance, it cannot fully overcome this barrier, prompting further research in this direction. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of MTP applied to pretrained LLMs, informing strategies for accelerating inference through parallel token prediction.</description>

      <title>Dual Formulation for Non-Rectangular Lp Robust Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs) with non-rectangular uncertainty sets, which capture interdependencies across states unlike traditional rectangular models. While non-rectangular robust policy evaluation is generally NP-hard, even in approximation, we identify a powerful class of $L_p$-bounded uncertainty sets that avoid these complexity barriers due to their structural simplicity. We further show that this class can be decomposed into infinitely many \texttt{sa}-rectangular $L_p$-bounded sets and leverage its structural properties to derive a novel dual formulation for $L_p$ RMDPs. This formulation provides key insights into the adversary's strategy and enables the development of the first robust policy evaluation algorithms for non-rectangular RMDPs. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms brute-force methods, establishing a promising foundation for future investigation into non-rectangular robust MDPs.</description>

      <title>A Differentiable Rank-Based Objective For Better Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we leverage existing statistical methods to better understand feature learning from data. We tackle this by modifying the model-free variable selection method, Feature Ordering by Conditional Independence (FOCI), which is introduced in \cite{azadkia2021simple}. While FOCI is based on a non-parametric coefficient of conditional dependence, we introduce its parametric, differentiable approximation. With this approximate coefficient of correlation, we present a new algorithm called difFOCI, which is applicable to a wider range of machine learning problems thanks to its differentiable nature and learnable parameters. We present difFOCI in three contexts: (1) as a variable selection method with baseline comparisons to FOCI, (2) as a trainable model parametrized with a neural network, and (3) as a generic, widely applicable neural network regularizer, one that improves feature learning with better management of spurious correlations. We evaluate difFOCI on increasingly complex problems ranging from basic variable selection in toy examples to saliency map comparisons in convolutional networks. We then show how difFOCI can be incorporated in the context of fairness to facilitate classifications without relying on sensitive data.</description>

      <title>DiffRenderGAN: Addressing Training Data Scarcity in Deep Segmentation Networks for Quantitative Nanomaterial Analysis through Differentiable Rendering and Generative Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanomaterials exhibit distinctive properties governed by parameters such as size, shape, and surface characteristics, which critically influence their applications and interactions across technological, biological, and environmental contexts. Accurate quantification and understanding of these materials are essential for advancing research and innovation. In this regard, deep learning segmentation networks have emerged as powerful tools that enable automated insights and replace subjective methods with precise quantitative analysis. However, their efficacy depends on representative annotated datasets, which are challenging to obtain due to the costly imaging of nanoparticles and the labor-intensive nature of manual annotations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DiffRenderGAN, a novel generative model designed to produce annotated synthetic data. By integrating a differentiable renderer into a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, DiffRenderGAN optimizes textural rendering parameters to generate realistic, annotated nanoparticle images from non-annotated real microscopy images. This approach reduces the need for manual intervention and enhances segmentation performance compared to existing synthetic data methods by generating diverse and realistic data. Tested on multiple ion and electron microscopy cases, including titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$), silicon dioxide (SiO$_2$)), and silver nanowires (AgNW), DiffRenderGAN bridges the gap between synthetic and real data, advancing the quantification and understanding of complex nanomaterial systems.</description>

      <title>Assessing Generative AI value in a public sector context: evidence from a field experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Generative AI (Gen AI) has motivated an interest in understanding how it could be used to enhance productivity across various tasks. We add to research results for the performance impact of Gen AI on complex knowledge-based tasks in a public sector setting. In a pre-registered experiment, after establishing a baseline level of performance, we find mixed evidence for two types of composite tasks related to document understanding and data analysis. For the Documents task, the treatment group using Gen AI had a 17% improvement in answer quality scores (as judged by human evaluators) and a 34% improvement in task completion time compared to a control group. For the Data task, we find the Gen AI treatment group experienced a 12% reduction in quality scores and no significant difference in mean completion time compared to the control group. These results suggest that the benefits of Gen AI may be task and potentially respondent dependent. We also discuss field notes and lessons learned, as well as supplementary insights from a post-trial survey and feedback workshop with participants.</description>

      <title>Objective quantification of mood states using large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotional states influence human behaviour and cognition, leading to diverse thought trajectories. Similarly, Large Language Models (LLMs) showcase an excellent level of response consistency across wide-ranging contexts (prompts). We leverage these parallels to establish a framework for quantifying mental states. Our approach utilises self-report questionnaires that reliably assess these states due to their inherent sensitivity to patterns of co-occurring responses. Specifically, we recruited a large sample of participants (N=422) to investigate how well an LLM (Mistral-7B-OpenOrca) quantifies a heterogenous set of depressive mood states measured with participants' open-ended responses to a depression questionnaire. We show LLM responses to held-out multiple-choice questions, given participants' open-ended answers, correlate strongly (r: 0.52-0.84) with true questionnaire scores, demonstrating LLM's generalisation from mood representations. We explore a link between these representations and factor analysis. Using ridge regression, we find depression-related subspaces within LLM hidden states. We show these subspaces to be predictive of participants' "Depression" and "Somatic &amp; Emotional Distress" factor scores, as well as suicidality severity. Overall, LLMs can provide quantitative measures of mental states. The reliability of these hinges upon how informative the questions we ask participants are. Used correctly, this approach could supplement mental state assessment in a variety of settings.</description>

Abstract: We present a machine-learning-based workflow to model an unbinned likelihood from its samples. A key advancement over existing approaches is the validation of the learned likelihood using rigorous statistical tests of the joint distribution, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the joint distribution. Our method enables the reliable communication of experimental and phenomenological likelihoods for subsequent analyses. We demonstrate its effectiveness through three case studies in high-energy physics. To support broader adoption, we provide an open-source reference implementation, nabu.</description>

      <title>Cracking the Code: Enhancing Development finance understanding with artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing development projects is crucial for understanding donors aid strategies, recipients priorities, and to assess development finance capacity to adress development issues by on-the-ground actions. In this area, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developments (OECD) Creditor Reporting System (CRS) dataset is a reference data source. This dataset provides a vast collection of project narratives from various sectors (approximately 5 million projects). While the OECD CRS provides a rich source of information on development strategies, it falls short in informing project purposes due to its reporting process based on donors self-declared main objectives and pre-defined industrial sectors. This research employs a novel approach that combines Machine Learning (ML) techniques, specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP), an innovative Python topic modeling technique called BERTopic, to categorise (cluster) and label development projects based on their narrative descriptions. By revealing existing yet hidden topics of development finance, this application of artificial intelligence enables a better understanding of donor priorities and overall development funding and provides methods to analyse public and private projects narratives.</description>

      <title>Fast Tensor Completion via Approximate Richardson Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study tensor completion (TC) through the lens of low-rank tensor decomposition (TD). Many TD algorithms use fast alternating minimization methods, which solve highly structured linear regression problems at each step (e.g., for CP, Tucker, and tensor-train decompositions). However, such algebraic structure is lost in TC regression problems, making direct extensions unclear. To address this, we propose a lifting approach that approximately solves TC regression problems using structured TD regression algorithms as blackbox subroutines, enabling sublinear-time methods. We theoretically analyze the convergence rate of our approximate Richardson iteration based algorithm, and we demonstrate on real-world tensors that its running time can be 100x faster than direct methods for CP completion.</description>

      <title>SyntheticPop: Attacking Speaker Verification Systems With Synthetic VoicePops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice Authentication (VA), also known as Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV), is a widely adopted authentication method, particularly in automated systems like banking services, where it serves as a secondary layer of user authentication. Despite its popularity, VA systems are vulnerable to various attacks, including replay, impersonation, and the emerging threat of deepfake audio that mimics the voice of legitimate users. To mitigate these risks, several defense mechanisms have been proposed. One such solution, Voice Pops, aims to distinguish an individual's unique phoneme pronunciations during the enrollment process. While promising, the effectiveness of VA+VoicePop against a broader range of attacks, particularly logical or adversarial attacks, remains insufficiently explored. We propose a novel attack method, which we refer to as SyntheticPop, designed to target the phoneme recognition capabilities of the VA+VoicePop system. The SyntheticPop attack involves embedding synthetic "pop" noises into spoofed audio samples, significantly degrading the model's performance. We achieve an attack success rate of over 95% while poisoning 20% of the training dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that VA+VoicePop achieves 69% accuracy under normal conditions, 37% accuracy when subjected to a baseline label flipping attack, and just 14% accuracy under our proposed SyntheticPop attack, emphasizing the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot generation of synthetic neurosurgical data with large language models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical data is fundamental to advance neurosurgical research, but access is often constrained by data availability, small sample sizes, privacy regulations, and resource-intensive preprocessing and de-identification procedures. Synthetic data offers a potential solution to challenges associated with accessing and using real-world data (RWD). This study aims to evaluate the capability of zero-shot generation of synthetic neurosurgical data with a large language model (LLM), GPT-4o, by benchmarking with the conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN). Synthetic datasets were compared to real-world neurosurgical data to assess fidelity (means, proportions, distributions, and bivariate correlations), utility (ML classifier performance on RWD), and privacy (duplication of records from RWD). The GPT-4o-generated datasets matched or exceeded CTGAN performance, despite no fine-tuning or access to RWD for pre-training. Datasets demonstrated high univariate and bivariate fidelity to RWD without directly exposing any real patient records, even at amplified sample size. Training an ML classifier on GPT-4o-generated data and testing on RWD for a binary prediction task showed an F1 score (0.706) with comparable performance to training on the CTGAN data (0.705) for predicting postoperative functional status deterioration. GPT-4o demonstrated a promising ability to generate high-fidelity synthetic neurosurgical data. These findings also indicate that data synthesized with GPT-4o can effectively augment clinical data with small sample sizes, and train ML models for prediction of neurosurgical outcomes. Further investigation is necessary to improve the preservation of distributional characteristics and boost classifier performance.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we tackle industry challenges in video content classification by exploring and optimizing GPT-based models for zero-shot classification across seven critical categories of video quality. We contribute a novel approach to improving GPT's performance through prompt optimization and policy refinement, demonstrating that simplifying complex policies significantly reduces false negatives. Additionally, we introduce a new decomposition-aggregation-based prompt engineering technique, which outperforms traditional single-prompt methods. These experiments, conducted on real industry problems, show that thoughtful prompt design can substantially enhance GPT's performance without additional finetuning, offering an effective and scalable solution for improving video classification systems across various domains in industry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SelfCite, a novel self-supervised approach that aligns LLMs to generate high-quality, fine-grained, sentence-level citations for the statements in their generated responses. Instead of only relying on costly and labor-intensive annotations, SelfCite leverages a reward signal provided by the LLM itself through context ablation: If a citation is necessary, removing the cited text from the context should prevent the same response; if sufficient, retaining the cited text alone should preserve the same response. This reward can guide the inference-time best-of-N sampling strategy to improve citation quality significantly, as well as be used in preference optimization to directly fine-tune the models for generating better citations. The effectiveness of SelfCite is demonstrated by increasing citation F1 up to 5.3 points on the LongBench-Cite benchmark across five long-form question answering tasks.</description>

      <title>Human-LLM Coevolution: Evidence from Academic Writing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With a statistical analysis of arXiv paper abstracts, we report a marked drop in the frequency of several words previously identified as overused by ChatGPT, such as "delve", starting soon after they were pointed out in early 2024. The frequency of certain other words favored by ChatGPT, such as "significant", has instead kept increasing. These phenomena suggest that some authors of academic papers have adapted their use of large language models (LLMs), for example, by selecting outputs or applying modifications to the LLM-generated content. Such coevolution and cooperation of humans and LLMs thus introduce additional challenges to the detection of machine-generated text in real-world scenarios. Estimating the impact of LLMs on academic writing by examining word frequency remains feasible, and more attention should be paid to words that were already frequently employed, including those that have decreased in frequency.</description>

      <title>DexTrack: Towards Generalizable Neural Tracking Control for Dexterous Manipulation from Human References</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of developing a generalizable neural tracking controller for dexterous manipulation from human references. This controller aims to manage a dexterous robot hand to manipulate diverse objects for various purposes defined by kinematic human-object interactions. Developing such a controller is complicated by the intricate contact dynamics of dexterous manipulation and the need for adaptivity, generalizability, and robustness. Current reinforcement learning and trajectory optimization methods often fall short due to their dependence on task-specific rewards or precise system models. We introduce an approach that curates large-scale successful robot tracking demonstrations, comprising pairs of human references and robot actions, to train a neural controller. Utilizing a data flywheel, we iteratively enhance the controller's performance, as well as the number and quality of successful tracking demonstrations. We exploit available tracking demonstrations and carefully integrate reinforcement learning and imitation learning to boost the controller's performance in dynamic environments. At the same time, to obtain high-quality tracking demonstrations, we individually optimize per-trajectory tracking by leveraging the learned tracking controller in a homotopy optimization method. The homotopy optimization, mimicking chain-of-thought, aids in solving challenging trajectory tracking problems to increase demonstration diversity.

      <title>Variable feature weighted fuzzy k-means algorithm for high dimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.11209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new fuzzy k-means algorithm for the clustering of high-dimensional data in various subspaces. Since high-dimensional data, some features might be irrelevant and relevant but may have different significance in the clustering process. For better clustering, it is crucial to incorporate the contribution of these features in the clustering process. To combine these features, in this paper, we have proposed a novel fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm by modifying the objective function of the fuzzy k-means using two different entropy terms. The first entropy term helps to minimize the within-cluster dispersion and maximize the negative entropy to determine clusters to contribute to the association of data points. The second entropy term helps control the weight of the features because different features have different contributing weights during the clustering to obtain a better partition. The proposed approach performance is presented in various clustering measures (AR, RI and NMI) on multiple datasets and compared with six other state-of-the-art methods. Impact Statement- In real-world applications, cluster-dependent feature weights help in partitioning the data set into more meaningful clusters. These features may be relevant, irrelevant, or redundant, but they each have different contributions during the clustering process. In this paper, a cluster-dependent feature weights approach is presented using fuzzy k-means to assign higher weights to relevant features and lower weights to irrelevant features during clustering. The method is validated using both supervised and unsupervised performance measures on real-world and synthetic datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A method of supervised learning from conflicting data with hidden contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.12113v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional supervised learning assumes a stable input-output relationship. However, this assumption fails in open-ended training settings where the input-output relationship depends on hidden contexts. In this work, we formulate a more general supervised learning problem in which training data is drawn from multiple unobservable domains, each potentially exhibiting distinct input-output maps. This inherent conflict in data renders standard empirical risk minimization training ineffective. To address this challenge, we propose a method LEAF that introduces an allocation function, which learns to assign conflicting data to different predictive models. We establish a connection between LEAF and a variant of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, allowing us to derive an analytical expression for the allocation function. Finally, we provide a theoretical analysis of LEAF and empirically validate its effectiveness on both synthetic and real-world tasks involving conflicting data.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Multi-kernel Graph Learning for Autism Prediction and Biomarker Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to its complexity, graph learning-based multi-modal integration and classification is one of the most challenging obstacles for disease prediction. To effectively offset the negative impact between modalities in the process of multi-modal integration and extract heterogeneous information from graphs, we propose a novel method called MMKGL (Multi-modal Multi-Kernel Graph Learning). For the problem of negative impact between modalities, we propose a multi-modal graph embedding module to construct a multi-modal graph. Different from conventional methods that manually construct static graphs for all modalities, each modality generates a separate graph by adaptive learning, where a function graph and a supervision graph are introduced for optimization during the multi-graph fusion embedding process. We then propose a multi-kernel graph learning module to extract heterogeneous information from the multi-modal graph. The information in the multi-modal graph at different levels is aggregated by convolutional kernels with different receptive field sizes, followed by generating a cross-kernel discovery tensor for disease prediction. Our method is evaluated on the benchmark Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, discriminative brain regions associated with autism are identified by our model, providing guidance for the study of autism pathology.</description>

      <title>What Large Language Models Know and What People Think They Know</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), become increasingly integrated into decision-making processes, the ability to trust their outputs is crucial. To earn human trust, LLMs must be well calibrated such that they can accurately assess and communicate the likelihood of their predictions being correct. Whereas recent work has focused on LLMs' internal confidence, less is understood about how effectively they convey uncertainty to users. Here we explore the calibration gap, which refers to the difference between human confidence in LLM-generated answers and the models' actual confidence, and the discrimination gap, which reflects how well humans and models can distinguish between correct and incorrect answers. Our experiments with multiple-choice and short-answer questions reveal that users tend to overestimate the accuracy of LLM responses when provided with default explanations. Moreover, longer explanations increased user confidence, even when the extra length did not improve answer accuracy. By adjusting LLM explanations to better reflect the models' internal confidence, both the calibration gap and the discrimination gap narrowed, significantly improving user perception of LLM accuracy. These findings underscore the importance of accurate uncertainty communication and highlight the effect of explanation length in influencing user trust in AI-assisted decision-making environments.

      <title>AI Oversight and Human Mistakes: Evidence from Centre Court</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Powered by the increasing predictive capabilities of machine learning algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) systems have the potential to overrule human mistakes in many settings. We provide the first field evidence that the use of AI oversight can impact human decision-making. We investigate one of the highest visibility settings where AI oversight has occurred: Hawk-Eye review of umpires in top tennis tournaments. We find that umpires lowered their overall mistake rate after the introduction of Hawk-Eye review, but also that umpires increased the rate at which they called balls in, producing a shift from making Type II errors (calling a ball out when in) to Type I errors (calling a ball in when out). We structurally estimate the psychological costs of being overruled by AI using a model of attention-constrained umpires, and our results suggest that because of these costs, umpires cared 37% more about Type II errors under AI oversight.</description>

      <title>Rendering Wireless Environments Useful for Gradient Estimators: A Zero-Order Stochastic Federated Learning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-device federated learning (FL) is a growing machine learning setting whereby multiple edge devices collaborate to train a model without disclosing their raw data. With the great number of mobile devices participating in more FL applications via the wireless environment, the practical implementation of these applications will be hindered due to the limited uplink capacity of devices, causing critical bottlenecks. In this work, we propose a novel doubly communication-efficient zero-order (ZO) method with a one-point gradient estimator that replaces communicating long vectors with scalar values and that harnesses the nature of the wireless communication channel, overcoming the need to know the channel state coefficient. It is the first method that includes the wireless channel in the learning algorithm itself instead of wasting resources to analyze it and remove its impact. We then offer a thorough analysis of the proposed zero-order federated learning (ZOFL) framework and prove that our method converges \textit{almost surely}, which is a novel result in nonconvex ZO optimization. We further prove a convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{K}})$ in the nonconvex setting. We finally demonstrate the potential of our algorithm with experimental results.</description>

      <title>Loss Landscape Degeneracy Drives Stagewise Development in Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning involves navigating a high-dimensional loss landscape over the neural network parameter space. Over the course of training, complex computational structures form and re-form inside the neural network, leading to shifts in input/output behavior. It is a priority for the science of deep learning to uncover principles governing the development of neural network structure and behavior. Drawing on the framework of singular learning theory, we propose that model development is deeply linked to degeneracy in the local geometry of the loss landscape. We investigate this link by monitoring loss landscape degeneracy throughout training, as quantified by the local learning coefficient, for a transformer language model and an in-context linear regression transformer. We show that training can be divided into distinct periods of change in loss landscape degeneracy, and that these changes in degeneracy coincide with significant changes in the internal computational structure and the input/output behavior of the transformers. This finding underscores the potential of a degeneracy-based perspective for understanding modern deep learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many practical applications of constrained optimization, scale and solving time limits make traditional optimization solvers prohibitively slow. Thus, the research question of how to design optimization proxies -- machine learning models that produce high-quality solutions -- has recently received significant attention. Orthogonal to this research thread which focuses on learning primal solutions, this paper studies how to learn dual feasible solutions that complement primal approaches and provide quality guarantees. The paper makes two distinct contributions. First, to train dual linear optimization proxies, the paper proposes a smoothed self-supervised loss function that augments the objective function with a dual penalty term. Second, the paper proposes a novel dual completion strategy that guarantees dual feasibility by solving a convex optimization problem. Moreover, the paper derives closed-form solutions to this completion optimization for several classes of dual penalties, eliminating the need for computationally-heavy implicit layers. Numerical results are presented on large linear optimization problems and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The proposed dual completion outperforms methods for learning optimization proxies which do not exploit the structure of the dual problem. Compared to commercial optimization solvers, the learned dual proxies achieve optimality gaps below $1\%$ and several orders of magnitude speedups.</description>

Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance has gained increasing interest in the machine learning community in recent years, as it allows for the comparison of measures in different metric spaces. To overcome the limitations imposed by the equal mass requirements of the classical GW problem, researchers have begun exploring its application in unbalanced settings. However, Unbalanced GW (UGW) can only be regarded as a discrepancy rather than a rigorous metric/distance between two metric measure spaces (mm-spaces). In this paper, we propose a particular case of the UGW problem, termed Partial Gromov-Wasserstein (PGW). We establish that PGW is a well-defined metric between mm-spaces and discuss its theoretical properties, including the existence of a minimizer for the PGW problem and the relationship between PGW and GW, among others. We then propose two variants of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm for solving the PGW problem and show that they are mathematically and computationally equivalent. Moreover, based on our PGW metric, we introduce the analogous concept of barycenters for mm-spaces. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our PGW metric and related solvers in applications such as shape matching, shape retrieval, and shape interpolation, comparing them against existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Interactive Symbolic Regression through Offline Reinforcement Learning: A Co-Design Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) holds great potential for uncovering underlying mathematical and physical relationships from observed data. However, the vast combinatorial space of possible expressions poses significant challenges for both online search methods and pre-trained transformer models. Additionally, current state-of-the-art approaches typically do not consider the integration of domain experts' prior knowledge and do not support iterative interactions with the model during the equation discovery process. To address these challenges, we propose the Symbolic Q-network (Sym-Q), an advanced interactive framework for large-scale symbolic regression. Unlike previous large-scale transformer-based SR approaches, Sym-Q leverages reinforcement learning without relying on a transformer-based decoder. This formulation allows the agent to learn through offline reinforcement learning using any type of tree encoder, enabling more efficient training and inference. Furthermore, we propose a co-design mechanism, where the reinforcement learning-based Sym-Q facilitates effective interaction with domain experts at any stage of the equation discovery process. Users can dynamically modify generated nodes of the expression, collaborating with the agent to tailor the mathematical expression to best fit the problem and align with the assumed physical laws, particularly when there is prior partial knowledge of the expected behavior. Our experiments demonstrate that the pre-trained Sym-Q surpasses existing SR algorithms on the challenging SSDNC benchmark. Moreover, we experimentally show on real-world cases that its performance can be further enhanced by the interactive co-design mechanism, with Sym-Q achieving greater performance gains than other state-of-the-art models. Our reproducible code is available at https://github.com/EPFL-IMOS/Sym-Q.</description>

      <title>For Better or For Worse? Learning Minimum Variance Features With Label Augmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data augmentation has been pivotal in successfully training deep learning models on classification tasks over the past decade. An important subclass of data augmentation techniques - which includes both label smoothing and Mixup - involves modifying not only the input data but also the input label during model training. In this work, we analyze the role played by the label augmentation aspect of such methods. We first prove that linear models on binary classification data trained with label augmentation learn only the minimum variance features in the data, while standard training (which includes weight decay) can learn higher variance features. We then use our techniques to show that even for nonlinear models and general data distributions, the label smoothing and Mixup losses are lower bounded by a function of the model output variance. Lastly, we demonstrate empirically that this aspect of label smoothing and Mixup can be a positive and a negative. On the one hand, we show that the strong performance of label smoothing and Mixup on image classification benchmarks is correlated with learning low variance hidden representations. On the other hand, we show that Mixup and label smoothing can be more susceptible to low variance spurious correlations in the training data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness across many tasks, but an understanding of their inductive biases and how those biases differ from other neural network architectures remains elusive. In this work, we identify the sensitivity of the model to token-wise random perturbations in the input as a unified metric which explains the inductive bias of transformers across different data modalities and distinguishes them from other architectures. We show that transformers have lower sensitivity than MLPs, CNNs, ConvMixers and LSTMs, across both vision and language tasks. We also show that this low-sensitivity bias has important implications: i) lower sensitivity correlates with improved robustness; it can also be used as an efficient intervention to further improve the robustness of transformers; ii) it corresponds to flatter minima in the loss landscape; and iii) it can serve as a progress measure for grokking. We support these findings with theoretical results showing (weak) spectral bias of transformers in the NTK regime, and improved robustness due to the lower sensitivity.

      <title>Explaining Explainability: Recommendations for Effective Use of Concept Activation Vectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concept-based explanations translate the internal representations of deep learning models into a language that humans are familiar with: concepts. One popular method for finding concepts is Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), which are learnt using a probe dataset of concept exemplars. In this work, we investigate three properties of CAVs: (1) inconsistency across layers, (2) entanglement with other concepts, and (3) spatial dependency. Each property provides both challenges and opportunities in interpreting models. We introduce tools designed to detect the presence of these properties, provide insight into how each property can lead to misleading explanations, and provide recommendations to mitigate their impact. To demonstrate practical applications, we apply our recommendations to a melanoma classification task, showing how entanglement can lead to uninterpretable results and that the choice of negative probe set can have a substantial impact on the meaning of a CAV. Further, we show that understanding these properties can be used to our advantage. For example, we introduce spatially dependent CAVs to test if a model is translation invariant with respect to a specific concept and class. Our experiments are performed on natural images (ImageNet), skin lesions (ISIC 2019), and a new synthetic dataset, Elements. Elements is designed to capture a known ground truth relationship between concepts and classes. We release this dataset to facilitate further research in understanding and evaluating interpretability methods.</description>

      <title>Predicting Safety Misbehaviours in Autonomous Driving Systems using Uncertainty Quantification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The automated real-time recognition of unexpected situations plays a crucial role in the safety of autonomous vehicles, especially in unsupported and unpredictable scenarios. This paper evaluates different Bayesian uncertainty quantification methods from the deep learning domain for the anticipatory testing of safety-critical misbehaviours during system-level simulation-based testing. Specifically, we compute uncertainty scores as the vehicle executes, following the intuition that high uncertainty scores are indicative of unsupported runtime conditions that can be used to distinguish safe from failure-inducing driving behaviors. In our study, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness and computational overhead associated with two Bayesian uncertainty quantification methods, namely MC- Dropout and Deep Ensembles, for misbehaviour avoidance. Overall, for three benchmarks from the Udacity simulator comprising both out-of-distribution and unsafe conditions introduced via mutation testing, both methods successfully detected a high number of out-of-bounds episodes providing early warnings several seconds in advance, outperforming two state-of-the-art misbehaviour prediction methods based on autoencoders and attention maps in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, Deep Ensembles detected most misbehaviours without any false alarms and did so even when employing a relatively small number of models, making them computationally feasible for real-time detection. Our findings suggest that incorporating uncertainty quantification methods is a viable approach for building fail-safe mechanisms in deep neural network-based autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>A Galois theorem for machine learning: Functions on symmetric matrices and point clouds via lightweight invariant features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a mathematical formulation for machine learning of (1) functions on symmetric matrices that are invariant with respect to the action of permutations by conjugation, and (2) functions on point clouds that are invariant with respect to rotations, reflections, and permutations of the points. To achieve this, we provide a general construction of generically separating invariant features using ideas inspired by Galois theory. We construct $O(n^2)$ invariant features derived from generators for the field of rational functions on $n\times n$ symmetric matrices that are invariant under joint permutations of rows and columns. We show that these invariant features can separate all distinct orbits of symmetric matrices except for a measure zero set; such features can be used to universally approximate invariant functions on almost all weighted graphs. For point clouds in a fixed dimension, we prove that the number of invariant features can be reduced, generically without losing expressivity, to $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of points. We combine these invariant features with DeepSets to learn functions on symmetric matrices and point clouds with varying sizes. We empirically demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on molecule property regression and point cloud distance prediction.</description>

      <title>Model-free reinforcement learning with noisy actions for automated experimental control in optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Setting up and controlling optical systems is often a challenging and tedious task. The high number of degrees of freedom to control mirrors, lenses, or phases of light makes automatic control challenging, especially when the complexity of the system cannot be adequately modeled due to noise or non-linearities. Here, we show that reinforcement learning (RL) can overcome these challenges when coupling laser light into an optical fiber, using a model-free RL approach that trains directly on the experiment without pre-training. By utilizing the sample-efficient algorithms Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) or Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), our agent learns to couple with 90% efficiency, comparable to the human expert. We demonstrate that direct training on an experiment can replace extensive system modeling. Our result exemplifies RL's potential to tackle problems in optics, paving the way for more complex applications where full noise modeling is not feasible.</description>

      <title>Port-Hamiltonian Architectural Bias for Long-Range Propagation in Deep Graph Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of information diffusion within graphs is a critical open issue that heavily influences graph representation learning, especially when considering long-range propagation. This calls for principled approaches that control and regulate the degree of propagation and dissipation of information throughout the neural flow. Motivated by this, we introduce (port-)Hamiltonian Deep Graph Networks, a novel framework that models neural information flow in graphs by building on the laws of conservation of Hamiltonian dynamical systems. We reconcile under a single theoretical and practical framework both non-dissipative long-range propagation and non-conservative behaviors, introducing tools from mechanical systems to gauge the equilibrium between the two components. Our approach can be applied to general message-passing architectures, and it provides theoretical guarantees on information conservation in time. Empirical results prove the effectiveness of our port-Hamiltonian scheme in pushing simple graph convolutional architectures to state-of-the-art performance in long-range benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Asymmetrical estimator for training encapsulated deep photonic neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18458v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic neural networks (PNNs) are fast in-propagation and high bandwidth paradigms that aim to popularize reproducible NN acceleration with higher efficiency and lower cost. However, the training of PNN is known to be challenging, where the device-to-device and system-to-system variations create imperfect knowledge of the PNN. Despite backpropagation (BP)-based training algorithms being the industry standard for their robustness, generality, and fast gradient convergence for digital training, existing PNN-BP methods rely heavily on accurate intermediate state extraction or extensive computational resources for deep PNNs (DPNNs). The truncated photonic signal propagation and the computation overhead bottleneck DPNN's operation efficiency and increase system construction cost. Here, we introduce the asymmetrical training (AsyT) method, tailored for encapsulated DPNNs, where the signal is preserved in the analogue photonic domain for the entire structure. AsyT offers a lightweight solution for DPNNs with minimum readouts, fast and energy-efficient operation, and minimum system footprint. AsyT's ease of operation, error tolerance, and generality aim to promote PNN acceleration in a widened operational scenario despite the fabrication variations and imperfect controls. We demonstrated AsyT for encapsulated DPNN with integrated photonic chips, repeatably enhancing the performance from in-silico BP for different network structures and datasets.</description>

      <title>Feature contamination: Neural networks learn uncorrelated features and fail to generalize</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning representations that generalize under distribution shifts is critical for building robust machine learning models. However, despite significant efforts in recent years, algorithmic advances in this direction have been limited. In this work, we seek to understand the fundamental difficulty of out-of-distribution generalization with deep neural networks. We first empirically show that perhaps surprisingly, even allowing a neural network to explicitly fit the representations obtained from a teacher network that can generalize out-of-distribution is insufficient for the generalization of the student network. Then, by a theoretical study of two-layer ReLU networks optimized by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) under a structured feature model, we identify a fundamental yet unexplored feature learning proclivity of neural networks, feature contamination: neural networks can learn uncorrelated features together with predictive features, resulting in generalization failure under distribution shifts. Notably, this mechanism essentially differs from the prevailing narrative in the literature that attributes the generalization failure to spurious correlations. Overall, our results offer new insights into the non-linear feature learning dynamics of neural networks and highlight the necessity of considering inductive biases in out-of-distribution generalization.</description>

      <title>Regret Bounds for Episodic Risk-Sensitive Linear Quadratic Regulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Risk-sensitive linear quadratic regulator is one of the most fundamental problems in risk-sensitive optimal control. In this paper, we study online adaptive control of risk-sensitive linear quadratic regulator in the finite horizon episodic setting. We propose a simple least-squares greedy algorithm and show that it achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\log N)$ regret under a specific identifiability assumption, where $N$ is the total number of episodes. If the identifiability assumption is not satisfied, we propose incorporating exploration noise into the least-squares-based algorithm, resulting in an algorithm with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{N})$ regret. To our best knowledge, this is the first set of regret bounds for episodic risk-sensitive linear quadratic regulator. Our proof relies on perturbation analysis of less-standard Riccati equations for risk-sensitive linear quadratic control, and a delicate analysis of the loss in the risk-sensitive performance criterion due to applying the suboptimal controller in the online learning process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread integration of Machine Learning systems in daily life, particularly in high-stakes domains, has raised concerns about the fairness implications. While prior works have investigated static fairness measures, recent studies reveal that automated decision-making has long-term implications and that off-the-shelf fairness approaches may not serve the purpose of achieving long-term fairness. Additionally, the existence of feedback loops and the interaction between models and the environment introduces additional complexities that may deviate from the initial fairness goals. In this survey, we review existing literature on long-term fairness from different perspectives and present a taxonomy for long-term fairness studies. We highlight key challenges and consider future research directions, analyzing both current issues and potential further explorations.</description>

      <title>Tackling Data Corruption in Offline Reinforcement Learning via Sequence Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning policy from offline datasets through offline reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for scaling data-driven decision-making while avoiding unsafe and costly online interactions. However, real-world data collected from sensors or humans often contains noise and errors, posing a significant challenge for existing offline RL methods, particularly when the real-world data is limited. Our study reveals that prior research focusing on adapting predominant offline RL methods based on temporal difference learning still falls short under data corruption when the dataset is limited. In contrast, we discover that vanilla sequence modeling methods, such as Decision Transformer, exhibit robustness against data corruption, even without specialized modifications. To unlock the full potential of sequence modeling, we propose Robust Decision Rransformer (RDT) by incorporating three simple yet effective robust techniques: embedding dropout to improve the model's robustness against erroneous inputs, Gaussian weighted learning to mitigate the effects of corrupted labels, and iterative data correction to eliminate corrupted data from the source. Extensive experiments on MuJoCo, Kitchen, and Adroit tasks demonstrate RDT's superior performance under various data corruption scenarios compared to prior methods. Furthermore, RDT exhibits remarkable robustness in a more challenging setting that combines training-time data corruption with test-time observation perturbations. These results highlight the potential of sequence modeling for learning from noisy or corrupted offline datasets, thereby promoting the reliable application of offline RL in real-world scenarios.

      <description>arXiv:2408.00315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently Diffusion-based Purification (DiffPure) has been recognized as an effective defense method against adversarial examples. However, we find DiffPure which directly employs the original pre-trained diffusion models for adversarial purification, to be suboptimal. This is due to an inherent trade-off between noise purification performance and data recovery quality. Additionally, the reliability of existing evaluations for DiffPure is questionable, as they rely on weak adaptive attacks. In this work, we propose a novel Adversarial Diffusion Bridge Model, termed ADBM. ADBM directly constructs a reverse bridge from the diffused adversarial data back to its original clean examples, enhancing the purification capabilities of the original diffusion models. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation across various scenarios, ADBM has proven to be a superior and robust defense mechanism, offering significant promise for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Invariant Graph Learning Meets Information Bottleneck for Out-of-Distribution Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a major challenge in graph learning since graph neural networks (GNNs) often suffer from severe performance degradation under distribution shifts. Invariant learning, aiming to extract invariant features across varied distributions, has recently emerged as a promising approach for OOD generation. Despite the great success of invariant learning in OOD problems for Euclidean data (i.e., images), the exploration within graph data remains constrained by the complex nature of graphs. Existing studies, such as data augmentation or causal intervention, either suffer from disruptions to invariance during the graph manipulation process or face reliability issues due to a lack of supervised signals for causal parts. In this work, we propose a novel framework, called Invariant Graph Learning based on Information bottleneck theory (InfoIGL), to extract the invariant features of graphs and enhance models' generalization ability to unseen distributions. Specifically, InfoIGL introduces a redundancy filter to compress task-irrelevant information related to environmental factors. Cooperating with our designed multi-level contrastive learning, we maximize the mutual information among graphs of the same class in the downstream classification tasks, preserving invariant features for prediction to a great extent. An appealing feature of InfoIGL is its strong generalization ability without depending on supervised signal of invariance. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under OOD generalization for graph classification tasks.

Abstract: Generating physically feasible dynamics in a data-driven context is challenging, especially when adhering to physical priors expressed in specific equations or formulas. Existing methodologies often overlook the integration of physical priors, resulting in violation of basic physical laws and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that seamlessly incorporates physical priors into diffusion-based generative models to address this limitation. Our approach leverages two categories of priors: 1) distributional priors, such as roto-translational invariance, and 2) physical feasibility priors, including energy and momentum conservation laws and PDE constraints. By embedding these priors into the generative process, our method can efficiently generate physically realistic dynamics, encompassing trajectories and flows. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method produces high-quality dynamics across a diverse array of physical phenomena with remarkable robustness, underscoring its potential to advance data-driven studies in AI4Physics. Our contributions signify a substantial advancement in the field of generative modeling, offering a robust solution to generate accurate and physically consistent dynamics.</description>

      <title>CoDiCast: Conditional Diffusion Model for Global Weather Prediction with Uncertainty Quantification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate weather forecasting is critical for science and society. Yet, existing methods have not managed to simultaneously have the properties of high accuracy, low uncertainty, and high computational efficiency. On one hand, to quantify the uncertainty in weather predictions, the strategy of ensemble forecast (i.e., generating a set of diverse predictions) is often employed. However, traditional ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) is computationally intensive. On the other hand, most existing machine learning-based weather prediction (MLWP) approaches are efficient and accurate. Nevertheless, they are deterministic and cannot capture the uncertainty of weather forecasting. In this work, we propose CoDiCast, a conditional diffusion model to generate accurate global weather prediction, while achieving uncertainty quantification with ensemble forecasts and modest computational cost. The key idea is to simulate a conditional version of the reverse denoising process in diffusion models, which starts from pure Gaussian noise to generate realistic weather scenarios for a future time point. Each denoising step is conditioned on observations from the recent past. Ensemble forecasts are achieved by repeatedly sampling from stochastic Gaussian noise to represent uncertainty quantification. CoDiCast is trained on a decade of ERA5 reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms several existing data-driven methods in accuracy. Our conditional diffusion model, CoDiCast, can generate 6-day global weather forecasts, at 6-hour steps and $5.625^\circ$ latitude-longitude resolution, for over 5 variables, in about 12 minutes on a commodity A100 GPU machine with 80GB memory. The open-souced code is provided at https://github.com/JimengShi/CoDiCast.</description>

      <title>Integrating Neural Operators with Diffusion Models Improves Spectral Representation in Turbulence Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We integrate neural operators with diffusion models to address the spectral limitations of neural operators in surrogate modeling of turbulent flows. While neural operators offer computational efficiency, they exhibit deficiencies in capturing high-frequency flow dynamics, resulting in overly smooth approximations. To overcome this, we condition diffusion models on neural operators to enhance the resolution of turbulent structures. Our approach is validated for different neural operators on diverse datasets, including a high Reynolds number jet flow simulation and experimental Schlieren velocimetry. The proposed method significantly improves the alignment of predicted energy spectra with true distributions compared to neural operators alone. This enables the diffusion models to stabilize longer forecasts through diffusion-corrected autoregressive rollouts, as we demonstrate in this work. Additionally, proper orthogonal decomposition analysis demonstrates enhanced spectral fidelity in space-time. This work establishes a new paradigm for combining generative models with neural operators to advance surrogate modeling of turbulent systems, and it can be used in other scientific applications that involve microstructure and high-frequency content.

      <title>Optimism in the Face of Ambiguity Principle for Multi-Armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithms often enjoy optimal regret for adversarial as well as stochastic bandit problems and allow for a streamlined analysis. Nonetheless, FTRL algorithms require the solution of an optimization problem in every iteration and are thus computationally challenging. In contrast, Follow-The-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) algorithms achieve computational efficiency by perturbing the estimates of the rewards of the arms, but their regret analysis is cumbersome. We propose a new FTPL algorithm that generates optimal policies for both adversarial and stochastic multi-armed bandits. Like FTRL, our algorithm admits a unified regret analysis, and similar to FTPL, it offers low computational costs. Unlike existing FTPL algorithms that rely on independent additive disturbances governed by a \textit{known} distribution, we allow for disturbances governed by an \textit{ambiguous} distribution that is only known to belong to a given set and propose a principle of optimism in the face of ambiguity. Consequently, our framework generalizes existing FTPL algorithms. It also encapsulates a broad range of FTRL methods as special cases, including several optimal ones, which appears to be impossible with current FTPL methods. Finally, we use techniques from discrete choice theory to devise an efficient bisection algorithm for computing the optimistic arm sampling probabilities. This algorithm is up to $10^4$ times faster than standard FTRL algorithms that solve an optimization problem in every iteration. Our results not only settle existing conjectures but also provide new insights into the impact of perturbations by mapping FTRL to FTPL.</description>

      <title>Sable: a Performant, Efficient and Scalable Sequence Model for MARL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) progresses towards solving larger and more complex problems, it becomes increasingly important that algorithms exhibit the key properties of (1) strong performance, (2) memory efficiency and (3) scalability. In this work, we introduce Sable, a performant, memory efficient and scalable sequence modeling approach to MARL. Sable works by adapting the retention mechanism in Retentive Networks to achieve computationally efficient processing of multi-agent observations with long context memory for temporal reasoning. Through extensive evaluations across six diverse environments, we demonstrate how Sable is able to significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in a large number of diverse tasks (34 out of 45 tested). Furthermore, Sable maintains performance as we scale the number of agents, handling environments with more than a thousand agents while exhibiting a linear increase in memory usage. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to isolate the source of Sable's performance gains and confirm its efficient computational memory usage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-shot imitation learning algorithms hold the promise of reproducing unseen behavior from as little as a single demonstration at test time. Existing practical approaches view the expert demonstration as a sequence of goals, enabling imitation with a high-level goal selector, and a low-level goal-conditioned policy. However, this framework can suffer from myopic behavior: the agent's immediate actions towards achieving individual goals may undermine long-term objectives. We introduce a novel method that mitigates this issue by directly optimizing the occupancy matching objective that is intrinsic to imitation learning. We propose to lift a goal-conditioned value function to a distance between occupancies, which are in turn approximated via a learned world model. The resulting method can learn from offline, suboptimal data, and is capable of non-myopic, zero-shot imitation, as we demonstrate in complex, continuous benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: Prototypical part networks offer interpretable alternatives to black-box deep learning models. However, many of these networks rely on Euclidean prototypes, which may limit their flexibility. This work provides a comprehensive overview of various prototype formulations.

      <title>Lambda-Skip Connections: the architectural component that prevents Rank Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rank collapse, a phenomenon where embedding vectors in sequence models rapidly converge to a uniform token or equilibrium state, has recently gained attention in the deep learning literature. This phenomenon leads to reduced expressivity and potential training instabilities due to vanishing gradients. Empirical evidence suggests that architectural components like skip connections, LayerNorm, and MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs) play critical roles in mitigating rank collapse. While this issue is well-documented for transformers, alternative sequence models, such as State Space Models (SSMs), which have recently gained prominence, have not been thoroughly examined for similar vulnerabilities. This paper extends the theory of rank collapse from transformers to SSMs using a unifying framework that captures both architectures. We study how a parametrized version of the classic skip connection component, which we call \emph{lambda-skip connections}, provides guarantees for rank collapse prevention. Through analytical results, we present a sufficient condition to guarantee prevention of rank collapse across all the aforementioned architectures. We also study the necessity of this condition via ablation studies and analytical examples. To our knowledge, this is the first study that provides a general guarantee to prevent rank collapse, and that investigates rank collapse in the context of SSMs, offering valuable understanding for both theoreticians and practitioners. Finally, we validate our findings with experiments demonstrating the crucial role of architectural components such as skip connections and gating mechanisms in preventing rank collapse.</description>

      <title>KLay: Accelerating Arithmetic Circuits for Neurosymbolic AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A popular approach to neurosymbolic AI involves mapping logic formulas to arithmetic circuits (computation graphs consisting of sums and products) and passing the outputs of a neural network through these circuits. This approach enforces symbolic constraints onto a neural network in a principled and end-to-end differentiable way. Unfortunately, arithmetic circuits are challenging to run on modern AI accelerators as they exhibit a high degree of irregular sparsity. To address this limitation, we introduce knowledge layers (KLay), a new data structure to represent arithmetic circuits that can be efficiently parallelized on GPUs. Moreover, we contribute two algorithms used in the translation of traditional circuit representations to KLay and a further algorithm that exploits parallelization opportunities during circuit evaluations. We empirically show that KLay achieves speedups of multiple orders of magnitude over the state of the art, thereby paving the way towards scaling neurosymbolic AI to larger real-world applications.</description>

      <title>An Evolved Universal Transformer Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13166v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prior methods propose to offset the escalating costs of modern foundation models by dropping specific parts of their contexts with hand-designed rules, while attempting to preserve their original performance. We overcome this trade-off with Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs), introducing a learned network for memory management that improves both the performance and efficiency of transformers. We evolve NAMMs atop pre-trained transformers to provide different latent contexts focusing on the most relevant information for individual layers and attention heads. NAMMs are universally applicable to any model using self-attention as they condition exclusively on the values in the produced attention matrices. Learning NAMMs on a small set of problems, we achieve substantial performance improvements across multiple long-context benchmarks while cutting the model's input contexts up to a fraction of the original sizes. We show the generality of our conditioning enables zero-shot transfer of NAMMs trained only on language to entirely new transformer architectures even across input modalities, with their benefits carrying over to vision and reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Mixed-curvature decision trees and random forests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision trees (DTs) and their random forest (RF) extensions are workhorses of classification and regression in Euclidean spaces. However, algorithms for learning in non-Euclidean spaces are still limited. We extend DT and RF algorithms to product manifolds: Cartesian products of several hyperbolic, hyperspherical, or Euclidean components. Such manifolds handle heterogeneous curvature while still factorizing neatly into simpler components, making them compelling embedding spaces for complex datasets. Our novel angular reformulation of DTs respects the geometry of the product manifold, yielding splits that are geodesically convex, maximum-margin, and composable. In the special cases of single-component manifolds, our method simplifies to its Euclidean or hyperbolic counterparts, or introduces hyperspherical DT algorithms, depending on the curvature. We benchmark our method on various classification, regression, and link prediction tasks on synthetic data, graph embeddings, mixed-curvature variational autoencoder latent spaces, and empirical data. Compared to 7 other classifiers, product RFs ranked first on 25 out of 57 benchmarks, and placed in the top 2 for 46 out of 57. This highlights the value of product RFs as straightforward yet powerful new tools for data analysis in product manifolds.

      <description>arXiv:2410.13914v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an importance sampling method for tractable and efficient estimation of counterfactual expressions in general settings, named Exogenous Matching. By minimizing a common upper bound of counterfactual estimators, we transform the variance minimization problem into a conditional distribution learning problem, enabling its integration with existing conditional distribution modeling approaches. We validate the theoretical results through experiments under various types and settings of Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and demonstrate the outperformance on counterfactual estimation tasks compared to other existing importance sampling methods. We also explore the impact of injecting structural prior knowledge (counterfactual Markov boundaries) on the results. Finally, we apply this method to identifiable proxy SCMs and demonstrate the unbiasedness of the estimates, empirically illustrating the applicability of the method to practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>On the Regularization of Learnable Embeddings for Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In forecasting multiple time series, accounting for the individual features of each sequence can be challenging. To address this, modern deep learning methods for time series analysis combine a shared (global) model with local layers, specific to each time series, often implemented as learnable embeddings. Ideally, these local embeddings should encode meaningful representations of the unique dynamics of each sequence. However, when these are learned end-to-end as parameters of a forecasting model, they may end up acting as mere sequence identifiers. Shared processing blocks may then become reliant on such identifiers, limiting their transferability to new contexts. In this paper, we address this issue by investigating methods to regularize the learning of local learnable embeddings for time series processing. Specifically, we perform the first extensive empirical study on the subject and show how such regularizations consistently improve performance in widely adopted architectures. Furthermore, we show that methods attempting to prevent the co-adaptation of local and global parameters by means of embeddings perturbation are particularly effective in this context. In this regard, we include in the comparison several perturbation-based regularization methods, going as far as periodically resetting the embeddings during training. The obtained results provide an important contribution to understanding the interplay between learnable local parameters and shared processing layers: a key challenge in modern time series processing models and a step toward developing effective foundation models for time series.</description>

      <title>Small Singular Values Matter: A Random Matrix Analysis of Transformer Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly central to AI applications, understanding their inner workings is essential. In this work, we analyze the spectra of weight matrices in pretrained transformer models through the lens of random matrix theory (RMT) to uncover learned structures. We find that certain regions of the weight matrix spectra deviate markedly from RMT predictions, indicating richer feature encoding. By comparing the corresponding singular vectors to eigenvectors of activation covariance matrices, we observe substantial overlap precisely where the spectra deviate from RMT expectations. Our analysis further reveals the important role of small singular values in LLMs, showing that these values contain significant information, a claim supported by increased perplexity when they are removed from the model. Although these small values may appear unimportant prior to task-specific fine-tuning, removing them afterward significantly degrades performance, revealing that fine-tuning refines the model primarily in these spectral regions. These results emphasize the critical role of small singular values, suggesting that removing them in an already aligned transformer can be detrimental, as it may compromise model alignment.</description>

      <title>COAT: Compressing Optimizer states and Activation for Memory-Efficient FP8 Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: FP8 training has emerged as a promising method for improving training efficiency. Existing frameworks accelerate training by applying FP8 computation to linear layers while leaving optimizer states and activations in higher precision, which fails to fully optimize memory usage. This paper introduces COAT (Compressing Optimizer States and Activations for FP8 Training), a novel FP8 training framework designed to significantly reduce memory footprint when training large models. COAT addresses current limitations through two key innovations: (1) Dynamic Range Expansion, which aligns optimizer state distributions more closely with the FP8 representation range, thereby reducing quantization error, and (2) Mixed-Granularity Activation Quantization, which optimizes activation memory using a combination of per-tensor and per-group quantization strategies. Experiments demonstrate that COAT effectively reduces end-to-end training memory footprint by 1.54x compared to BF16 while achieving nearly lossless performance across various tasks, such as Large Language Model pretraining and fine-tuning and Vision Language Model training. COAT also achieves a 1.43x end-to-end training speedup compared to BF16, performing on par with or surpassing TransformerEngine's speedup. COAT enables efficient full-parameter training of large models on fewer GPUs, and facilitates doubling the batch size in distributed training settings, providing a practical solution for scaling large-scale model training. The code is available at https://github.com/NVlabs/COAT.</description>

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) is a major problem in reinforcement learning (RL) because it provides a simple, unsupervised, and domain-agnostic way to acquire diverse behaviors and representations from unlabeled data without rewards. Despite the importance of this setting, we lack a standard benchmark that can systematically evaluate the capabilities of offline GCRL algorithms. In this work, we propose OGBench, a new, high-quality benchmark for algorithms research in offline goal-conditioned RL. OGBench consists of 8 types of environments, 85 datasets, and reference implementations of 6 representative offline GCRL algorithms. We have designed these challenging and realistic environments and datasets to directly probe different capabilities of algorithms, such as stitching, long-horizon reasoning, and the ability to handle high-dimensional inputs and stochasticity. While representative algorithms may rank similarly on prior benchmarks, our experiments reveal stark strengths and weaknesses in these different capabilities, providing a strong foundation for building new algorithms.

      <description>arXiv:2410.22967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread usage of the Internet of Things (IoT) has raised the risks of cyber threats, thus developing Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs) that can adapt to evolving or new attacks is critical. Previous studies primarily focused on offline unsupervised learning methods to safeguard ADSs, which is not applicable in practical real-world applications. Besides, most of them strongly rely on assumptions of known legitimates and fail to satisfy the interpretable requirements in security applications, creating barriers to the adoption in practice. In this paper, we design Adaptive NAD, a general framework to improve and interpret online unsupervised anomaly detection in security domains. An interpretable two-layer anomaly detection strategy is proposed to generate reliable high-confidence pseudo-labels. Then, an online learning scheme is introduced to update Adaptive NAD by a novel threshold calculation technique to adapt to new threats. Experimental results demonstrate that Adaptive NAD achieves more than 5.4%, 23.0%, and 3.2% improvements in SPAUC compared with state-of-the-art solutions on the CIC-Darknet2020, CIC-DoHBrw-2020, and Edge-IIoTset datasets, respectively.

Abstract: Generalization outside the scope of one's training data requires leveraging prior knowledge about the effects that transfer, and the effects that don't, between different data sources. Transfer learning is a framework for specifying and refining this knowledge about sets of source (training) and target (prediction) data. A challenging open problem is addressing the empirical phenomenon of negative transfer, whereby the transfer learner performs worse on the target data after taking the source data into account than before. We first introduce a Bayesian perspective on negative transfer, and then a method to address it. The key insight from our formulation is that negative transfer can stem from misspecified prior information about non-transferable causes of the source data. Our proposed method, proxy-informed robust method for probabilistic transfer learning (PROMPT), does not require prior knowledge of the source data (the data sources may be "unknown"). PROMPT is thus applicable when differences between tasks are unobserved, such as in the presence of latent confounders. Moreover, the learner need not have access to observations in the target task (cannot "fine-tune"), and instead makes use of proxy (indirect) information. Our theoretical results show that the threat of negative transfer does not depend on the informativeness of the proxy information, highlighting the usefulness of PROMPT in cases where only noisy indirect information, such as human feedback, is available.</description>

      <title>Exploring Hierarchical Molecular Graph Representation in Multimodal LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the milestones in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models, we have seen a surge in applying LLMs to biochemical tasks. Leveraging graph features and molecular text representations, LLMs can tackle various tasks, such as predicting chemical reaction outcomes and describing molecular properties. However, most current work overlooks the *multi-level nature* of the graph modality, even though different chemistry tasks may benefit from different feature levels. In this work, we first study the effect of feature granularity and reveal that even reducing all GNN-generated feature tokens to a single one does not significantly impact model performance. We then investigate the effect of various graph feature levels and demonstrate that both the quality of LLM-generated molecules and model performance across different tasks depend on different graph feature levels. Therefore, we conclude with two key insights: (1) current molecular-related multimodal LLMs lack a comprehensive understanding of graph features, and (2) static processing is not sufficient for hierarchical graph feature. We share our findings in detail, with the hope of paving the way for the community to develop more advanced multimodal LLMs for incorporating molecular graphs.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Federated Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Regression on Small-Scale and High-Dimensional Biological Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning models often struggle with generalization in small, heterogeneous datasets due to domain shifts caused by variations in data collection and population differences. This challenge is particularly pronounced in biological data, where data is high-dimensional, small-scale, and decentralized across institutions. While federated domain adaptation methods (FDA) aim to address these challenges, most existing approaches rely on deep learning and focus on classification tasks, making them unsuitable for small-scale, high-dimensional applications. In this work, we propose freda, a privacy-preserving federated method for unsupervised domain adaptation in regression tasks. Unlike deep learning-based FDA approaches, freda is the first method to enable the federated training of Gaussian Processes to model complex feature relationships while ensuring complete data privacy through randomized encoding and secure aggregation. This allows for effective domain adaptation without direct access to raw data, making it well-suited for applications involving high-dimensional, heterogeneous datasets. We evaluate freda on the challenging task of age prediction from DNA methylation data, demonstrating that it achieves performance comparable to the centralized state-of-the-art method while preserving complete data privacy.</description>

      <title>Noise Matters: Diffusion Model-based Urban Mobility Generation with Collaborative Noise Priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With global urbanization, the focus on sustainable cities has largely grown, driving research into equity, resilience, and urban planning, which often relies on mobility data. The rise of web-based apps and mobile devices has provided valuable user data for mobility-related research. However, real-world mobility data is costly and raises privacy concerns. To protect privacy while retaining key features of real-world movement, the demand for synthetic data has steadily increased. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown great potential for mobility trajectory generation due to their ability to model randomness and uncertainty. However, existing approaches often directly apply identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise sampling from image generation techniques, which fail to account for the spatiotemporal correlations and social interactions that shape urban mobility patterns. In this paper, we propose CoDiffMob, a diffusion model for urban mobility generation with collaborative noise priors, we emphasize the critical role of noise in diffusion models for generating mobility data. By leveraging both individual movement characteristics and population-wide dynamics, we construct novel collaborative noise priors that provide richer and more informative guidance throughout the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, with generated data accurately capturing both individual preferences and collective patterns, achieving an improvement of over 32%. Furthermore, it can effectively replace web-derived mobility data to better support downstream applications, while safeguarding user privacy and fostering a more secure and ethical web. This highlights its tremendous potential for applications in sustainable city-related research. The code and data are available at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/CoDiffMob.</description>

      <title>A Unifying View of Linear Function Approximation in Off-Policy RL Through Matrix Splitting and Preconditioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditionally, TD and FQI are viewed as differing in the number of updates toward the target value function: TD makes one update, FQI makes an infinite number, and Partial Fitted Q-Iteration (PFQI) performs a finite number, such as the use of a target network in Deep Q-Networks (DQN) in the OPE setting. This perspective, however, fails to capture the convergence connections between these algorithms and may lead to incorrect conclusions, for example, that the convergence of TD implies the convergence of FQI. In this paper, we focus on linear value function approximation and offer a new perspective, unifying TD, FQI, and PFQI as the same iterative method for solving the Least Squares Temporal Difference (LSTD) system, but using different preconditioners and matrix splitting schemes. TD uses a constant preconditioner, FQI employs a data-feature adaptive preconditioner, and PFQI transitions between the two. Then, we reveal that in the context of linear function approximation, increasing the number of updates under the same target value function essentially represents a transition from using a constant preconditioner to data-feature adaptive preconditioner. This unifying perspective also simplifies the analyses of the convergence conditions for these algorithms and clarifies many issues. Consequently, we fully characterize the convergence of each algorithm without assuming specific properties of the chosen features (e.g., linear independence). We also examine how common assumptions about feature representations affect convergence, and discover new conditions on features that are important for convergence. These convergence conditions allow us to establish the convergence connections between these algorithms and to address important questions.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning convolution operators associated to compact Abelian groups. We study a regularization-based approach and provide corresponding learning guarantees, discussing natural regularity condition on the convolution kernel. More precisely, we assume the convolution kernel is a function in a translation invariant Hilbert space and analyze a natural ridge regression (RR) estimator. Building on existing results for RR, we characterize the accuracy of the estimator in terms of finite sample bounds. Interestingly, regularity assumptions which are classical in the analysis of RR, have a novel and natural interpretation in terms of space/frequency localization. Theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Technology Landscape through Topic Modeling, Expert Involvement, and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, organizations face the challenge of integrating external insights into their decision-making processes to stay competitive. To address this issue, this study proposes a method that combines topic modeling, expert knowledge inputs, and reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the detection of technological changes. The method has four main steps: (1) Build a relevant topic model, starting with textual data like documents and reports to find key themes. (2) Create aspect-based topic models. Experts use curated keywords to build models that showcase key domain-specific aspects. (3) Iterative analysis and RL driven refinement: We examine metrics such as topic magnitude, similarity, entropy shifts, and how models change over time. We optimize topic selection with RL. Our reward function balances the diversity and similarity of the topics. (4) Synthesis and operational integration: Each iteration provides insights. In the final phase, the experts check these insights and reach new conclusions. These conclusions are designed for use in the firm's operational processes. The application is tested by forecasting trends in quantum communication. Results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in identifying, ranking, and tracking trends that align with expert input, providing a robust tool for exploring evolving technological landscapes. This research offers a scalable and adaptive solution for organizations to make informed strategic decisions in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Personalized Federated Prompt Learning for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) are pivotal in revolutionizing customer support and operations by integrating multiple modalities such as text, images, and audio. Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) is a recently proposed approach that combines pre-trained multimodal LLMs such as vision-language models with federated learning to create personalized, privacy-preserving AI systems. However, balancing the competing goals of personalization, generalization, and privacy remains a significant challenge. Over-personalization can lead to overfitting, reducing generalizability, while stringent privacy measures, such as differential privacy, can hinder both personalization and generalization. In this paper, we propose a Differentially Private Federated Prompt Learning (DP-FPL) approach to tackle this challenge by leveraging a low-rank factorization scheme to capture generalization while maintaining a residual term that preserves expressiveness for personalization. To ensure privacy, we introduce a novel method where we apply local differential privacy to the two low-rank components of the local prompt, and global differential privacy to the global prompt. Our approach mitigates the impact of privacy noise on the model performance while balancing the tradeoff between personalization and generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over other benchmarks.</description>

      <title>HorNets: Learning from Discrete and Continuous Signals with Routing Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Construction of neural network architectures suitable for learning from both continuous and discrete tabular data is a challenging research endeavor. Contemporary high-dimensional tabular data sets are often characterized by a relatively small instance count, requiring data-efficient learning. We propose HorNets (Horn Networks), a neural network architecture with state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-life data sets from scarce-data tabular domains. HorNets are based on a clipped polynomial-like activation function, extended by a custom discrete-continuous routing mechanism that decides which part of the neural network to optimize based on the input's cardinality. By explicitly modeling parts of the feature combination space or combining whole space in a linear attention-like manner, HorNets dynamically decide which mode of operation is the most suitable for a given piece of data with no explicit supervision. This architecture is one of the few approaches that reliably retrieves logical clauses (including noisy XNOR) and achieves state-of-the-art classification performance on 14 real-life biomedical high-dimensional data sets. HorNets are made freely available under a permissive license alongside a synthetic generator of categorical benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Online Inverse Linear Optimization: Improved Regret Bound, Robustness to Suboptimality, and Toward Tight Regret Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14349v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an online learning problem where, over $T$ rounds, a learner observes both time-varying sets of feasible actions and an agent's optimal actions, selected by solving linear optimization over the feasible actions. The learner sequentially makes predictions of the agent's underlying linear objective function, and their quality is measured by the regret, the cumulative gap between optimal objective values and those achieved by following the learner's predictions. A seminal work by B\"armann et al. (ICML 2017) showed that online learning methods can be applied to this problem to achieve regret bounds of $O(\sqrt{T})$. Recently, Besbes et al. (COLT 2021, Oper. Res. 2023) significantly improved the result by achieving an $O(n^4\ln T)$ regret bound, where $n$ is the dimension of the ambient space of objective vectors. Their method, based on the ellipsoid method, runs in polynomial time but is inefficient for large $n$ and $T$. In this paper, we obtain an $O(n\ln T)$ regret bound, improving upon the previous bound of $O(n^4\ln T)$ by a factor of $n^3$. Our method is simple and efficient: we apply the online Newton step (ONS) to appropriate exp-concave loss functions. Moreover, for the case where the agent's actions are possibly suboptimal, we establish an $O(n\ln T+\sqrt{\Delta_Tn\ln T})$ regret bound, where $\Delta_T$ is the cumulative suboptimality of the agent's actions. This bound is achieved by using MetaGrad, which runs ONS with $\Theta(\ln T)$ different learning rates in parallel. We also provide a simple instance that implies an $\Omega(n)$ lower bound, showing that our $O(n\ln T)$ bound is tight up to an $O(\ln T)$ factor. This gives rise to a natural question: can the $O(\ln T)$ factor in the upper bound be removed? For the special case of $n=2$, we show that an $O(1)$ regret bound is possible, while we delineate challenges in extending this result to higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Batch normalization (BatchNorm) is a popular layer normalization technique used when training deep neural networks. It has been shown to enhance the training speed and accuracy of deep learning models. However, the mechanics by which BatchNorm achieves these benefits is an active area of research, and different perspectives have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the effect of BatchNorm on the resulting hidden representations, that is, the vectors of activation values formed as samples are processed at each hidden layer. Specifically, we consider the sparsity of these representations, as well as their implicit clustering -- the creation of groups of representations that are similar to some extent. We contrast image classification models trained with and without batch normalization and highlight consistent differences observed. These findings highlight that BatchNorm's effect on representational sparsity is not a significant factor affecting generalization, while the representations of models trained with BatchNorm tend to show more advantageous clustering characteristics.</description>

      <title>ZETA: Leveraging Z-order Curves for Efficient Top-k Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over recent years, the Transformer has become a fundamental building block for sequence modeling architectures. Yet at its core is the use of self-attention, whose memory and computational cost grow quadratically with the sequence length $N$, rendering it prohibitively expensive for long sequences. A promising approach is top-$k$ attention, which selects only the $k$ most relevant tokens and achieves performance comparable to vanilla self-attention while significantly reducing space and computational demands. However, causal masks require the current query token to only attend to past tokens, preventing the existing top-$k$ attention method from efficiently searching for the most relevant tokens in parallel, thereby limiting training efficiency. In this work, we propose ZETA, leveraging \textbf{Z}-Order Curves for \textbf{E}fficient \textbf{T}op-$k$ \textbf{A}ttention, to enable parallel querying of past tokens for entire sequences. % in both space and time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$. We first theoretically show that the choice of key and query dimensions involves a trade-off between the curse of dimensionality and the preservation of relative distances after projection. In light of this insight, we propose reducing the dimensionality of keys and queries in contrast to values and further leverage $Z$-order curves to map low-dimensional keys and queries into \emph{one}-dimensional space, which permits parallel sorting, thereby largely improving the efficiency for top-$k$ token selection. Experimental results demonstrate that ZETA matches the performance of standard attention on the synthetic \textsc{Multi-Query Associative Recall} task and outperforms attention and its variants on \textsc{Long Range Arena} and \textsc{WikiText-103} language modeling.</description>

Abstract: Among generative neural models, flow matching techniques stand out for their simple applicability and good scaling properties. Here, velocity fields of curves connecting a simple latent and a target distribution are learned. Then the corresponding ordinary differential equation can be used to sample from a target distribution, starting in samples from the latent one. This paper reviews from a mathematical point of view different techniques to learn the velocity fields of absolutely continuous curves in the Wasserstein geometry. We show how the velocity fields can be characterized and learned via i) transport plans (couplings) between latent and target distributions, ii) Markov kernels and iii) stochastic processes, where the latter two include the coupling approach, but are in general broader. Besides this main goal, we show how flow matching can be used for solving Bayesian inverse problems, where the definition of conditional Wasserstein distances plays a central role. Finally, we briefly address continuous normalizing flows and score matching techniques, which approach the learning of velocity fields of curves from other directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by multi-task and meta-learning approaches, we consider the problem of learning structure shared by tasks or users, such as shared low-rank representations or clustered structures. While all previous works focus on well-specified linear regression, we consider more general convex objectives, where the structural low-rank and cluster assumptions are expressed on the optima of each function. We show that under mild assumptions such as \textit{Hessian concentration} and \textit{noise concentration at the optimum}, rank and clustered regularized estimators recover such structure, provided the number of samples per task and the number of tasks are large enough. We then study the problem of recovering the subspace in which all the solutions lie, in the setting where there is only a single sample per task: we show that in that case, the rank-constrained estimator can recover the subspace, but that the number of tasks needs to scale exponentially large with the dimension of the subspace. Finally, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm via nuclear norm constraints for learning a shared linear representation in the context of convex learning objectives.</description>

However, their effectiveness is often hindered by the sparsity of distributed networks and data heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a momentum-accelerated distributed stochastic gradient algorithm, termed Exact-Diffusion with Momentum (EDM), which mitigates the bias from data heterogeneity and incorporates momentum techniques commonly used in deep learning to enhance convergence rate. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the EDM algorithm converges sub-linearly to the neighborhood of the optimal solution, the radius of which is irrespective of data heterogeneity, when applied to non-convex objective functions; under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, which is a weaker assumption than strong convexity, it converges linearly to the target region. Our analysis techniques employed to handle momentum in complex distributed parameter update structures yield a sufficiently tight convergence upper bound, offering a new perspective for the theoretical analysis of other momentum-based distributed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models to Enhance Machine Learning Interpretability and Predictive Performance: A Case Study on Emergency Department Returns for Mental Health Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00025</link>

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate whether integrating large language models (LLMs) with traditional machine learning approaches improves both the predictive accuracy and clinical interpretability of ED mental health returns risk models. Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 42,464 ED visits for 27,904 unique mental health patients at an Academic Medical Center in the deep South of the United States between January 2018 and December 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: Two primary outcomes were evaluated: (1) 30 days ED return prediction accuracy and (2) model interpretability through a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework integrating SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values with contextual clinical knowledge. Results: The proposed machine learning interpretability framework, leveraging LLM, achieved 99% accuracy in translating complex model predictions into clinically relevant explanations. Integration of LLM-extracted features enhanced predictive performance, improving the XGBoost model area under the curve (AUC) from 0.73 to 0.76. The LLM-based feature extraction using 10-shot learning significantly outperformed traditional approaches, achieving an accuracy of 0.882 and an F1 score of 0.86 for chief complaint classification (compared to conventional methods with an accuracy range of 0.59 to 0.63) and demonstrating accuracy values ranging from 0.65 to 0.93 across multiple SDoH categories, underscoring its robust performance in extracting features from clinical notes. Conclusions and Relevance: Integrating LLMs with traditional machine learning models yielded modest but consistent improvements in ED return prediction accuracy while substantially enhancing model interpretability through automated, clinically relevant explanations. This approach offers a framework for translating complex predictive analytics into actionable clinical insights.</description>

      <title>Bridging Internal Probability and Self-Consistency for Effective and Efficient LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities. However, single-shot inference often yields unreliable results for complex reasoning tasks, leading researchers to explore multiple reasoning paths through methods such as perplexity and self-consistency. In this paper, we present the first theoretical error decomposition analysis of these techniques, breaking down their error into estimation error and model error. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: perplexity methods suffer from substantial model error due to the absence of a proper consistency function, while self-consistency exhibits high estimation error due to a slow error convergence rate. To overcome these limitations, we propose Reasoning-Pruning Perplexity Consistency (RPC). This approach combines Perplexity Consistency, which seamlessly integrates LLM perplexity with self-consistency, and Reasoning Pruning, which eliminates low-probability reasoning paths to effectively prevent the degeneration of estimation error reduction. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that RPC not only accelerates the convergence rate of estimation error to an exponential level but also holds strong potential for further reducing model error. Extensive empirical evaluations on seven benchmark datasets confirm that RPC can significantly improve reasoning performance, sample efficiency, and confidence reliability.</description>

      <title>Continuous Autoregressive Modeling with Stochastic Monotonic Alignment for Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel autoregressive modeling approach for speech synthesis, combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a multi-modal latent space and an autoregressive model that uses Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) as the conditional probability distribution. Unlike previous methods that rely on residual vector quantization, our model leverages continuous speech representations from the VAE's latent space, greatly simplifying the training and inference pipelines. We also introduce a stochastic monotonic alignment mechanism to enforce strict monotonic alignments. Our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art autoregressive model VALL-E in both subjective and objective evaluations, achieving these results with only 10.3\% of VALL-E's parameters. This demonstrates the potential of continuous speech language models as a more efficient alternative to existing quantization-based speech language models.

      <title>Self-Improving Transformers Overcome Easy-to-Hard and Length Generalization Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models often struggle with length generalization and solving complex problem instances beyond their training distribution. We present a self-improvement approach where models iteratively generate and learn from their own solutions, progressively tackling harder problems while maintaining a standard transformer architecture. Across diverse tasks including arithmetic, string manipulation, and maze solving, self-improving enables models to solve problems far beyond their initial training distribution-for instance, generalizing from 10-digit to 100-digit addition without apparent saturation. We observe that in some cases filtering for correct self-generated examples leads to exponential improvements in out-of-distribution performance across training rounds. Additionally, starting from pretrained models significantly accelerates this self-improvement process for several tasks. Our results demonstrate how controlled weak-to-strong curricula can systematically teach a model logical extrapolation without any changes to the positional embeddings, or the model architecture.</description>

      <title>Robust Federated Finetuning of LLMs via Alternating Optimization of LoRA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) optimize federated training by reducing computational and communication costs. We propose RoLoRA, a federated framework using alternating optimization to fine-tune LoRA adapters. Our approach emphasizes the importance of learning up and down projection matrices to enhance expressiveness and robustness. We use both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the advantages of RoLoRA over prior approaches that either generate imperfect model updates or limit expressiveness of the model. We present theoretical analysis on a simplified linear model to demonstrate the importance of learning both down-projection and up-projection matrices in LoRA. We provide extensive experimental evaluations on a toy neural network on MNIST as well as large language models including RoBERTa-Large, Llama-2-7B on diverse tasks to demonstrate the advantages of RoLoRA over other methods.</description>

Abstract: How to interact with LLMs through \emph{instructions} has been widely studied by researchers. However, previous studies have treated the emergence of instructions and the training of LLMs on task data as separate processes, overlooking the inherent unity between the two. This paper proposes a neural network framework, VaiBot, that integrates VAE and VIB, designed to uniformly model, learn, and infer both deduction and induction tasks under LLMs. Through experiments, we demonstrate that VaiBot performs on par with existing baseline methods in terms of deductive capabilities while significantly surpassing them in inductive capabilities. We also find that VaiBot can scale up using general instruction-following data and exhibits excellent one-shot induction abilities. We finally synergistically integrate the deductive and inductive processes of VaiBot. Through T-SNE dimensionality reduction, we observe that its inductive-deductive process significantly improves the distribution of training parameters, enabling it to outperform baseline methods in inductive reasoning tasks. The code and data for this paper can be found at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/VaiBot-021F.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Similarity Metrics for Data Selection for Language Model Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Similarity between training examples is used to curate pretraining datasets for language models by many methods -- for diversification and to select examples similar to high-quality data. However, similarity is typically measured with off-the-shelf embedding models that are generic or trained for tasks such as retrieval. This paper introduces a framework to analyze the suitability of embedding models specifically for data curation in the language model pretraining setting. We quantify the correlation between similarity in the embedding space to similarity in pretraining loss between different training examples, and how diversifying in the embedding space affects pretraining quality. We analyze a variety of embedding models in our framework, with experiments using the Pile dataset for pretraining a 1.7B parameter decoder-only language model. We find that the embedding models we consider are all useful for pretraining data curation. Moreover, a simple approach of averaging per-token embeddings proves to be surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated embedding models -- likely because the latter are not designed specifically for pretraining data curation. Indeed, we believe our analysis and evaluation framework can serve as a foundation for the design of embedding models that specifically reason about similarity in pretraining datasets.</description>

      <title>PH-VAE: A Polynomial Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder Towards Disentangled Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a simple and efficient generative artificial intelligence method for modeling complex probability distributions of various types of data, such as images and texts. However, it suffers some main shortcomings, such as lack of interpretability in the latent variables, difficulties in tuning hyperparameters while training, producing blurry, unrealistic downstream outputs or loss of information due to how it calculates loss functions and recovers data distributions, overfitting, and origin gravity effect for small data sets, among other issues. These and other limitations have caused unsatisfactory generation effects for the data with complex distributions. In this work, we proposed and developed a polynomial hierarchical variational autoencoder (PH-VAE), in which we used a polynomial hierarchical date format to generate or to reconstruct the data distributions. In doing so, we also proposed a novel Polynomial Divergence in the loss function to replace or generalize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which results in systematic and drastic improvements in both accuracy and reproducibility of the re-constructed distribution function as well as the quality of re-constructed data images while keeping the dataset size the same but capturing fine resolution of the data. Moreover, we showed that the proposed PH-VAE has some form of disentangled representation learning ability.</description>

      <title>MATH-Perturb: Benchmarking LLMs' Math Reasoning Abilities against Hard Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, which has triggered the discussion of whether the performance is achieved by true reasoning capability or memorization. To investigate this question, prior work has constructed mathematical benchmarks when questions undergo simple perturbations -- modifications that still preserve the underlying reasoning patterns of the solutions. However, no work has explored hard perturbations, which fundamentally change the nature of the problem so that the original solution steps do not apply. To bridge the gap, we construct MATH-P-Simple and MATH-P-Hard via simple perturbation and hard perturbation, respectively. Each consists of 279 perturbed math problems derived from level-5 (hardest) problems in the MATH dataset (Hendrycksmath et. al., 2021). We observe significant performance drops on MATH-P-Hard across various models, including o1-mini (-16.49%) and gemini-2.0-flash-thinking (-12.9%). We also raise concerns about a novel form of memorization where models blindly apply learned problem-solving skills without assessing their applicability to modified contexts. This issue is amplified when using original problems for in-context learning. We call for research efforts to address this challenge, which is critical for developing more robust and reliable reasoning models.</description>

      <title>On the Benefits of Attribute-Driven Graph Domain Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) addresses a pressing challenge in cross-network learning, particularly pertinent due to the absence of labeled data in real-world graph datasets. Recent studies attempted to learn domain invariant representations by eliminating structural shifts between graphs. In this work, we show that existing methodologies have overlooked the significance of the graph node attribute, a pivotal factor for graph domain alignment. Specifically, we first reveal the impact of node attributes for GDA by theoretically proving that in addition to the graph structural divergence between the domains, the node attribute discrepancy also plays a critical role in GDA. Moreover, we also empirically show that the attribute shift is more substantial than the topology shift, which further underscores the importance of node attribute alignment in GDA. Inspired by this finding, a novel cross-channel module is developed to fuse and align both views between the source and target graphs for GDA. Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>GraNNite: Enabling High-Performance Execution of Graph Neural Networks on Resource-Constrained Neural Processing Units</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are vital for learning from graph-structured data, enabling applications in network analysis, recommendation systems, and speech analytics. Deploying them on edge devices like client PCs and laptops enhances real-time processing, privacy, and cloud independence. GNNs aid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Large Language Models (LLMs) and enable event-based vision tasks. However, irregular memory access, sparsity, and dynamic structures cause high latency and energy overhead on resource-constrained devices. While modern edge processors integrate CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs, NPUs designed for data-parallel tasks struggle with irregular GNN computations. We introduce GraNNite, the first hardware-aware framework optimizing GNN execution on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) SOTA DNN accelerators via a structured three-step methodology: (1) enabling NPU execution, (2) optimizing performance, and (3) trading accuracy for efficiency gains. Step 1 employs GraphSplit for workload distribution and StaGr for static aggregation, while GrAd and NodePad handle dynamic graphs. Step 2 boosts performance using EffOp for control-heavy tasks and GraSp for sparsity exploitation. Graph Convolution optimizations PreG, SymG, and CacheG reduce redundancy and memory transfers. Step 3 balances quality versus efficiency, where QuantGr applies INT8 quantization, and GrAx1, GrAx2, and GrAx3 accelerate attention, broadcast-add, and SAGE-max aggregation. On Intel Core Ultra AI PCs, GraNNite achieves 2.6X to 7.6X speedups over default NPU mappings and up to 8.6X energy gains over CPUs and GPUs, delivering 10.8X and 6.7X higher performance than CPUs and GPUs, respectively, across GNN models.</description>

      <title>XAMBA: Enabling Efficient State Space Models on Resource-Constrained Neural Processing Units</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to transformers for sequential data tasks, offering linear or near-linear scalability with sequence length, making them ideal for long-sequence applications in NLP, vision, and edge AI, including real-time transcription, translation, and contextual search. These applications require lightweight, high-performance models for deployment on resource-constrained devices like laptops and PCs. Designing specialized accelerators for every emerging neural network is costly and impractical; instead, optimizing models for existing NPUs in AI PCs provides a scalable solution. To this end, we propose XAMBA, the first framework to enable and optimize SSMs on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) state-of-the-art (SOTA) NPUs. XAMBA follows a three-step methodology: (1) enabling SSMs on NPUs, (2) optimizing performance to meet KPI requirements, and (3) trading accuracy for additional performance gains. After enabling SSMs on NPUs, XAMBA mitigates key bottlenecks using CumBA and ReduBA, replacing sequential CumSum and ReduceSum operations with matrix-based computations, significantly improving execution speed and memory efficiency. Additionally, ActiBA enhances performance by approximating expensive activation functions (e.g., Swish, Softplus) using piecewise linear mappings, reducing latency with minimal accuracy loss. Evaluations on an Intel Core Ultra Series 2 AI PC show that XAMBA achieves up to 2.6X speed-up over the baseline. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/arghadippurdue/XAMBA.</description>

      <title>Geometry-aware RL for Manipulation of Varying Shapes and Deformable Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manipulating objects with varying geometries and deformable objects is a major challenge in robotics. Tasks such as insertion with different objects or cloth hanging require precise control and effective modelling of complex dynamics. In this work, we frame this problem through the lens of a heterogeneous graph that comprises smaller sub-graphs, such as actuators and objects, accompanied by different edge types describing their interactions. This graph representation serves as a unified structure for both rigid and deformable objects tasks, and can be extended further to tasks comprising multiple actuators. To evaluate this setup, we present a novel and challenging reinforcement learning benchmark, including rigid insertion of diverse objects, as well as rope and cloth manipulation with multiple end-effectors. These tasks present a large search space, as both the initial and target configurations are uniformly sampled in 3D space. To address this issue, we propose a novel graph-based policy model, dubbed Heterogeneous Equivariant Policy (HEPi), utilizing $SE(3)$ equivariant message passing networks as the main backbone to exploit the geometric symmetry. In addition, by modeling explicit heterogeneity, HEPi can outperform Transformer-based and non-heterogeneous equivariant policies in terms of average returns, sample efficiency, and generalization to unseen objects.</description>

      <title>Online Scheduling for LLM Inference with KV Cache Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference, where a trained model generates text one word at a time in response to user prompts, is a computationally intensive process requiring efficient scheduling to optimize latency and resource utilization. A key challenge in LLM inference is the management of the Key-Value (KV) cache, which reduces redundant computations but introduces memory constraints. In this work, we model LLM inference with KV cache constraints theoretically and propose novel batching and scheduling algorithms that minimize inference latency while effectively managing the KV cache's memory.
  We analyze both semi-online and fully online scheduling models, and our results are threefold. First, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves exact optimality in terms of average latency in the semi-online prompt arrival model. Second, in the fully online case with a stochastic prompt arrival, we introduce an efficient online scheduling algorithm with constant regret. Third, we prove that no algorithm (deterministic or randomized) can achieve a constant competitive ratio in fully online adversarial settings. Our empirical evaluations on a public LLM inference dataset, using the Llama-70B model on A100 GPUs, show that our approach significantly outperforms benchmark algorithms used currently in practice, achieving lower latency while reducing energy consumption. Overall, our results offer a path toward more sustainable and cost-effective LLM deployment.</description>

      <title>Crime Forecasting: A Spatio-temporal Analysis with Deep Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study uses deep-learning models to predict city partition crime counts on specific days. It helps police enhance surveillance, gather intelligence, and proactively prevent crimes. We formulate crime count prediction as a spatiotemporal sequence challenge, where both input data and prediction targets are spatiotemporal sequences. In order to improve the accuracy of crime forecasting, we introduce a new model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. We conducted a comparative analysis to access the effects of various data sequences, including raw and binned data, on the prediction errors of four deep learning forecasting models. Directly inputting raw crime data into the forecasting model causes high prediction errors, making the model unsuitable for real - world use. The findings indicate that the proposed CNN-LSTM model achieves optimal performance when crime data is categorized into 10 or 5 groups. Data binning can enhance forecasting model performance, but poorly defined intervals may reduce map granularity. Compared to dividing into 5 bins, binning into 10 intervals strikes an optimal balance, preserving data characteristics and surpassing raw data in predictive modelling efficacy.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-LAM: Probabilistic Limited Area Weather Forecasting with Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning methods have been shown to be effective for weather forecasting, based on the speed and accuracy compared to traditional numerical models. While early efforts primarily concentrated on deterministic predictions, the field has increasingly shifted toward probabilistic forecasting to better capture the forecast uncertainty. Most machine learning-based models have been designed for global-scale predictions, with only limited work targeting regional or limited area forecasting, which allows more specialized and flexible modeling for specific locations. This work introduces Diffusion-LAM, a probabilistic limited area weather model leveraging conditional diffusion. By conditioning on boundary data from surrounding regions, our approach generates forecasts within a defined area. Experimental results on the MEPS limited area dataset demonstrate the potential of Diffusion-LAM to deliver accurate probabilistic forecasts, highlighting its promise for limited-area weather prediction.</description>

      <title>TransMLA: Multi-Head Latent Attention Is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) often encounter communication bottlenecks on current hardware, rather than purely computational constraints. Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) tackles this challenge by using low-rank matrices in the key-value (KV) layers, thereby allowing compressed latent KV states to be cached. This approach significantly reduces the KV cache size relative to traditional multi-head attention, leading to faster inference. Moreover, MLA employs an up-projection matrix to increase expressiveness, trading additional computation for reduced communication overhead. Although MLA has demonstrated efficiency and effectiveness in Deepseek V2/V3/R1, many major model providers still rely on Group Query Attention (GQA) and have not announced any plans to adopt MLA. In this paper, we show that GQA can always be represented by MLA while maintaining the same KV cache overhead, but the converse does not hold. To encourage broader use of MLA, we introduce TransMLA, a post-training method that converts widely used GQA-based pre-trained models (e.g., LLaMA, Qwen, Mixtral) into MLA-based models. After conversion, the model can undergo additional training to boost expressiveness without increasing the KV cache size. Furthermore, we plan to develop MLA-specific inference acceleration techniques to preserve low latency in transformed models, thus enabling more efficient distillation of Deepseek R1.</description>

      <title>Toward Universal Laws of Outlier Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) admits a principled way to quantify outliers in terms of so-called randomness deficiency. For the probability distribution generated by a causal Bayesian network, we show that the randomness deficiency of the joint state decomposes into randomness deficiencies of each causal mechanism, subject to the Independence of Mechanisms Principle. Accordingly, anomalous joint observations can be quantitatively attributed to their root causes, i.e., the mechanisms that behaved anomalously. As an extension of Levin's law of randomness conservation, we show that weak outliers cannot cause strong ones when Independence of Mechanisms holds. We show how these information theoretic laws provide a better understanding of the behaviour of outliers defined with respect to existing scores.</description>

      <title>Rhythmic sharing: A bio-inspired paradigm for zero-shot adaptation and learning in neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The brain can rapidly adapt to new contexts and learn from limited data, a coveted characteristic that artificial intelligence algorithms have struggled to mimic. Inspired by oscillatory rhythms of the mechanical structures of neural cells, we developed a learning paradigm that is based on oscillations in link strengths and associates learning with the coordination of these oscillations. We find that this paradigm yields rapid adaptation and learning in artificial neural networks. Link oscillations can rapidly change coordination, endowing the network with the ability to sense subtle context changes in an unsupervised manner. In other words, the network generates the missing contextual tokens required to perform as a generalist AI architecture capable of predicting dynamics in multiple contexts. Oscillations also allow the network to extrapolate dynamics to never-seen-before contexts. These capabilities make our learning paradigm a powerful starting point for novel models of learning and cognition. Furthermore, learning through link coordination is agnostic to the specifics of the neural network architecture, hence our study opens the door for introducing rapid adaptation and learning capabilities into leading AI models.</description>

Abstract: Machine-generated artworks are now part of the contemporary art scene: they are attracting significant investments and they are presented in exhibitions together with those created by human artists. These artworks are mainly based on generative deep learning techniques, which have seen a formidable development and remarkable refinement in the very recent years. Given the inherent characteristics of these techniques, a series of novel legal problems arise. In this article, we consider a set of key questions in the area of generative deep learning for the arts, including the following: is it possible to use copyrighted works as training set for generative models? How do we legally store their copies in order to perform the training process? Who (if someone) will own the copyright on the generated data? We try to answer these questions considering the law in force in both the United States of America and the European Union, and potential future alternatives. We then extend our analysis to code generation, which is an emerging area of generative deep learning. Finally, we also formulate a set of practical guidelines for artists and developers working on deep learning generated art, as well as some policy suggestions for policymakers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.04284v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Rademacher complexity-based approach can generate non-vacuous generalisation bounds on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classifying a small number of classes of images. The development of new contraction lemmas for high-dimensional mappings between vector spaces for general Lipschitz activation functions is a key technical contribution. These lemmas extend and improve the Talagrand contraction lemma in a variety of cases. Our generalisation bound can improve Golowich et al. for ReLU DNNs. Furthermore, while prior works that use the Rademacher complexity-based approach primarily focus on ReLU DNNs, our results extend to a broader class of activation functions.</description>

      <title>Differentiating Student Feedbacks for Knowledge Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) is a crucial task in computer-aided education and intelligent tutoring systems, predicting students' performance on new questions from their responses to prior ones. An accurate KT model can capture a student's mastery level of different knowledge topics, as reflected in their predicted performance on different questions. This helps improve the learning efficiency by suggesting appropriate new questions that complement students' knowledge states. However, current KT models have significant drawbacks that they neglect the imbalanced discrimination of historical responses. A significant proportion of question responses provide limited information for discerning students' knowledge mastery, such as those that demonstrate uniform performance across different students. Optimizing the prediction of these cases may increase overall KT accuracy, but also negatively impact the model's ability to trace personalized knowledge states, especially causing a deceptive surge of performance. Towards this end, we propose a framework to reweight the contribution of different responses based on their discrimination in training. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive predictive score fusion technique to maintain accuracy on less discriminative responses, achieving proper balance between student knowledge mastery and question difficulty. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enhances the performance of three mainstream KT methods on three widely-used datasets.</description>

      <title>Global Convergence Rate of Deep Equilibrium Models with General Activations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05797v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Ling et al. investigated the over-parametrized Deep Equilibrium Model (DEQ) with ReLU activation. They proved that the gradient descent converges to a globally optimal solution at a linear convergence rate for the quadratic loss function. This paper shows that this fact still holds for DEQs with any general activation that has bounded first and second derivatives. Since the new activation function is generally non-homogeneous, bounding the least eigenvalue of the Gram matrix of the equilibrium point is particularly challenging. To accomplish this task, we need to create a novel population Gram matrix and develop a new form of dual activation with Hermite polynomial expansion.</description>

      <title>On the Importance of Backbone to the Adversarial Robustness of Object Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Object detection is a critical component of various security-sensitive applications, such as autonomous driving and video surveillance. However, existing object detectors are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which poses a significant challenge to their reliability and security. Through experiments, first, we found that existing works on improving the adversarial robustness of object detectors give a false sense of security. Second, we found that adversarially pre-trained backbone networks were essential for enhancing the adversarial robustness of object detectors. We then proposed a simple yet effective recipe for fast adversarial fine-tuning on object detectors with adversarially pre-trained backbones. Without any modifications to the structure of object detectors, our recipe achieved significantly better adversarial robustness than previous works. Finally, we explored the potential of different modern object detector designs for improving adversarial robustness with our recipe and demonstrated interesting findings, which inspired us to design state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust detectors. Our empirical results set a new milestone for adversarially robust object detection. Code and trained checkpoints are available at https://github.com/thu-ml/oddefense.</description>

      <title>Combating Confirmation Bias: A Unified Pseudo-Labeling Framework for Entity Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entity alignment (EA) aims at identifying equivalent entity pairs across different knowledge graphs (KGs) that refer to the same real-world identity. To systematically combat confirmation bias for pseudo-labeling-based entity alignment, we propose a Unified Pseudo-Labeling framework for Entity Alignment (UPL-EA) that explicitly eliminates pseudo-labeling errors to boost the accuracy of entity alignment. UPL-EA consists of two complementary components: (1) The Optimal Transport (OT)-based pseudo-labeling uses discrete OT modeling as an effective means to enable more accurate determination of entity correspondences across two KGs and to mitigate the adverse impact of erroneous matches. A simple but highly effective criterion is further devised to derive pseudo-labeled entity pairs that satisfy one-to-one correspondences at each iteration. (2) The cross-iteration pseudo-label calibration operates across multiple consecutive iterations to further improve the pseudo-labeling precision rate by reducing the local pseudo-label selection variability with a theoretical guarantee. The two components are respectively designed to eliminate Type I and Type II pseudo-labeling errors identified through our analyse. The calibrated pseudo-labels are thereafter used to augment prior alignment seeds to reinforce subsequent model training for alignment inference. The effectiveness of UPL-EA in eliminating pseudo-labeling errors is both theoretically supported and experimentally validated. The experimental results show that our approach achieves competitive performance with limited prior alignment seeds.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Context-Enhanced Relational Joins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collecting data, extracting value, and combining insights from relational and context-rich multi-modal sources in data processing pipelines presents a challenge for traditional relational DBMS. While relational operators allow declarative and optimizable query specification, they are limited to data transformations unsuitable for capturing or analyzing context. On the other hand, representation learning models can map context-rich data into embeddings, allowing machine-automated context processing but requiring imperative data transformation integration with the analytical query. To bridge this dichotomy, we present a context-enhanced relational join and introduce an embedding operator composable with relational operators. This enables hybrid relational and context-rich vector data processing, with algebraic equivalences compatible with relational algebra and corresponding logical and physical optimizations. We investigate model-operator interaction with vector data processing and study the characteristics of the E-join operator. Using an example of string embeddings, we demonstrate enabling hybrid context-enhanced processing on relational join operators with vector embeddings. The importance of holistic optimization, from logical to physical, is demonstrated in an order of magnitude execution time improvement.</description>

      <title>Hallucination is Inevitable: An Innate Limitation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hallucination has been widely recognized to be a significant drawback for large language models (LLMs). There have been many works that attempt to reduce the extent of hallucination. These efforts have mostly been empirical so far, which cannot answer the fundamental question whether it can be completely eliminated. In this paper, we formalize the problem and show that it is impossible to eliminate hallucination in LLMs. Specifically, we define a formal world where hallucination is defined as inconsistencies between a computable LLM and a computable ground truth function. By employing results from learning theory, we show that LLMs cannot learn all the computable functions and will therefore inevitably hallucinate if used as general problem solvers. Since the formal world is a part of the real world which is much more complicated, hallucinations are also inevitable for real world LLMs. Furthermore, for real world LLMs constrained by provable time complexity, we describe the hallucination-prone tasks and empirically validate our claims. Finally, using the formal world framework, we discuss the possible mechanisms and efficacies of existing hallucination mitigators as well as the practical implications on the safe deployment of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Vision-LLMs Can Fool Themselves with Self-Generated Typographic Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Typographic attacks, adding misleading text to images, can deceive vision-language models (LVLMs). The susceptibility of recent large LVLMs like GPT4-V to such attacks is understudied, raising concerns about amplified misinformation in personal assistant applications. Previous attacks use simple strategies, such as random misleading words, which don't fully exploit LVLMs' language reasoning abilities. We introduce an experimental setup for testing typographic attacks on LVLMs and propose two novel self-generated attacks: (1) Class-based attacks, where the model identifies a similar class to deceive itself, and (2) Reasoned attacks, where an advanced LVLM suggests an attack combining a deceiving class and description. Our experiments show these attacks significantly reduce classification performance by up to 60\% and are effective across different models, including InstructBLIP and MiniGPT4.

Abstract: What does it take to build mobile manipulation systems that can competently operate on previously unseen objects in previously unseen environments? This work answers this question using opening of articulated objects as a mobile manipulation testbed. Specifically, our focus is on the end-to-end performance on this task without any privileged information, i.e. the robot starts at a location with the novel target articulated object in view, and has to approach the object and successfully open it. We first develop a system for this task, and then conduct 100+ end-to-end system tests across 13 real world test sites. Our large-scale study reveals a number of surprising findings: a) modular systems outperform end-to-end learned systems for this task, even when the end-to-end learned systems are trained on 1000+ demonstrations, b) perception, and not precise end-effector control, is the primary bottleneck to task success, and c) state-of-the-art articulation parameter estimation models developed in isolation struggle when faced with robot-centric viewpoints. Overall, our findings highlight the limitations of developing components of the pipeline in isolation and underscore the need for system-level research, providing a pragmatic roadmap for building generalizable mobile manipulation systems.

      <title>Sequential Binary Classification for Intrusion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have become increasingly important as networks become more vulnerable to new and sophisticated attacks. Machine Learning (ML)-based IDS are increasingly seen as the most effective approach to handle this issue. However, IDS datasets suffer from high class imbalance, which impacts the performance of standard ML models. Different from existing data-driven techniques to handling class imbalance, this paper explores a structural approach to handling class imbalance in multi-class classification (MCC) problems. The proposed approach - Sequential Binary Classification (SBC), is a hierarchical cascade of (regular) binary classifiers. Experiments on benchmark IDS datasets demonstrate that the structural approach to handling class-imbalance, as exemplified by SBC, is a viable approach to handling the issue.</description>

      <title>On the relation between trainability and dequantization of variational quantum learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quest for successful variational quantum machine learning (QML) relies on the design of suitable parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs), as analogues to neural networks in classical machine learning. Successful QML models must fulfill the properties of trainability and non-dequantization, among others. Recent works have highlighted an intricate interplay between trainability and dequantization of such models, which is still unresolved. In this work we contribute to this debate from the perspective of machine learning, proving a number of results identifying, among others when trainability and non-dequantization are not mutually exclusive. We begin by providing a number of new somewhat broader definitions of the relevant concepts, compared to what is found in other literature, which are operationally motivated, and consistent with prior art. With these precise definitions given and motivated, we then study the relation between trainability and dequantization of variational QML. Next, we also discuss the degrees of "variationalness" of QML models, where we distinguish between models like the hardware efficient ansatz and quantum kernel methods. Finally, we introduce recipes for building PQC-based QML models which are both trainable and nondequantizable, and corresponding to different degrees of variationalness. We do not address the practical utility for such models. Our work however does point toward a way forward for finding more general constructions, for which finding applications may become feasible.</description>

      <title>Improved Algorithms for Contextual Dynamic Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contextual dynamic pricing, a seller sequentially prices goods based on contextual information. Buyers will purchase products only if the prices are below their valuations. The goal of the seller is to design a pricing strategy that collects as much revenue as possible. We focus on two different valuation models. The first assumes that valuations linearly depend on the context and are further distorted by noise. Under minor regularity assumptions, our algorithm achieves an optimal regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$, improving the existing results. The second model removes the linearity assumption, requiring only that the expected buyer valuation is $\beta$-H\"older in the context. For this model, our algorithm obtains a regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{d+2\beta/d+3\beta})$, where $d$ is the dimension of the context space.</description>

      <title>A fast neural hybrid Newton solver adapted to implicit methods for nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of implicit time-stepping schemes for the numerical approximation of solutions to stiff nonlinear time-evolution equations brings well-known advantages including, typically, better stability behaviour and corresponding support of larger time steps, and better structure preservation properties. However, this comes at the price of having to solve a nonlinear equation at every time step of the numerical scheme. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning based hybrid Newton's method to accelerate this solution of the nonlinear time step system for stiff time-evolution nonlinear equations. We propose a targeted learning strategy which facilitates robust unsupervised learning in an offline phase and provides a highly efficient initialisation for the Newton iteration leading to consistent acceleration of Newton's method. A quantifiable rate of improvement in Newton's method achieved by improved initialisation is provided and we analyse the upper bound of the generalisation error of our unsupervised learning strategy. These theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical results, demonstrating the efficiency of our proposed neural hybrid solver both in one- and two-dimensional cases.</description>

      <title>Geospatial Trajectory Generation via Efficient Abduction: Deployment for Independent Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to generate artificial human movement patterns while meeting location and time constraints is an important problem in the security community, particularly as it enables the study of the analog problem of detecting such patterns while maintaining privacy.  We frame this problem as an instance of abduction guided by a novel parsimony function represented as an aggregate truth value over an annotated logic program.  This approach has the added benefit of affording explainability to an analyst user.  By showing that any subset of such a program can provide a lower bound on this parsimony requirement, we are able to abduce movement trajectories efficiently through an informed (i.e., A*) search.  We describe how our implementation was enhanced with the application of multiple techniques in order to be scaled and integrated with a cloud-based software stack that included bottom-up rule learning, geolocated knowledge graph retrieval/management, and interfaces with government systems for independently conducted government-run tests for which we provide results.  We also report on our own experiments showing that we not only provide exact results but also scale to very large scenarios and provide realistic agent trajectories that can go undetected by machine learning anomaly detectors.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Normality of Generalized Low-Rank Matrix Sensing via Riemannian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an asymptotic normality guarantee for generalized low-rank matrix sensing -- i.e., matrix sensing under a general convex loss $\bar\ell(\langle X,M\rangle,y^*)$, where $M\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$ is the unknown rank-$k$ matrix, $X$ is a measurement matrix, and $y^*$ is the corresponding measurement. Our analysis relies on tools from Riemannian geometry to handle degeneracy of the Hessian of the loss due to rotational symmetry in the parameter space. In particular, we parameterize the manifold of low-rank matrices by $\bar\theta\bar\theta^\top$, where $\bar\theta\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times k}$. Then, assuming the minimizer of the empirical loss $\bar\theta^0\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times k}$ is in a constant size ball around the true parameters $\bar\theta^*$, we prove $\sqrt{n}(\phi^0-\phi^*)\xrightarrow{D}N(0,(H^*)^{-1})$ as $n\to\infty$, where $\phi^0$ and $\phi^*$ are representations of $\bar\theta^*$ and $\bar\theta^0$ in the horizontal space of the Riemannian quotient manifold $\mathbb{R}^{d\times k}/\text{O}(k)$, and $H^*$ is the Hessian of the true loss in the same representation.</description>

      <title>What can Large Language Models Capture about Code Functional Equivalence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Code-LLMs, LLMs pre-trained on large code corpora, have shown great progress in learning rich representations of the structure and syntax of code, successfully using it to generate or classify code fragments. At the same time, understanding if they are able to do so because they capture code semantics, and how well, is still an open question. In this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing SeqCoBench, a benchmark for systematically assessing how Code-LLMs can capture code functional equivalence. SeqCoBench contains over 20 code transformations that either preserve or alter the semantics of Python programs. We conduct extensive evaluations in different settings, including zero-shot and parameter-efficient finetuning methods on state-of-the-art (Code)-LLMs to see if they can discern semantically equivalent or different pairs of programs in SeqCoBench. We find that the performance gap between these LLMs and classical match-based retrieval scores is minimal, with both approaches showing a concerning lack of depth in understanding code semantics.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Modeling of Combined Sewer Systems for Urban Sustainability: An Empirical Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate change poses complex challenges, with extreme weather events becoming increasingly frequent and difficult to model. Examples include the dynamics of Combined Sewer Systems (CSS). Overburdened CSS during heavy rainfall will overflow untreated wastewater into surface water bodies. Classical approaches to modeling the impact of extreme rainfall events rely on physical simulations, which are particularly challenging to create for large urban infrastructures. Deep Learning (DL) models offer a cost-effective alternative for modeling the complex dynamics of sewer systems. In this study, we present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of several state-of-the-art DL time series models for predicting sewer system dynamics in a large urban infrastructure, utilizing three years of measurement data. We especially investigate the potential of DL models to maintain predictive precision during network outages by comparing global models, which have access to all variables within the sewer system, and local models, which are limited to data from a restricted set of local sensors. Our findings demonstrate that DL models can accurately predict the dynamics of sewer system load, even under network outage conditions. These results suggest that DL models can effectively aid in balancing the load redistribution in CSS, thereby enhancing the sustainability and resilience of urban infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Two Stage Segmentation of Cervical Tumors using PocketNet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cervical cancer remains the fourth most common malignancy amongst women worldwide.1 Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) serves as the mainstay definitive treatment regimen for locally advanced cervical cancers and includes external beam radiation followed by brachytherapy.2 Integral to radiotherapy treatment planning is the routine contouring of both the target tumor at the level of the cervix, associated gynecologic anatomy and the adjacent organs at risk (OARs). However, manual contouring of these structures is both time and labor intensive and associated with known interobserver variability that can impact treatment outcomes. While multiple tools have been developed to automatically segment OARs and the high-risk clinical tumor volume (HR-CTV) using computed tomography (CT) images,3,4,5,6 the development of deep learning-based tumor segmentation tools using routine T2-weighted (T2w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) addresses an unmet clinical need to improve the routine contouring of both anatomical structures and cervical cancers, thereby increasing quality and consistency of radiotherapy planning. This work applied a novel deep-learning model (PocketNet) to segment the cervix, vagina, uterus, and tumor(s) on T2w MRI. The performance of the PocketNet architecture was evaluated, when trained on data via five-fold cross validation. PocketNet achieved a mean Dice-Sorensen similarity coefficient (DSC) exceeding 70% for tumor segmentation and 80% for organ segmentation. Validation on a publicly available dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) demonstrated the models robustness, achieving DSC scores of 67.3% for tumor segmentation and 80.8% for organ segmentation. These results suggest that PocketNet is robust to variations in contrast protocols, providing reliable segmentation of the regions of interest.</description>

      <title>"It Might be Technically Impressive, But It's Practically Useless to us": Motivations, Practices, Challenges, and Opportunities for Cross-Functional Collaboration around AI within the News Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, an increasing number of news organizations have integrated artificial intelligence (AI) into their workflows, leading to a further influx of AI technologists and data workers into the news industry. This has initiated cross-functional collaborations between these professionals and journalists. Although prior research has explored the impact of AI-related roles entering the news industry, there is a lack of studies on how internal cross-functional collaboration around AI unfolds between AI professionals and journalists within the news industry. Through interviews with 17 journalists, six AI technologists, and three AI workers with cross-functional experience from leading Chinese news organizations, we investigate the practices, challenges, and opportunities for internal cross-functional collaboration around AI in news industry. We first study how these journalists and AI professionals perceive existing internal cross-collaboration strategies. We explore the challenges of cross-functional collaboration and provide recommendations for enhancing future cross-functional collaboration around AI in the news industry.</description>

      <title>Theoretically Grounded Framework for LLM Watermarking: A Distribution-Adaptive Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a crucial method to distinguish AI-generated text from human-created text. In this paper, we present a novel theoretical framework for watermarking Large Language Models (LLMs) that jointly optimizes both the watermarking scheme and the detection process. Our approach focuses on maximizing detection performance while maintaining control over the worst-case Type-I error and text distortion. We characterize \emph{the universally minimum Type-II error}, showing a fundamental trade-off between watermark detectability and text distortion. Importantly, we identify that the optimal watermarking schemes are adaptive to the LLM generative distribution. Building on our theoretical insights, we propose an efficient, model-agnostic, distribution-adaptive watermarking algorithm, utilizing a surrogate model alongside the Gumbel-max trick. Experiments conducted on Llama2-13B and Mistral-8$\times$7B models confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we examine incorporating robustness into our framework, paving a way to future watermarking systems that withstand adversarial attacks more effectively.</description>

      <title>WGFormer: An SE(3)-Transformer Driven by Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Molecular Ground-State Conformation Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09795v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting molecular ground-state conformation (i.e., energy-minimized conformation) is crucial for many chemical applications such as molecular docking and property prediction. Classic energy-based simulation is time-consuming when solving this problem while existing learning-based methods have advantages in computational efficiency but sacrifice accuracy and interpretability. In this work, we propose a novel and effective method to bridge the energy-based simulation and the learning-based strategy, which designs and learns a Wasserstein gradient flow-driven SE(3)-Transformer, called WGFormer, for molecular ground-state conformation prediction. Specifically, our method tackles this task within an auto-encoding framework, which encodes low-quality conformations by the proposed WGFormer and decodes corresponding ground-state conformations by an MLP. The architecture of WGFormer corresponds to Wasserstein gradient flows -- it optimizes molecular conformations by minimizing an energy function defined on the latent mixture models of atoms, thereby significantly improving performance and interpretability. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art competitors, providing a new and insightful paradigm to predict molecular ground-state conformation.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Temporal Difference Learning with Linear Function Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical inference with finite-sample validity for the value function of a given policy in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is crucial for ensuring the reliability of reinforcement learning. Temporal Difference (TD) learning, arguably the most widely used algorithm for policy evaluation, serves as a natural framework for this purpose. In this paper, we study the consistency properties of TD learning with Polyak-Ruppert averaging and linear function approximation, and obtain three significant improvements over existing results. First, we derive a novel sharp high-dimensional probability convergence guarantee that depends explicitly on the asymptotic variance and holds under weak conditions. We further establish refined high-dimensional Berry-Esseen bounds over the class of convex sets that guarantee faster rates than those in the literature. Finally, we propose a plug-in estimator for the asymptotic covariance matrix, designed for efficient online computation. These results enable the construction of confidence regions and simultaneous confidence intervals for the linear parameters of the value function, with guaranteed finite-sample coverage. We demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Conformal Predictive Portfolio Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines portfolio selection using predictive models for portfolio returns. Portfolio selection is a fundamental task in finance, and a variety of methods have been developed to achieve this goal. For instance, the mean-variance approach constructs portfolios by balancing the trade-off between the mean and variance of asset returns, while the quantile-based approach optimizes portfolios by considering tail risk. These methods often depend on distributional information estimated from historical data using predictive models, each of which carries its own uncertainty. To address this, we propose a framework for predictive portfolio selection via conformal prediction , called \emph{Conformal Predictive Portfolio Selection} (CPPS). Our approach forecasts future portfolio returns, computes the corresponding prediction intervals, and selects the portfolio of interest based on these intervals. The framework is flexible and can accommodate a wide range of predictive models, including autoregressive (AR) models, random forests, and neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the CPPS framework by applying it to an AR model and validate its performance through empirical studies, showing that it delivers superior returns compared to simpler strategies.</description>

      <title>End-to-end Training for Recommendation with Language-based User Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in natural language-based user profiles for recommender systems, which aims to enhance transparency and scrutability compared with embedding-based methods. Existing studies primarily generate these profiles using zero-shot inference from large language models (LLMs), but their quality remains insufficient, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance. In this paper, we introduce LangPTune, the first end-to-end training framework to optimize LLM-generated user profiles. Our method significantly outperforms zero-shot approaches by explicitly training the LLM for the recommendation objective. Through extensive evaluations across diverse training configurations and benchmarks, we demonstrate that LangPTune not only surpasses zero-shot baselines but can also matches the performance of state-of-the-art embedding-based methods. Finally, we investigate whether the training procedure preserves the interpretability of these profiles compared to zero-shot inference through both GPT-4 simulations and crowdworker user studies. Implementation of LangPTune can be found at https://github.com/ZhaolinGao/LangPTune.</description>

      <title>WASP: A Weight-Space Approach to Detecting Learned Spuriousness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is of crucial importance to train machine learning models such that they clearly understand what defines each class in a given task. Though there is a sum of works dedicated to identifying the spurious correlations featured by a dataset that may impact the model's understanding of the classes, all current approaches rely solely on data or error analysis. That is, they cannot point out spurious correlations learned by the model that are not already pointed out by the counterexamples featured in the validation or training sets. We propose a method that transcends this limitation, switching the focus from analyzing a model's predictions to analyzing the model's weights, the mechanism behind the making of the decisions, which proves to be more insightful. Our proposed Weight-space Approach to detecting Spuriousness (WASP) relies on analyzing the weights of foundation models as they drift towards capturing various (spurious) correlations while being fine-tuned on a given dataset. We demonstrate that different from previous works, our method (i) can expose spurious correlations featured by a dataset even when they are not exposed by training or validation counterexamples, (ii) it works for multiple modalities such as image and text, and (iii) it can uncover previously untapped spurious correlations learned by ImageNet-1k classifiers.</description>

      <title>The LLM Language Network: A Neuroscientific Approach for Identifying Causally Task-Relevant Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities on not just language tasks, but also various tasks that are not linguistic in nature, such as logical reasoning and social inference. In the human brain, neuroscience has identified a core language system that selectively and causally supports language processing. We here ask whether similar specialization for language emerges in LLMs. We identify language-selective units within 18 popular LLMs, using the same localization approach that is used in neuroscience. We then establish the causal role of these units by demonstrating that ablating LLM language-selective units -- but not random units -- leads to drastic deficits in language tasks. Correspondingly, language-selective LLM units are more aligned to brain recordings from the human language system than random units. Finally, we investigate whether our localization method extends to other cognitive domains: while we find specialized networks in some LLMs for reasoning and social capabilities, there are substantial differences among models. These findings provide functional and causal evidence for specialization in large language models, and highlight parallels with the functional organization in the brain.</description>

      <title>AI Flow at the Network Edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12469v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants have led to remarkable progress across various domains, demonstrating impressive capabilities and unprecedented potential. In the era of ubiquitous connectivity, leveraging communication networks to distribute intelligence is a transformative concept, envisioning AI-powered services accessible at the network edge. However, pushing large models from the cloud to resource-constrained environments faces critical challenges. Model inference on low-end devices leads to excessive latency and performance bottlenecks, while raw data transmission over limited bandwidth networks causes high communication overhead. This article presents AI Flow, a framework that streamlines the inference process by jointly leveraging the heterogeneous resources available across devices, edge nodes, and cloud servers, making intelligence flow across networks. To facilitate cooperation among multiple computational nodes, the proposed framework explores a paradigm shift in the design of communication network systems from transmitting information flow to intelligence flow, where the goal of communications is task-oriented and folded into the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through an image captioning use case, showcasing the ability to reduce response latency while maintaining high-quality captions. This article serves as a position paper for identifying the motivation, challenges, and principles of AI Flow.</description>

      <title>Progressive-Resolution Policy Distillation: Leveraging Coarse-Resolution Simulations for Time-Efficient Fine-Resolution Policy Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In earthwork and construction, excavators often encounter large rocks mixed with various soil conditions, requiring skilled operators. This paper presents a framework for achieving autonomous excavation using reinforcement learning (RL) through a rock excavation simulator. In the simulation, resolution can be defined by the particle size/number in the whole soil space. Fine-resolution simulations closely mimic real-world behavior but demand significant calculation time and challenging sample collection, while coarse-resolution simulations enable faster sample collection but deviate from real-world behavior. To combine the advantages of both resolutions, we explore using policies developed in coarse-resolution simulations for pre-training in fine-resolution simulations. To this end, we propose a novel policy learning framework called Progressive-Resolution Policy Distillation (PRPD), which progressively transfers policies through some middle-resolution simulations with conservative policy transfer to avoid domain gaps that could lead to policy transfer failure. Validation in a rock excavation simulator and nine real-world rock environments demonstrated that PRPD reduced sampling time to less than 1/7 while maintaining task success rates comparable to those achieved through policy learning in a fine-resolution simulation.</description>

      <title>Beyond Non-Degeneracy: Revisiting Certainty Equivalent Heuristic for Online Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Certainty Equivalent heuristic (CE) is a widely-used algorithm for various dynamic resource allocation problems in OR and OM. Despite its popularity, existing theoretical guarantees of CE are limited to settings satisfying restrictive fluid regularity conditions, particularly, the non-degeneracy conditions, under the widely held belief that the violation of such conditions leads to performance deterioration and necessitates algorithmic innovation beyond CE.
  In this work, we conduct a refined performance analysis of CE within the general framework of online linear programming. We show that CE achieves uniformly near-optimal regret (up to a polylogarithmic factor in $T$) under only mild assumptions on the underlying distribution, without relying on any fluid regularity conditions. Our result implies that, contrary to prior belief, CE effectively beats the curse of degeneracy for a wide range of problem instances with continuous conditional reward distributions, highlighting the distinction of the problem's structure between discrete and non-discrete settings. Our explicit regret bound interpolates between the mild $(\log T)^2$ regime and the worst-case $\sqrt{T}$ regime with a parameter $\beta$ quantifying the minimal rate of probability accumulation of the conditional reward distributions, generalizing prior findings in the multisecretary setting.
  To achieve these results, we develop novel algorithmic analytical techniques. Drawing tools from the empirical processes theory, we establish strong concentration analysis of the solutions to random linear programs, leading to improved regret analysis under significantly relaxed assumptions. These techniques may find potential applications in broader online decision-making contexts.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation for Dynamic Few-shot Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text classification is a fundamental task in data mining, pivotal to various applications such as tabular understanding and recommendation. Although neural network-based models, such as CNN and BERT, have demonstrated remarkable performance in text classification, their effectiveness heavily relies on abundant labeled training data. This dependency makes these models less effective in dynamic few-shot text classification, where labeled data is scarce, and new target labels frequently appear based on application needs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their extensive pretraining and contextual understanding ability. Current approaches provide LLMs with text inputs, candidate labels, and additional side information (e.g., descriptions) to classify texts. However, their effectiveness is hindered by the increased input size and the noise introduced through side information processing. To address these limitations, we propose a graph-based online retrieval-augmented generation framework, namely GORAG, for dynamic few-shot text classification. Rather than treating each input independently, GORAG constructs and maintains a weighted graph by extracting side information across all target texts. In this graph, text keywords and labels are represented as nodes, with edges indicating the correlations between them. To model these correlations, GORAG employs an edge weighting mechanism to prioritize the importance and reliability of extracted information and dynamically retrieves relevant context using a minimum-cost spanning tree tailored for each text input. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GORAG outperforms existing approaches by providing more comprehensive and precise contextual information.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning over Ring-All-Reduce Distributed Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has gained attention as a distributed learning paradigm for its data privacy benefits and accelerated convergence through parallel computation. Traditional FL relies on a server-client (SC) architecture, where a central server coordinates multiple clients to train a global model, but this approach faces scalability challenges due to server communication bottlenecks. To overcome this, the ring-all-reduce (RAR) architecture has been introduced, eliminating the central server and achieving bandwidth optimality. However, the tightly coupled nature of RAR's ring topology exposes it to unique Byzantine attack risks not present in SC-based FL. Despite its potential, designing Byzantine-robust RAR-based FL algorithms remains an open problem. To address this gap, we propose BRACE (Byzantine-robust ring-all-reduce), the first RAR-based FL algorithm to achieve both Byzantine robustness and communication efficiency. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of BRACE under Byzantine attacks, demonstrate its bandwidth efficiency, and validate its practical effectiveness through experiments. Our work offers a foundational understanding of Byzantine-robust RAR-based FL design.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly used in government programs to identify and support the most vulnerable individuals, prioritizing assistance for those at greatest risk over optimizing aggregate outcomes. This paper examines the welfare impacts of prediction in equity-driven contexts, and how they compare to other policy levers, such as expanding bureaucratic capacity. Through mathematical models and a real-world case study on long-term unemployment amongst German residents, we develop a comprehensive understanding of the relative effectiveness of prediction in surfacing the worst-off. Our findings provide clear analytical frameworks and practical, data-driven tools that empower policymakers to make principled decisions when designing these systems.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Operator Takeover for Visuomotor Diffusion Policy Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Real-Time Operator Takeover (RTOT) paradigm enabling operators to seamlessly take control of a live visuomotor diffusion policy, guiding the system back into desirable states or reinforcing specific demonstrations. We present new insights in using the Mahalonobis distance to automatically identify undesirable states. Once the operator has intervened and redirected the system, the control is seamlessly returned to the policy, which resumes generating actions until further intervention is required. We demonstrate that incorporating the targeted takeover demonstrations significantly improves policy performance compared to training solely with an equivalent number of, but longer, initial demonstrations. We provide an in-depth analysis of using the Mahalanobis distance to detect out-of-distribution states, illustrating its utility for identifying critical failure points during execution. Supporting materials, including videos of initial and takeover demonstrations and all rice scooping experiments, are available on the project website: https://operator-takeover.github.io/</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present synthetic data generation framework for flood hazard detection system. For high fidelity and quality, we characterize several real-world properties into virtual world and simulate the flood situation by controlling them. For the sake of efficiency, recent generative models in image-to-3D and urban city synthesis are leveraged to easily composite flood environments so that we avoid data bias due to the hand-crafted manner. Based on our framework, we build the flood synthetic dataset with 5 levels, dubbed MultiFloodSynth which contains rich annotation types like normal map, segmentation, 3D bounding box for a variety of downstream task. In experiments, our dataset demonstrate the enhanced performance of flood hazard detection with on-par realism compared with real dataset.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Medical Code Tokenizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models trained on patient electronic health records (EHRs) require tokenizing medical data into sequences of discrete vocabulary items. Existing tokenizers treat medical codes from EHRs as isolated textual tokens. However, each medical code is defined by its textual description, its position in ontological hierarchies, and its relationships to other codes, such as disease co-occurrences and drug-treatment associations. Medical vocabularies contain more than 600,000 codes with critical information for clinical reasoning. We introduce MedTok, a multimodal medical code tokenizer that uses the text descriptions and relational context of codes. MedTok processes text using a language model encoder and encodes the relational structure with a graph encoder. It then quantizes both modalities into a unified token space, preserving modality-specific and cross-modality information. We integrate MedTok into five EHR models and evaluate it on operational and clinical tasks across in-patient and out-patient datasets, including outcome prediction, diagnosis classification, drug recommendation, and risk stratification. Swapping standard EHR tokenizers with MedTok improves AUPRC across all EHR models, by 4.10% on MIMIC-III, 4.78% on MIMIC-IV, and 11.30% on EHRShot, with the largest gains in drug recommendation. Beyond EHR modeling, we demonstrate using MedTok tokenizer with medical QA systems. Our results demonstrate the potential of MedTok as a unified tokenizer for medical codes, improving tokenization for medical foundation models.</description>

      <title>Tighter sparse variational Gaussian processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse variational Gaussian process (GP) approximations based on inducing points have become the de facto standard for scaling GPs to large datasets, owing to their theoretical elegance, computational efficiency, and ease of implementation. This paper introduces a provably tighter variational approximation by relaxing the standard assumption that the conditional approximate posterior given the inducing points must match that in the prior. The key innovation is to modify the conditional posterior to have smaller variances than that of the prior at the training points. We derive the collapsed bound for the regression case, describe how to use the proposed approximation in large data settings, and discuss its application to handle orthogonally structured inducing points and GP latent variable models. Extensive experiments on regression benchmarks, classification, and latent variable models demonstrate that the proposed approximation consistently matches or outperforms standard sparse variational GPs while maintaining the same computational cost. An implementation will be made available in all popular GP packages.</description>

      <title>Temporal Representation Alignment: Successor Features Enable Emergent Compositionality in Robot Instruction Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective task representations should facilitate compositionality, such that after learning a variety of basic tasks, an agent can perform compound tasks consisting of multiple steps simply by composing the representations of the constituent steps together. While this is conceptually simple and appealing, it is not clear how to automatically learn representations that enable this sort of compositionality. We show that learning to associate the representations of current and future states with a temporal alignment loss can improve compositional generalization, even in the absence of any explicit subtask planning or reinforcement learning. We evaluate our approach across diverse robotic manipulation tasks as well as in simulation, showing substantial improvements for tasks specified with either language or goal images.</description>

      <title>Mix Data or Merge Models? Balancing the Helpfulness, Honesty, and Harmlessness of Large Language Model via Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving balanced alignment of large language models (LLMs) in terms of Helpfulness, Honesty, and Harmlessness (3H optimization) constitutes a cornerstone of responsible AI, with existing methods like data mixture strategies facing limitations including reliance on expert knowledge and conflicting optimization signals. While model merging offers a promising alternative by integrating specialized models, its potential for 3H optimization remains underexplored. This paper establishes the first comprehensive benchmark for model merging in 3H-aligned LLMs, systematically evaluating 15 methods (12 training-free merging and 3 data mixture techniques) across 10 datasets associated with 5 annotation dimensions, 2 LLM families, and 2 training paradigms. Our analysis reveals three pivotal insights: (i) previously overlooked collaborative/conflicting relationships among 3H dimensions, (ii) the consistent superiority of model merging over data mixture approaches in balancing alignment trade-offs, and (iii) the critical role of parameter-level conflict resolution through redundant component pruning and outlier mitigation. Building on these findings, we propose R-TSVM, a Reweighting-enhanced Task Singular Vector Merging method that incorporates outlier-aware parameter weighting and sparsity-adaptive rank selection strategies adapted to the heavy-tailed parameter distribution and sparsity for LLMs, further improving LLM alignment across multiple evaluations. We release our trained models for further exploration.</description>

      <title>A Simple yet Effective DDG Predictor is An Unsupervised Antibody Optimizer and Explainer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proteins that exist today have been optimized over billions of years of natural evolution, during which nature creates random mutations and selects them. The discovery of functionally promising mutations is challenged by the limited evolutionary accessible regions, i.e., only a small region on the fitness landscape is beneficial. There have been numerous priors used to constrain protein evolution to regions of landscapes with high-fitness variants, among which the change in binding free energy (DDG) of protein complexes upon mutations is one of the most commonly used priors. However, the huge mutation space poses two challenges: (1) how to improve the efficiency of DDG prediction for fast mutation screening; and (2) how to explain mutation preferences and efficiently explore accessible evolutionary regions. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight DDG predictor (Light-DDG), which adopts a structure-aware Transformer as the backbone and enhances it by knowledge distilled from existing powerful but computationally heavy DDG predictors. Additionally, we augmented, annotated, and released a large-scale dataset containing millions of mutation data for pre-training Light-DDG. We find that such a simple yet effective Light-DDG can serve as a good unsupervised antibody optimizer and explainer. For the target antibody, we propose a novel Mutation Explainer to learn mutation preferences, which accounts for the marginal benefit of each mutation per residue. To further explore accessible evolutionary regions, we conduct preference-guided antibody optimization and evaluate antibody candidates quickly using Light-DDG to identify desirable mutations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Confidence: Adaptive Abstention in Dual-Threshold Conformal Prediction for Autonomous System Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safety-critical perception systems require both reliable uncertainty quantification and principled abstention mechanisms to maintain safety under diverse operational conditions. We present a novel dual-threshold conformalization framework that provides statistically-guaranteed uncertainty estimates while enabling selective prediction in high-risk scenarios. Our approach uniquely combines a conformal threshold ensuring valid prediction sets with an abstention threshold optimized through ROC analysis, providing distribution-free coverage guarantees (&gt;= 1 - alpha) while identifying unreliable predictions. Through comprehensive evaluation on CIFAR-100, ImageNet1K, and ModelNet40 datasets, we demonstrate superior robustness across camera and LiDAR modalities under varying environmental perturbations. The framework achieves exceptional detection performance (AUC: 0.993 to 0.995) under severe conditions while maintaining high coverage (&gt;90.0%) and enabling adaptive abstention (13.5% to 63.4% +/- 0.5) as environmental severity increases. For LiDAR-based perception, our approach demonstrates particularly strong performance, maintaining robust coverage (&gt;84.5%) while appropriately abstaining from unreliable predictions. Notably, the framework shows remarkable stability under heavy perturbations, with detection performance (AUC: 0.995 +/- 0.001) significantly outperforming existing methods across all modalities. Our unified approach bridges the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical deployment needs, offering a robust solution for safety-critical autonomous systems operating in challenging real-world conditions.</description>

      <title>MRS: A Fast Sampler for Mean Reverting Diffusion based on ODE and SDE Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In applications of diffusion models, controllable generation is of practical significance, but is also challenging. Current methods for controllable generation primarily focus on modifying the score function of diffusion models, while Mean Reverting (MR) Diffusion directly modifies the structure of the stochastic differential equation (SDE), making the incorporation of image conditions simpler and more natural. However, current training-free fast samplers are not directly applicable to MR Diffusion. And thus MR Diffusion requires hundreds of NFEs (number of function evaluations) to obtain high-quality samples. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named MRS (MR Sampler) to reduce the sampling NFEs of MR Diffusion. We solve the reverse-time SDE and the probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) associated with MR Diffusion, and derive semi-analytical solutions. The solutions consist of an analytical function and an integral parameterized by a neural network. Based on this solution, we can generate high-quality samples in fewer steps. Our approach does not require training and supports all mainstream parameterizations, including noise prediction, data prediction and velocity prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR Sampler maintains high sampling quality with a speedup of 10 to 20 times across ten different image restoration tasks. Our algorithm accelerates the sampling procedure of MR Diffusion, making it more practical in controllable generation.</description>

      <title>Better Embeddings with Coupled Adam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs learn word representations that exhibit the undesirable yet poorly understood feature of anisotropy. In this paper, we argue that the second moment in Adam is a cause of anisotropic embeddings, and suggest a modified optimizer called Coupled Adam to mitigate the problem. Our experiments demonstrate that Coupled Adam significantly improves the quality of embeddings, while also leading to better upstream and downstream performance on large enough datasets.</description>
