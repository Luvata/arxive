      <title>Towards Probabilistic Planning of Explanations for Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In robotics, ensuring that autonomous systems are comprehensible and accountable to users is essential for effective human-robot interaction. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates user-centered design principles directly into the core of robot path planning processes. We propose a probabilistic framework for automated planning of explanations for robot navigation, where the preferences of different users regarding explanations are probabilistically modeled to tailor the stochasticity of the real-world human-robot interaction and the communication of decisions of the robot and its actions towards humans. This approach aims to enhance the transparency of robot path planning and adapt to diverse user explanation needs by anticipating the types of explanations that will satisfy individual users.</description>

      <title>Deep Heuristic Learning for Real-Time Urban Pathfinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to urban pathfinding by transforming traditional heuristic-based algorithms into deep learning models that leverage real-time contextual data, such as traffic and weather conditions. We propose two methods: an enhanced A* algorithm that dynamically adjusts routes based on current environmental conditions, and a neural network model that predicts the next optimal path segment using historical and live data. An extensive benchmark was conducted to compare the performance of different deep learning models, including MLP, GRU, LSTM, Autoencoders, and Transformers. Both methods were evaluated in a simulated urban environment in Berlin, with the neural network model outperforming traditional methods, reducing travel times by up to 40%, while the enhanced A* algorithm achieved a 34% improvement. These results demonstrate the potential of deep learning to optimize urban navigation in real time, providing more adaptable and efficient routing solutions.</description>

      <title>PadChest-GR: A Bilingual Chest X-ray Dataset for Grounded Radiology Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to create free-text radiology reports from clinical imaging. Grounded radiology report generation (GRRG) extends RRG by including the localisation of individual findings on the image. Currently, there are no manually annotated chest X-ray (CXR) datasets to train GRRG models. In this work, we present a dataset called PadChest-GR (Grounded-Reporting) derived from PadChest aimed at training GRRG models for CXR images. We curate a public bi-lingual dataset of 4,555 CXR studies with grounded reports (3,099 abnormal and 1,456 normal), each containing complete lists of sentences describing individual present (positive) and absent (negative) findings in English and Spanish. In total, PadChest-GR contains 7,037 positive and 3,422 negative finding sentences. Every positive finding sentence is associated with up to two independent sets of bounding boxes labelled by different readers and has categorical labels for finding type, locations, and progression. To the best of our knowledge, PadChest-GR is the first manually curated dataset designed to train GRRG models for understanding and interpreting radiological images and generated text. By including detailed localization and comprehensive annotations of all clinically relevant findings, it provides a valuable resource for developing and evaluating GRRG models from CXR images. PadChest-GR can be downloaded under request from https://bimcv.cipf.es/bimcv-projects/padchest-gr/</description>

      <title>Discern-XR: An Online Classifier for Metaverse Network Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we design an exclusive Metaverse network traffic classifier, named Discern-XR, to help Internet service providers (ISP) and router manufacturers enhance the quality of Metaverse services. Leveraging segmented learning, the Frame Vector Representation (FVR) algorithm and Frame Identification Algorithm (FIA) are proposed to extract critical frame-related statistics from raw network data having only four application-level features. A novel Augmentation, Aggregation, and Retention Online Training (A2R-OT) algorithm is proposed to find an accurate classification model through online training methodology. In addition, we contribute to the real-world Metaverse dataset comprising virtual reality (VR) games, VR video, VR chat, augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) traffic, providing a comprehensive benchmark. Discern-XR outperforms state-of-the-art classifiers by 7% while improving training efficiency and reducing false-negative rates. Our work advances Metaverse network traffic classification by standing as the state-of-the-art solution.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI through a Democratic Lens: DhondtXAI for Proportional Feature Importance Using the D'Hondt Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In democratic societies, electoral systems play a crucial role in translating public preferences into political representation. Among these, the D'Hondt method is widely used to ensure proportional representation, balancing fair representation with governmental stability. Recently, there has been a growing interest in applying similar principles of proportional representation to enhance interpretability in machine learning, specifically in Explainable AI (XAI). This study investigates the integration of D'Hondt-based voting principles in the DhondtXAI method, which leverages resource allocation concepts to interpret feature importance within AI models. Through a comparison of SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) and DhondtXAI, we evaluate their effectiveness in feature attribution within CatBoost and XGBoost models for breast cancer and diabetes prediction, respectively. The DhondtXAI approach allows for alliance formation and thresholding to enhance interpretability, representing feature importance as seats in a parliamentary view. Statistical correlation analyses between SHAP values and DhondtXAI allocations support the consistency of interpretations, demonstrating DhondtXAI's potential as a complementary tool for understanding feature importance in AI models. The results highlight that integrating electoral principles, such as proportional representation and alliances, into AI explainability can improve user understanding, especially in high-stakes fields like healthcare.</description>

      <title>Alopex: A Computational Framework for Enabling On-Device Function Calls with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their increased integration into mobile devices for personalized assistance, which enables LLMs to call external API functions to enhance their performance. However, challenges such as data scarcity, ineffective question formatting, and catastrophic forgetting hinder the development of on-device LLM agents. To tackle these issues, we propose Alopex, a framework that enables precise on-device function calls using the Fox LLM. Alopex introduces a logic-based method for generating high-quality training data and a novel ``description-question-output'' format for fine-tuning, reducing risks of function information leakage. Additionally, a data mixing strategy is used to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, combining function call data with textbook datasets to enhance performance in various tasks. Experimental results show that Alopex improves function call accuracy and significantly reduces catastrophic forgetting, providing a robust solution for integrating function call capabilities into LLMs without manual intervention.</description>

      <title>Minimal Conditions for Beneficial Neighbourhood Search and Local Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates what properties a neighbourhood requires to support beneficial local search. We show that neighbourhood locality, and a reduction in cost probability towards the optimum, support a proof that search among neighbours is more likely to find an improving solution in a single search step than blind search. This is the first paper to introduce such a proof. The concepts underlying these properties are illustrated on a satisfiability problem class, and on travelling salesman problems. Secondly, for a given cost target t, we investigate a combination of blind search and local descent termed local blind descent, and present various conditions under which the expected number of steps to reach a cost better than t using local blind descent, is proven to be smaller than with blind search. Experiments indicate that local blind descent, given target cost t, should switch to local descent at a starting cost that reduces as t approaches the optimum.</description>

      <title>A Taxonomy of AgentOps for Enabling Observability of Foundation Model based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-improving quality of LLMs has fueled the growth of a diverse range of downstream tasks, leading to an increased demand for AI automation and a burgeoning interest in developing foundation model (FM)-based autonomous agents. As AI agent systems tackle more complex tasks and evolve, they involve a wider range of stakeholders, including agent users, agentic system developers and deployers, and AI model developers. These systems also integrate multiple components such as AI agent workflows, RAG pipelines, prompt management, agent capabilities, and observability features. In this case, obtaining reliable outputs and answers from these agents remains challenging, necessitating a dependable execution process and end-to-end observability solutions. To build reliable AI agents and LLM applications, it is essential to shift towards designing AgentOps platforms that ensure observability and traceability across the entire development-to-production life-cycle. To this end, we conducted a rapid review and identified relevant AgentOps tools from the agentic ecosystem. Based on this review, we provide an overview of the essential features of AgentOps and propose a comprehensive overview of observability data/traceable artifacts across the agent production life-cycle. Our findings provide a systematic overview of the current AgentOps landscape, emphasizing the critical role of observability/traceability in enhancing the reliability of autonomous agent systems.</description>

      <title>LLM-PySC2: Starcraft II learning environment for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new environment LLM-PySC2 (the Large Language Model StarCraft II Learning Environment), a platform derived from DeepMind's StarCraft II Learning Environment that serves to develop Large Language Models (LLMs) based decision-making methodologies. This environment is the first to offer the complete StarCraft II action space, multi-modal observation interfaces, and a structured game knowledge database, which are seamlessly connected with various LLMs to facilitate the research of LLMs-based decision-making. To further support multi-agent research, we developed an LLM collaborative framework that supports multi-agent concurrent queries and multi-agent communication. In our experiments, the LLM-PySC2 environment is adapted to be compatible with the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) task group and provided eight new scenarios focused on macro-decision abilities. We evaluated nine mainstream LLMs in the experiments, and results show that sufficient parameters are necessary for LLMs to make decisions, but improving reasoning ability does not directly lead to better decision-making outcomes. Our findings further indicate the importance of enabling large models to learn autonomously in the deployment environment through parameter training or train-free learning techniques. Ultimately, we expect that the LLM-PySC2 environment can promote research on learning methods for LLMs, helping LLM-based methods better adapt to task scenarios.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Diagram of Thought (DoT) have enabled the creation of autonomous intelligent systems capable of performing cluster diagnostics and troubleshooting. By integrating these technologies with self-play methodologies, we have developed an LLM-agent system designed to autonomously diagnose and resolve issues within AI clusters. Our innovations include a knowledge base tailored for cluster diagnostics, enhanced LLM algorithms, practical deployment strategies for agents, and a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating LLM capabilities in this domain. Through extensive experimentation across multiple dimensions, we have demonstrated the superiority of our system in addressing the challenges faced in cluster diagnostics, particularly in detecting and rectifying performance issues more efficiently and accurately than traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Solving 7x7 Killall-Go with Seki Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Game solving is the process of finding the theoretical outcome for a game, assuming that all player choices are optimal. This paper focuses on a technique that can reduce the heuristic search space significantly for 7x7 Killall-Go. In Go and Killall-Go, live patterns are stones that are protected from opponent capture. Mutual life, also referred to as seki, is when both players' stones achieve life by sharing liberties with their opponent. Whichever player attempts to capture the opponent first will leave their own stones vulnerable. Therefore, it is critical to recognize seki patterns to avoid putting oneself in jeopardy. Recognizing seki can reduce the search depth significantly. In this paper, we enumerate all seki patterns up to a predetermined area size, then store these patterns into a seki table. This allows us to recognize seki during search, which significantly improves solving efficiency for the game of Killall-Go. Experiments show that a day-long, unsolvable position can be solved in 482 seconds with the addition of a seki table. For general positions, a 10% to 20% improvement in wall clock time and node count is observed.</description>

      <title>LLMs as Method Actors: A Model for Prompt Engineering and Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce "Method Actors" as a mental model for guiding LLM prompt engineering and prompt architecture. Under this mental model, LLMs should be thought of as actors; prompts as scripts and cues; and LLM responses as performances. We apply this mental model to the task of improving LLM performance at playing Connections, a New York Times word puzzle game that prior research identified as a challenging benchmark for evaluating LLM reasoning. Our experiments with GPT-4o show that a "Method Actors" approach can significantly improve LLM performance over both a vanilla and "Chain of Thoughts" approach. A vanilla approach solves 27% of Connections puzzles in our dataset and a "Chain of Thoughts" approach solves 41% of puzzles, whereas our strongest "Method Actor" approach solves 86% of puzzles. We also test OpenAI's newest model designed specifically for complex reasoning tasks, o1-preview. When asked to solve a puzzle all at once, o1-preview solves 79% of Connections puzzles in our dataset, and when allowed to build puzzle solutions one guess at a time over multiple API calls, o1-preview solves 100% of the puzzles. Incorporating a "Method Actor" prompt architecture increases the percentage of puzzles that o1-preview solves perfectly from 76% to 87%.</description>

      <title>Understanding Representation of Deep Equilibrium Models from Neural Collapse Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Model (DEQ), which serves as a typical implicit neural network, emphasizes their memory efficiency and competitive performance compared to explicit neural networks. However, there has been relatively limited theoretical analysis on the representation of DEQ. In this paper, we utilize the Neural Collapse ($\mathcal{NC}$) as a tool to systematically analyze the representation of DEQ under both balanced and imbalanced conditions. $\mathcal{NC}$ is an interesting phenomenon in the neural network training process that characterizes the geometry of class features and classifier weights. While extensively studied in traditional explicit neural networks, the $\mathcal{NC}$ phenomenon has not received substantial attention in the context of implicit neural networks. We theoretically show that $\mathcal{NC}$ exists in DEQ under balanced conditions. Moreover, in imbalanced settings, despite the presence of minority collapse, DEQ demonstrated advantages over explicit neural networks. These advantages include the convergence of extracted features to the vertices of a simplex equiangular tight frame and self-duality properties under mild conditions, highlighting DEQ's superiority in handling imbalanced datasets. Finally, we validate our theoretical analyses through experiments in both balanced and imbalanced scenarios.</description>

      <title>Scattered Forest Search: Smarter Code Space Exploration with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to scaling LLM inference for code generation. We frame code generation as a black box optimization problem within the code space, and employ optimization-inspired techniques to enhance exploration. Specifically, we introduce Scattered Forest Search to enhance solution diversity while searching for solutions. Our theoretical analysis illustrates how these methods avoid local optima during optimization. Extensive experiments on HumanEval, MBPP, APPS, CodeContests, and Leetcode reveal significant performance improvements. For instance, our method achieves a pass@1 rate of 67.1% on HumanEval+ and 87.2% on HumanEval with GPT-3.5, marking improvements of 8.6% and 4.3% over the state-of-the-art, while also halving the iterations needed to find the correct solution. Furthermore, our method scales more efficiently than existing search techniques, including tree search, line search, and repeated sampling.</description>

Abstract: This study utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze and organize knowledge in the field of algorithmic trading. By filtering a dataset of 136 million research papers, we identified 14,342 relevant articles published between 1956 and Q1 2020. We compare traditional practices-such as keyword-based algorithms and embedding techniques-with state-of-the-art topic modeling methods that employ dimensionality reduction and clustering. This comparison allows us to assess the popularity and evolution of different approaches and themes within algorithmic trading. We demonstrate the usefulness of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the automatic extraction of knowledge, highlighting the new possibilities created by the latest iterations of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. The rationale for focusing on this topic stems from our analysis, which reveals that research articles on algorithmic trading are increasing at a faster rate than the overall number of publications. While stocks and main indices comprise more than half of all assets considered, certain asset classes, such as cryptocurrencies, exhibit a much stronger growth trend. Machine learning models have become the most popular methods in recent years. The study demonstrates the efficacy of LLMs in refining datasets and addressing intricate questions about the analyzed articles, such as comparing the efficiency of different models. Our research shows that by decomposing tasks into smaller components and incorporating reasoning steps, we can effectively tackle complex questions supported by case analyses. This approach contributes to a deeper understanding of algorithmic trading methodologies and underscores the potential of advanced NLP techniques in literature reviews.</description>

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has led many researchers to consider their usage for scientific work. Some have found benefits using LLMs to augment or automate aspects of their research pipeline, while others have urged caution due to risks and ethical concerns. Yet little work has sought to quantify and characterize how researchers use LLMs and why. We present the first large-scale survey of 816 verified research article authors to understand how the research community leverages and perceives LLMs as research tools. We examine participants' self-reported LLM usage, finding that 81% of researchers have already incorporated LLMs into different aspects of their research workflow. We also find that traditionally disadvantaged groups in academia (non-White, junior, and non-native English speaking researchers) report higher LLM usage and perceived benefits, suggesting potential for improved research equity. However, women, non-binary, and senior researchers have greater ethical concerns, potentially hindering adoption.</description>

Abstract: SAR images possess unique attributes that present challenges for both human observers and vision AI models to interpret, owing to their electromagnetic characteristics. The interpretation of SAR images encounters various hurdles, with one of the primary obstacles being the data itself, which includes issues related to both the quantity and quality of the data. The challenges can be addressed using generative AI technologies. Generative AI, often known as GenAI, is a very advanced and powerful technology in the field of artificial intelligence that has gained significant attention. The advancement has created possibilities for the creation of texts, photorealistic pictures, videos, and material in various modalities. This paper aims to comprehensively investigate the intersection of GenAI and SAR. First, we illustrate the common data generation-based applications in SAR field and compare them with computer vision tasks, analyzing the similarity, difference, and general challenges of them. Then, an overview of the latest GenAI models is systematically reviewed, including various basic models and their variations targeting the general challenges. Additionally, the corresponding applications in SAR domain are also included. Specifically, we propose to summarize the physical model based simulation approaches for SAR, and analyze the hybrid modeling methods that combine the GenAI and interpretable models. The evaluation methods that have been or could be applied to SAR, are also explored. Finally, the potential challenges and future prospects are discussed. To our best knowledge, this survey is the first exhaustive examination of the interdiscipline of SAR and GenAI, encompassing a wide range of topics, including deep neural networks, physical models, computer vision, and SAR images.

      <title>Leveraging Transfer Learning and Multiple Instance Learning for HER2 Automatic Scoring of H\&amp;E Whole Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is an important biomarker in breast cancer patients who can benefit from cost-effective automatic Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&amp;E) HER2 scoring. However, developing such scoring models requires large pixel-level annotated datasets. Transfer learning allows prior knowledge from different datasets to be reused while multiple-instance learning (MIL) allows the lack of detailed annotations to be mitigated. The aim of this work is to examine the potential of transfer learning on the performance of deep learning models pre-trained on (i) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) images, (ii) H\&amp;E images and (iii) non-medical images. A MIL framework with an attention mechanism is developed using pre-trained models as patch-embedding models. It was found that embedding models pre-trained on H\&amp;E images consistently outperformed the others, resulting in an average AUC-ROC value of $0.622$ across the 4 HER2 scores ($0.59-0.80$ per HER2 score). Furthermore, it was found that using multiple-instance learning with an attention layer not only allows for good classification results to be achieved, but it can also help with producing visual indication of HER2-positive areas in the H\&amp;E slide image by utilising the patch-wise attention weights.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound-Based AI for COVID-19 Detection: A Comprehensive Review of Public and Private Lung Ultrasound Datasets and Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people globally, with respiratory organs being strongly affected in individuals with comorbidities. Medical imaging-based diagnosis and prognosis have become increasingly popular in clinical settings for detecting COVID-19 lung infections. Among various medical imaging modalities, ultrasound stands out as a low-cost, mobile, and radiation-safe imaging technology. In this comprehensive review, we focus on AI-driven studies utilizing lung ultrasound (LUS) for COVID-19 detection and analysis. We provide a detailed overview of both publicly available and private LUS datasets and categorize the AI studies according to the dataset they used. Additionally, we systematically analyzed and tabulated the studies across various dimensions, including data preprocessing methods, AI models, cross-validation techniques, and evaluation metrics. In total, we reviewed 60 articles, 41 of which utilized public datasets, while the remaining employed private data. Our findings suggest that ultrasound-based AI studies for COVID-19 detection have great potential for clinical use, especially for children and pregnant women. Our review also provides a useful summary for future researchers and clinicians who may be interested in the field.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Privacy Risks in LLM Embeddings from Embedding Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embeddings have become a cornerstone in the functionality of large language models (LLMs) due to their ability to transform text data into rich, dense numerical representations that capture semantic and syntactic properties. These embedding vector databases serve as the long-term memory of LLMs, enabling efficient handling of a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, the surge in popularity of embedding vector databases in LLMs has been accompanied by significant concerns about privacy leakage. Embedding vector databases are particularly vulnerable to embedding inversion attacks, where adversaries can exploit the embeddings to reverse-engineer and extract sensitive information from the original text data. Existing defense mechanisms have shown limitations, often struggling to balance security with the performance of downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce Eguard, a novel defense mechanism designed to mitigate embedding inversion attacks. Eguard employs a transformer-based projection network and text mutual information optimization to safeguard embeddings while preserving the utility of LLMs. Our approach significantly reduces privacy risks, protecting over 95% of tokens from inversion while maintaining high performance across downstream tasks consistent with original embeddings.</description>

      <title>Towards Interpreting Language Models: A Case Study in Multi-Hop Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Answering multi-hop reasoning questions requires retrieving and synthesizing information from diverse sources. Language models (LMs) struggle to perform such reasoning consistently. We propose an approach to pinpoint and rectify multi-hop reasoning failures through targeted memory injections on LM attention heads. First, we analyze the per-layer activations of GPT-2 models in response to single- and multi-hop prompts. We then propose a mechanism that allows users to inject relevant prompt-specific information, which we refer to as "memories," at critical LM locations during inference. By thus enabling the LM to incorporate additional relevant information during inference, we enhance the quality of multi-hop prompt completions. We empirically show that a simple, efficient, and targeted memory injection into a key attention layer often increases the probability of the desired next token in multi-hop tasks, by up to 424%. We observe that small subsets of attention heads can significantly impact the model prediction during multi-hop reasoning. To more faithfully interpret these heads, we develop Attention Lens: an open source tool that translates the outputs of attention heads into vocabulary tokens via learned transformations called lenses. We demonstrate the use of lenses to reveal how a model arrives at its answer and use them to localize sources of model failures such as in the case of biased and malicious language generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sarcasm detection is a significant challenge in sentiment analysis, particularly due to its nature of conveying opinions where the intended meaning deviates from the literal expression. This challenge is heightened in social media contexts where code-mixing, especially in Dravidian languages, is prevalent. Code-mixing involves the blending of multiple languages within a single utterance, often with non-native scripts, complicating the task for systems trained on monolingual data. This shared task introduces a novel gold standard corpus designed for sarcasm and sentiment detection within code-mixed texts, specifically in Tamil-English and Malayalam-English languages. The primary objective of this task is to identify sarcasm and sentiment polarity within a code-mixed dataset of Tamil-English and Malayalam-English comments and posts collected from social media platforms. Each comment or post is annotated at the message level for sentiment polarity, with particular attention to the challenges posed by class imbalance, reflecting real-world scenarios.In this work, we experiment with state-of-the-art large language models like GPT-3.5 Turbo via prompting to classify comments into sarcastic or non-sarcastic categories. We obtained a macro-F1 score of 0.61 for Tamil language. We obtained a macro-F1 score of 0.50 for Malayalam language.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate diverse, situated, persuasive texts from a plurality of potential perspectives, influenced heavily by their prompts and training data. As part of LLM adoption, we seek to characterize - and ideally, manage - the socio-cultural values that they express, for reasons of safety, accuracy, inclusion, and cultural fidelity. We present a validated approach to automatically (1) extracting heterogeneous latent value propositions from texts, (2) assessing resonance and conflict of values with texts, and (3) combining these operations to characterize the pluralistic value alignment of human-sourced and LLM-sourced textual data.</description>

      <title>Improving Radiology Report Conciseness and Structure via Local Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we aim to enhance radiology reporting by improving both the conciseness and structured organization of findings (also referred to as templating), specifically by organizing information according to anatomical regions. This structured approach allows physicians to locate relevant information quickly, increasing the report's utility. We utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Mixtral, Mistral, and Llama to generate concise, well-structured reports. Among these, we primarily focus on the Mixtral model due to its superior adherence to specific formatting requirements compared to other models. To maintain data security and privacy, we run these LLMs locally behind our institution's firewall. We leverage the LangChain framework and apply five distinct prompting strategies to enforce a consistent structure in radiology reports, aiming to eliminate extraneous language and achieve a high level of conciseness. We also introduce a novel metric, the Conciseness Percentage (CP) score, to evaluate report brevity. Our dataset comprises 814 radiology reports authored by seven board-certified body radiologists at our cancer center. In evaluating the different prompting methods, we discovered that the most effective approach for generating concise, well-structured reports involves first instructing the LLM to condense the report, followed by a prompt to structure the content according to specific guidelines. We assessed all prompting strategies based on their ability to handle formatting issues, reduce report length, and adhere to formatting instructions. Our findings demonstrate that open-source, locally deployed LLMs can significantly improve radiology report conciseness and structure while conforming to specified formatting standards.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Multi-language Video Subtitle Dataset is a comprehensive collection designed to support research in text recognition across multiple languages. This dataset includes 4,224 subtitle images extracted from 24 videos sourced from online platforms. It features a wide variety of characters, including Thai consonants, vowels, tone marks, punctuation marks, numerals, Roman characters, and Arabic numerals. With 157 unique characters, the dataset provides a resource for addressing challenges in text recognition within complex backgrounds. It addresses the growing need for high-quality, multilingual text recognition data, particularly as videos with embedded subtitles become increasingly dominant on platforms like YouTube and Facebook. The variability in text length, font, and placement within these images adds complexity, offering a valuable resource for developing and evaluating deep learning models. The dataset facilitates accurate text transcription from video content while providing a foundation for improving computational efficiency in text recognition systems. As a result, it holds significant potential to drive advancements in research and innovation across various computer science disciplines, including artificial intelligence, deep learning, computer vision, and pattern recognition.</description>

      <title>PhoneLM:an Efficient and Capable Small Language Model Family through Principled Pre-training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interest in developing small language models (SLM) for on-device deployment is fast growing. However, the existing SLM design hardly considers the device hardware characteristics. Instead, this work presents a simple yet effective principle for SLM design: architecture searching for (near-)optimal runtime efficiency before pre-training. Guided by this principle, we develop PhoneLM SLM family (currently with 0.5B and 1.5B versions), that acheive the state-of-the-art capability-efficiency tradeoff among those with similar parameter size. We fully open-source the code, weights, and training datasets of PhoneLM for reproducibility and transparency, including both base and instructed versions. We also release a finetuned version of PhoneLM capable of accurate Android Intent invocation, and an end-to-end Android demo. All materials are available at https://github.com/UbiquitousLearning/PhoneLM.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMs to Enable Natural Language Search on Go-to-market Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enterprise searches require users to have complex knowledge of queries, configurations, and metadata, rendering it difficult for them to access information as needed. Most go-to-market (GTM) platforms utilize advanced search, an interface that enables users to filter queries by various fields using categories or keywords, which, historically, however, has proven to be exceedingly cumbersome, as users are faced with seemingly hundreds of options, fields, and buttons. Consequently, querying with natural language has long been ideal, a notion further empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs).
  In this paper, we implement and evaluate a solution for the Zoominfo product for sellers, which prompts the LLM with natural language, producing search fields through entity extraction that are then converted into a search query. The intermediary search fields offer numerous advantages for each query, including the elimination of syntax errors, simpler ground truths, and an intuitive format for the LLM to interpret.
  We paired this pipeline with many advanced prompt engineering strategies, featuring an intricate system message, few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and execution refinement. Furthermore, we manually created the ground truth for 500+ natural language queries, enabling the supervised fine-tuning of Llama-3-8B-Instruct and the introduction of sophisticated numerical metrics.
  Comprehensive experiments with closed, open source, and fine-tuned LLM models were conducted through exact, Jaccard, cosine, and semantic similarity on individual search entities to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Overall, the most accurate closed model had an average accuracy of 97% per query, with only one field performing under 90%, with comparable results observed from the fine-tuned models.</description>

      <title>Selecting Between BERT and GPT for Text Classification in Political Science Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Political scientists often grapple with data scarcity in text classification. Recently, fine-tuned BERT models and their variants have gained traction as effective solutions to address this issue. In this study, we investigate the potential of GPT-based models combined with prompt engineering as a viable alternative. We conduct a series of experiments across various classification tasks, differing in the number of classes and complexity, to evaluate the effectiveness of BERT-based versus GPT-based models in low-data scenarios. Our findings indicate that while zero-shot and few-shot learning with GPT models provide reasonable performance and are well-suited for early-stage research exploration, they generally fall short - or, at best, match - the performance of BERT fine-tuning, particularly as the training set reaches a substantial size (e.g., 1,000 samples). We conclude by comparing these approaches in terms of performance, ease of use, and cost, providing practical guidance for researchers facing data limitations. Our results are particularly relevant for those engaged in quantitative text analysis in low-resource settings or with limited labeled data.</description>

Abstract: With the growing applications of Deep Learning (DL), especially recent spectacular achievements of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and LLaMA, the commercial significance of these remarkable models has soared. However, acquiring well-trained models is costly and resource-intensive. It requires a considerable high-quality dataset, substantial investment in dedicated architecture design, expensive computational resources, and efforts to develop technical expertise. Consequently, safeguarding the Intellectual Property (IP) of well-trained models is attracting increasing attention. In contrast to existing surveys overwhelmingly focusing on model IPP mainly, this survey not only encompasses the protection on model level intelligence but also valuable dataset intelligence. Firstly, according to the requirements for effective IPP design, this work systematically summarizes the general and scheme-specific performance evaluation metrics. Secondly, from proactive IP infringement prevention and reactive IP ownership verification perspectives, it comprehensively investigates and analyzes the existing IPP methods for both dataset and model intelligence. Additionally, from the standpoint of training settings, it delves into the unique challenges that distributed settings pose to IPP compared to centralized settings. Furthermore, this work examines various attacks faced by deep IPP techniques. Finally, we outline prospects for promising future directions that may act as a guide for innovative research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models show great promise for generative tasks in many domains. Here we discuss the use of foundation models to generate structured documents related to critical assets. A Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) captures the composition of an asset or piece of equipment, the ways it may fail and the consequences thereof. Our system uses large language models to enable fast and expert supervised generation of new FMEA documents. Empirical analysis shows that foundation models can correctly generate over half of an FMEA's key content. Results from polling audiences of reliability professionals show a positive outlook on using generative AI to create these documents for critical assets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classification of genetic variants, particularly Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS), poses a significant challenge in clinical genetics and precision medicine. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools in this realm. These models can uncover intricate patterns and predictive insights that traditional methods might miss, thus enhancing the predictive accuracy of genetic variant pathogenicity.
  This study investigates the integration of state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPN-MSA, ESM1b, and AlphaMissense, which leverage DNA and protein sequence data alongside structural insights to form a comprehensive analytical framework for variant classification. Our approach evaluates these integrated models using the well-annotated ProteinGym and ClinVar datasets, setting new benchmarks in classification performance. The models were rigorously tested on a set of challenging variants, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art tools, especially in handling ambiguous and clinically uncertain variants.
  The results of this research underline the efficacy of combining multiple modeling approaches to significantly refine the accuracy and reliability of genetic variant classification systems. These findings support the deployment of these advanced computational models in clinical environments, where they can significantly enhance the diagnostic processes for genetic disorders, ultimately pushing the boundaries of personalized medicine by offering more detailed and actionable genetic insights.</description>

      <title>Seeing is Deceiving: Exploitation of Visual Pathways in Multi-Modal Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Modal Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence by combining visual and text data, making applications like image captioning, visual question answering, and multi-modal content creation possible. This ability to understand and work with complex information has made MLLMs useful in areas such as healthcare, autonomous systems, and digital content. However, integrating multiple types of data also creates security risks. Attackers can manipulate either the visual or text inputs, or both, to make the model produce unintended or even harmful responses. This paper reviews how visual inputs in MLLMs can be exploited by various attack strategies. We break down these attacks into categories: simple visual tweaks and cross-modal manipulations, as well as advanced strategies like VLATTACK, HADES, and Collaborative Multimodal Adversarial Attack (Co-Attack). These attacks can mislead even the most robust models while looking nearly identical to the original visuals, making them hard to detect. We also discuss the broader security risks, including threats to privacy and safety in important applications. To counter these risks, we review current defense methods like the SmoothVLM framework, pixel-wise randomization, and MirrorCheck, looking at their strengths and limitations. We also discuss new methods to make MLLMs more secure, including adaptive defenses, better evaluation tools, and security approaches that protect both visual and text data. By bringing together recent developments and identifying key areas for improvement, this review aims to support the creation of more secure and reliable multi-modal AI systems for real-world use.</description>

      <title>FineTuneBench: How well do commercial fine-tuning APIs infuse knowledge into LLMs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is great interest in fine-tuning frontier large language models (LLMs) to inject new information and update existing knowledge. While commercial LLM fine-tuning APIs from providers such as OpenAI and Google promise flexible adaptation for various applications, the efficacy of fine-tuning remains unclear. In this study, we introduce FineTuneBench, an evaluation framework and dataset for understanding how well commercial fine-tuning APIs can successfully learn new and updated knowledge. We analyze five frontier LLMs with commercially available fine-tuning APIs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, on their effectiveness in two settings: (1) ingesting novel information, such as recent news events and new people profiles, and (2) updating existing knowledge, such as updated medical guidelines and code frameworks. Our results reveal substantial shortcomings in all the models' abilities to effectively learn new information through fine-tuning, with an average generalization accuracy of 37% across all models. When updating existing knowledge, such as incorporating medical guideline updates, commercial fine-tuning APIs show even more limited capability (average generalization accuracy of 19%). Overall, fine-tuning GPT-4o mini is the most effective for infusing new knowledge and updating knowledge, followed by GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o. The fine-tuning APIs for Gemini 1.5 Flesh and Gemini 1.5 Pro are unable to learn new knowledge or update existing knowledge. These findings underscore a major shortcoming in using current commercial fine-tuning services to achieve reliable knowledge infusion in common scenarios. We open source the FineTuneBench dataset at https://github.com/kevinwu23/StanfordFineTuneBench.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the transition dynamics $T^*$ from near-optimal expert trajectories in the context of offline model-based reinforcement learning. We develop a novel constraint-based method, Inverse Transition Learning, that treats the limited coverage of the expert trajectories as a \emph{feature}: we use the fact that the expert is near-optimal to inform our estimate of $T^*$. We integrate our constraints into a Bayesian approach. Across both synthetic environments and real healthcare scenarios like Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patient management in hypotension, we demonstrate not only significant improvements in decision-making, but that our posterior can inform when transfer will be successful.</description>

      <title>Explaining Mixtures of Sources in News Articles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human writers plan, then write. For large language models (LLMs) to play a role in longer-form article generation, we must understand the planning steps humans make before writing. We explore one kind of planning, source-selection in news, as a case-study for evaluating plans in long-form generation. We ask: why do specific stories call for specific kinds of sources? We imagine a generative process for story writing where a source-selection schema is first selected by a journalist, and then sources are chosen based on categories in that schema. Learning the article's plan means predicting the schema initially chosen by the journalist. Working with professional journalists, we adapt five existing schemata and introduce three new ones to describe journalistic plans for the inclusion of sources in documents. Then, inspired by Bayesian latent-variable modeling, we develop metrics to select the most likely plan, or schema, underlying a story, which we use to compare schemata. We find that two schemata: stance and social affiliation best explain source plans in most documents. However, other schemata like textual entailment explain source plans in factually rich topics like "Science". Finally, we find we can predict the most suitable schema given just the article's headline with reasonable accuracy. We see this as an important case-study for human planning, and provides a framework and approach for evaluating other kinds of plans. We release a corpora, NewsSources, with annotations for 4M articles.</description>

      <title>Q-SFT: Q-Learning for Language Models via Supervised Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Value-based reinforcement learning (RL) can in principle learn effective policies for a wide range of multi-turn problems, from games to dialogue to robotic control, including via offline RL from static previously collected datasets. However, despite the widespread use of policy gradient methods to train large language models for single turn tasks (e.g., question answering), value-based methods for multi-turn RL in an off-policy or offline setting have proven particularly challenging to scale to the setting of large language models. This setting requires effectively leveraging pretraining, scaling to large architectures with billions of parameters, and training on large datasets, all of which represent major challenges for current value-based RL methods. In this work, we propose a novel offline RL algorithm that addresses these drawbacks, casting Q-learning as a modified supervised fine-tuning (SFT) problem where the probabilities of tokens directly translate to Q-values. In this way we obtain an algorithm that smoothly transitions from maximizing the likelihood of the data during pretraining to learning a near-optimal Q-function during finetuning. Our algorithm has strong theoretical foundations, enjoying performance bounds similar to state-of-the-art Q-learning methods, while in practice utilizing an objective that closely resembles SFT. Because of this, our approach can enjoy the full benefits of the pretraining of language models, without the need to reinitialize any weights before RL finetuning, and without the need to initialize new heads for predicting values or advantages. Empirically, we evaluate our method on both pretrained LLMs and VLMs, on a variety of tasks including both natural language dialogue and robotic manipulation and navigation from images.</description>

      <title>Interactive Dialogue Agents via Reinforcement Learning on Hindsight Regenerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress on large language models (LLMs) has enabled dialogue agents to generate highly naturalistic and plausible text. However, current LLM language generation focuses on responding accurately to questions and requests with a single effective response. In reality, many real dialogues are interactive, meaning an agent's utterances will influence their conversational partner, elicit information, or change their opinion. Accounting for how an agent can effectively steer a conversation is a crucial ability in many dialogue tasks, from healthcare to preference elicitation. Existing methods for fine-tuning dialogue agents to accomplish such tasks would rely on curating some amount of expert data. However, doing so often requires understanding the underlying cognitive processes of the conversational partner, which is a skill neither humans nor LLMs trained on human data can reliably do. Our key insight is that while LLMs may not be adept at identifying effective strategies for steering conversations a priori, or in the middle of an ongoing conversation, they can do so post-hoc, or in hindsight, after seeing how their conversational partner responds. We use this fact to rewrite and augment existing suboptimal data, and train via offline reinforcement learning (RL) an agent that outperforms both prompting and learning from unaltered human demonstrations. We apply our approach to two domains that require understanding human mental state, intelligent interaction, and persuasion: mental health support, and soliciting charitable donations. Our results in a user study with real humans show that our approach greatly outperforms existing state-of-the-art dialogue agents.</description>

      <title>Maximizing User Connectivity in AI-Enabled Multi-UAV Networks: A Distributed Strategy Generalized to Arbitrary User Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been extensively applied to Multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) network (MUN) to effectively enable real-time adaptation to complex, time-varying environments. Nevertheless, most of the existing works assume a stationary user distribution (UD) or a dynamic one with predicted patterns. Such considerations may make the UD-specific strategies insufficient when a MUN is deployed in unknown environments. To this end, this paper investigates distributed user connectivity maximization problem in a MUN with generalization to arbitrary UDs. Specifically, the problem is first formulated into a time-coupled combinatorial nonlinear non-convex optimization with arbitrary underlying UDs. To make the optimization tractable, a multi-agent CNN-enhanced deep Q learning (MA-CDQL) algorithm is proposed. The algorithm integrates a ResNet-based CNN to the policy network to analyze the input UD in real time and obtain optimal decisions based on the extracted high-level UD features. To improve the learning efficiency and avoid local optimums, a heatmap algorithm is developed to transform the raw UD to a continuous density map. The map will be part of the true input to the policy network. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of UD heatmaps and the proposed algorithm in maximizing user connectivity as compared to K-means methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various tasks, yet their ability to handle long-context reading remains challenging. This study explores the effectiveness of leveraging high-quality academic peer review data for fine-tuning LLMs to enhance their long-context capabilities. We compare the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) method with the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) method, demonstrating DPO's superiority and data efficiency. Our experiments show that the fine-tuned model achieves a 4.04-point improvement over phi-3 and a 2.6\% increase on the Qasper benchmark using only 2000 samples. Despite facing limitations in data scale and processing costs, this study underscores the potential of DPO and high-quality data in advancing LLM performance.
  Additionally, the zero-shot benchmark results indicate that aggregated high-quality human reviews are overwhelmingly preferred over LLM-generated responses, even for the most capable models like GPT-4o. This suggests that high-quality human reviews are extremely rich in information, reasoning, and long-context retrieval, capabilities that even the most advanced models have not fully captured. These findings highlight the high utility of leveraging human reviews to further advance the field.</description>

      <title>QuanCrypt-FL: Quantized Homomorphic Encryption with Pruning for Secure Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning has emerged as a leading approach for decentralized machine learning, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exchanging private data. While FL enhances data privacy, it remains vulnerable to inference attacks, such as gradient inversion and membership inference, during both training and inference phases. Homomorphic Encryption provides a promising solution by encrypting model updates to protect against such attacks, but it introduces substantial communication overhead, slowing down training and increasing computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose QuanCrypt-FL, a novel algorithm that combines low-bit quantization and pruning techniques to enhance protection against attacks while significantly reducing computational costs during training. Further, we propose and implement mean-based clipping to mitigate quantization overflow or errors. By integrating these methods, QuanCrypt-FL creates a communication-efficient FL framework that ensures privacy protection with minimal impact on model accuracy, thereby improving both computational efficiency and attack resilience. We validate our approach on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. QuanCrypt-FL consistently outperforms existing method and matches Vanilla-FL in terms of accuracy across varying client. Further, QuanCrypt-FL achieves up to 9x faster encryption, 16x faster decryption, and 1.5x faster inference compared to BatchCrypt, with training time reduced by up to 3x.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in report generation methods, a critical limitation remains: the lack of interpretability in the generated text. This paper introduces an innovative approach to enhance the explainability of text generated by report generation models. Our method employs cyclic text manipulation and visual comparison to identify and elucidate the features in the original content that influence the generated text. By manipulating the generated reports and producing corresponding images, we create a comparative framework that highlights key attributes and their impact on the text generation process. This approach not only identifies the image features aligned to the generated text but also improves transparency but also provides deeper insights into the decision-making mechanisms of the report generation models. Our findings demonstrate the potential of this method to significantly enhance the interpretability and transparency of AI-generated reports.</description>

We evaluate different hallucination detection systems using the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and cost-effectiveness metrics. Our results indicate that although advanced models can perform better they come at a much higher cost. We also demonstrate how an ideal hallucination detection system needs to maintain performance across different model sizes. Our findings highlight the importance of choosing a detection system aligned with specific application needs and resource constraints. Future research will explore hybrid systems and automated identification of underperforming components to enhance AI reliability and efficiency in detecting and mitigating hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Real-World Offline Reinforcement Learning from Vision Language Model Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning can enable policy learning from pre-collected, sub-optimal datasets without online interactions. This makes it ideal for real-world robots and safety-critical scenarios, where collecting online data or expert demonstrations is slow, costly, and risky. However, most existing offline RL works assume the dataset is already labeled with the task rewards, a process that often requires significant human effort, especially when ground-truth states are hard to ascertain (e.g., in the real-world). In this paper, we build on prior work, specifically RL-VLM-F, and propose a novel system that automatically generates reward labels for offline datasets using preference feedback from a vision-language model and a text description of the task. Our method then learns a policy using offline RL with the reward-labeled dataset. We demonstrate the system's applicability to a complex real-world robot-assisted dressing task, where we first learn a reward function using a vision-language model on a sub-optimal offline dataset, and then we use the learned reward to employ Implicit Q learning to develop an effective dressing policy. Our method also performs well in simulation tasks involving the manipulation of rigid and deformable objects, and significantly outperform baselines such as behavior cloning and inverse RL. In summary, we propose a new system that enables automatic reward labeling and policy learning from unlabeled, sub-optimal offline datasets.</description>

Abstract: We present Fox-1, a series of small language models (SLMs) consisting of Fox-1-1.6B and Fox-1-1.6B-Instruct-v0.1. These models are pre-trained on 3 trillion tokens of web-scraped document data and fine-tuned with 5 billion tokens of instruction-following and multi-turn conversation data. Aiming to improve the pre-training efficiency, Fox-1-1.6B model introduces a novel 3-stage data curriculum across all the training data with 2K-8K sequence length. In architecture design, Fox-1 features a deeper layer structure, an expanded vocabulary, and utilizes Grouped Query Attention (GQA), offering a performant and efficient architecture compared to other SLMs. Fox-1 achieves better or on-par performance in various benchmarks compared to StableLM-2-1.6B, Gemma-2B, Qwen1.5-1.8B, and OpenELM1.1B, with competitive inference speed and throughput. The model weights have been released under the Apache 2.0 license, where we aim to promote the democratization of LLMs and make them fully accessible to the whole open-source community.</description>

      <title>MicroScopiQ: Accelerating Foundational Models through Outlier-Aware Microscaling Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization of foundational models (FMs) is significantly more challenging than traditional DNNs due to the emergence of large magnitude features called outliers. Existing outlier-aware algorithm/architecture co-design techniques either use mixed-precision, retaining outliers at high precision but compromise hardware efficiency, or quantize inliers and outliers at the same precision, improving hardware efficiency at the cost of accuracy. To address this mutual exclusivity, in this paper, we propose MicroScopiQ, a novel co-design technique that leverages pruning to complement outlier-aware quantization. MicroScopiQ retains outliers at higher precision while pruning a certain fraction of least important weights to distribute the additional outlier bits; ensuring high accuracy, aligned memory and hardware efficiency. We design a high-throughput, low overhead accelerator architecture composed of simple multi-precision INT processing elements and a novel network-on-chip called ReCoN that efficiently abstracts the complexity of supporting high-precision outliers. Additionally, unlike existing alternatives, MicroScopiQ does not assume any locality of outlier weights, enabling applicability to a broad range of FMs. Extensive experiments across various quantization settings show that MicroScopiQ achieves SoTA quantization performance while simultaneously improving inference performance by 3x and reducing energy by 2x over existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>SpecHub: Provable Acceleration to Multi-Draft Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential in advancing natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but their sequential token generation limits inference speed. Multi-Draft Speculative Decoding (MDSD) offers a promising solution by using a smaller draft model to generate multiple token sequences, which the target LLM verifies in parallel. However, current heuristic approaches, such as Recursive Rejection Sampling (RRS), suffer from low acceptance rates in subsequent drafts, limiting the advantages of using multiple drafts. Meanwhile, Optimal Transport with Membership Cost (OTM) can theoretically improve acceptance rates, but its computational cost is too high for real-time use. We present SpecHub, a novel, efficient sampling-verification method for MDSD that improves acceptance rates with only linear computational overhead. By simplifying the OTM problem into a compact Linear Programming model, SpecHub significantly reduces computational complexity. It further accelerates sampling by leveraging a sparse joint distribution, focusing computation on high-probability token sequences. In extensive experiments, Spechub consistently generates 0.05-0.27 and 0.02-0.16 more tokens per step than RRS and RRS without replacement.

      <title>SimpleBEV: Improved LiDAR-Camera Fusion Architecture for 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More and more research works fuse the LiDAR and camera information to improve the 3D object detection of the autonomous driving system. Recently, a simple yet effective fusion framework has achieved an excellent detection performance, fusing the LiDAR and camera features in a unified bird's-eye-view (BEV) space. In this paper, we propose a LiDAR-camera fusion framework, named SimpleBEV, for accurate 3D object detection, which follows the BEV-based fusion framework and improves the camera and LiDAR encoders, respectively. Specifically, we perform the camera-based depth estimation using a cascade network and rectify the depth results with the depth information derived from the LiDAR points. Meanwhile, an auxiliary branch that implements the 3D object detection using only the camera-BEV features is introduced to exploit the camera information during the training phase. Besides, we improve the LiDAR feature extractor by fusing the multi-scaled sparse convolutional features. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our method achieves 77.6\% NDS accuracy on the nuScenes dataset, showcasing superior performance in the 3D object detection track.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks have recently been introduced as a flexible alternative to multi-layer Perceptron architectures. In this paper, we examine the training dynamics of different KAN architectures and compare them with corresponding MLP formulations. We train with a variety of different initialization schemes, optimizers, and learning rates, as well as utilize back propagation free approaches like the HSIC Bottleneck. We find that (when judged by test accuracy) KANs are an effective alternative to MLP architectures on high-dimensional datasets and have somewhat better parameter efficiency, but suffer from more unstable training dynamics. Finally, we provide recommendations for improving training stability of larger KAN models.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Network Perturbation for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS), weak-to-strong consistency regularization techniques are widely utilized in recent works, typically combined with input-level and feature-level perturbations. However, the integration between weak-to-strong consistency regularization and network perturbation has been relatively rare. We note several problems with existing network perturbations in SSS that may contribute to this phenomenon. By revisiting network perturbations, we introduce a new approach for network perturbation to expand the existing weak-to-strong consistency regularization for unlabeled data. Additionally, we present a volatile learning process for labeled data, which is uncommon in existing research. Building upon previous work that includes input-level and feature-level perturbations, we present MLPMatch (Multi-Level-Perturbation Match), an easy-to-implement and efficient framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation. MLPMatch has been validated on the Pascal VOC and Cityscapes datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available from https://github.com/LlistenL/MLPMatch.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Alignment Landscape: LLMs and Geometric Deep Models in Protein Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent representation alignment has become a foundational technique for constructing multimodal large language models (MLLM) by mapping embeddings from different modalities into a shared space, often aligned with the embedding space of large language models (LLMs) to enable effective cross-modal understanding. While preliminary protein-focused MLLMs have emerged, they have predominantly relied on heuristic approaches, lacking a fundamental understanding of optimal alignment practices across representations. In this study, we explore the alignment of multimodal representations between LLMs and Geometric Deep Models (GDMs) in the protein domain. We comprehensively evaluate three state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma2-2B, LLaMa3.1-8B, and LLaMa3.1-70B) with four protein-specialized GDMs (GearNet, GVP, ScanNet, GAT). Our work examines alignment factors from both model and protein perspectives, identifying challenges in current alignment methodologies and proposing strategies to improve the alignment process. Our key findings reveal that GDMs incorporating both graph and 3D structural information align better with LLMs, larger LLMs demonstrate improved alignment capabilities, and protein rarity significantly impacts alignment performance. We also find that increasing GDM embedding dimensions, using two-layer projection heads, and fine-tuning LLMs on protein-specific data substantially enhance alignment quality. These strategies offer potential enhancements to the performance of protein-related multimodal models. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Tizzzzy/LLM-GDM-alignment.</description>

      <title>Inversion-based Latent Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent Bayesian optimization (LBO) approaches have successfully adopted Bayesian optimization over a continuous latent space by employing an encoder-decoder architecture to address the challenge of optimization in a high dimensional or discrete input space. LBO learns a surrogate model to approximate the black-box objective function in the latent space. However, we observed that most LBO methods suffer from the `misalignment problem`, which is induced by the reconstruction error of the encoder-decoder architecture. It hinders learning an accurate surrogate model and generating high-quality solutions. In addition, several trust region-based LBO methods select the anchor, the center of the trust region, based solely on the objective function value without considering the trust region`s potential to enhance the optimization process. To address these issues, we propose Inversion-based Latent Bayesian Optimization (InvBO), a plug-and-play module for LBO. InvBO consists of two components: an inversion method and a potential-aware trust region anchor selection. The inversion method searches the latent code that completely reconstructs the given target data. The potential-aware trust region anchor selection considers the potential capability of the trust region for better local optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of InvBO on nine real-world benchmarks, such as molecule design and arithmetic expression fitting tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/InvBO.</description>

      <title>Improving Multi-Domain Task-Oriented Dialogue System with Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) system is designed to accomplish user-defined tasks through dialogues. The TOD system has progressed towards end-to-end modeling by leveraging pre-trained large language models. Fine-tuning the pre-trained language models using only supervised learning leads to the exposure bias and token loss problem and it deviates the models from completing the user's task. To address these issues, we propose a TOD system that leverages a unified pre-trained language model, GPT2, as a base model. It is optimized using supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL). The issues in the TOD system are mitigated using a non-differentiable reward function. The reward is calculated using the weighted sum of the success rate and BLEU evaluation metrics. The success rate and BLEU metrics in reward calculation guide the language model for user task completion while ensuring a coherent and fluent response. Our model is acquired by fine-tuning a pre-trained model on the dialogue-session level which comprises user utterance, belief state, system act, and system response. Experimental results on MultiWOZ2.1 demonstrate that our model increases the inform rate by 1.60% and the success rate by 3.17% compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Robustness of LLMs to Adversarial Typographical Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, CoT can be biased by users' instruction. In this work, we study the reasoning robustness of LLMs to typographical errors, which can naturally occur in users' queries. We design an Adversarial Typo Attack ($\texttt{ATA}$) algorithm that iteratively samples typos for words that are important to the query and selects the edit that is most likely to succeed in attacking. It shows that LLMs are sensitive to minimal adversarial typographical changes. Notably, with 1 character edit, Mistral-7B-Instruct's accuracy drops from 43.7% to 38.6% on GSM8K, while with 8 character edits the performance further drops to 19.2%. To extend our evaluation to larger and closed-source LLMs, we develop the $\texttt{R$^2$ATA}$ benchmark, which assesses models' $\underline{R}$easoning $\underline{R}$obustness to $\underline{\texttt{ATA}}$. It includes adversarial typographical questions derived from three widely used reasoning datasets-GSM8K, BBH, and MMLU-by applying $\texttt{ATA}$ to open-source LLMs. $\texttt{R$^2$ATA}$ demonstrates remarkable transferability and causes notable performance drops across multiple super large and closed-source LLMs.</description>

      <title>Controlling Grokking with Nonlinearity and Data Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that grokking behavior in modular arithmetic with a modulus P in a neural network can be controlled by modifying the profile of the activation function as well as the depth and width of the model. Plotting the even PCA projections of the weights of the last NN layer against their odd projections further yields patterns which become significantly more uniform when the nonlinearity is increased by incrementing the number of layers. These patterns can be employed to factor P when P is nonprime. Finally, a metric for the generalization ability of the network is inferred from the entropy of the layer weights while the degree of nonlinearity is related to correlations between the local entropy of the weights of the neurons in the final layer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agricultural landscapes are quite complex, especially in the Global South where fields are smaller, and agricultural practices are more varied. In this paper we report on our progress in digitizing the agricultural landscape (natural and man-made) in our study region of India. We use high resolution imagery and a UNet style segmentation model to generate the first of its kind national-scale multi-class panoptic segmentation output. Through this work we have been able to identify individual fields across 151.7M hectares, and delineating key features such as water resources and vegetation. We share how this output was validated by our team and externally by downstream users, including some sample use cases that can lead to targeted data driven decision making. We believe this dataset will contribute towards digitizing agriculture by generating the foundational baselayer.</description>

      <title>Ev2R: Evaluating Evidence Retrieval in Automated Fact-Checking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current automated fact-checking (AFC) approaches commonly evaluate evidence either implicitly via the predicted verdicts or by comparing retrieved evidence with a predefined closed knowledge source, such as Wikipedia. However, these methods suffer from limitations, resulting from their reliance on evaluation metrics developed for different purposes and constraints imposed by closed knowledge sources. Recent advances in natural language generation (NLG) evaluation offer new possibilities for evidence assessment. In this work, we introduce Ev2R, an evaluation framework for AFC that comprises three types of approaches for evidence evaluation: reference-based, proxy-reference, and reference-less. We evaluate their effectiveness through agreement with human ratings and adversarial tests, and demonstrate that prompt-based scorers, particularly those leveraging LLMs and reference evidence, outperform traditional evaluation approaches.</description>

      <title>Advancing Meteorological Forecasting: AI-based Approach to Synoptic Weather Map Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As global warming increases the complexity of weather patterns; the precision of weather forecasting becomes increasingly important. Our study proposes a novel preprocessing method and convolutional autoencoder model developed to improve the interpretation of synoptic weather maps. These are critical for meteorologists seeking a thorough understanding of weather conditions. This model could recognize historical synoptic weather maps that nearly match current atmospheric conditions, marking a significant step forward in modern technology in meteorological forecasting. This comprises unsupervised learning models like VQ-VQE, as well as supervised learning models like VGG16, VGG19, Xception, InceptionV3, and ResNet50 trained on the ImageNet dataset, as well as research into newer models like EfficientNet and ConvNeXt. Our findings proved that, while these models perform well in various settings, their ability to identify comparable synoptic weather maps has certain limits. Our research, motivated by the primary goal of significantly increasing meteorologists' efficiency in labor-intensive tasks, discovered that cosine similarity is the most effective metric, as determined by a combination of quantitative and qualitative assessments to accurately identify relevant historical weather patterns. This study broadens our understanding by shifting the emphasis from numerical precision to practical application, ensuring that our model is effective in theory practical, and accessible in the complex and dynamic field of meteorology.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Distributional Alignment of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) are increasingly used as simulacra for people, yet their ability to match the distribution of views of a specific demographic group and be \textit{distributionally aligned} remains uncertain. This notion of distributional alignment is complex, as there is significant variation in the types of attributes that are simulated. Prior works have underexplored the role of three critical variables -- the question domain, steering method, and distribution expression method -- which motivates our contribution of a benchmark explicitly addressing these dimensions. We construct a dataset expanding beyond political values, create human baselines for this task, and evaluate the extent to which an LM can align with a particular group's opinion distribution to inform design choices of such simulation systems. Our analysis reveals open problems regarding if, and how, LMs can be used to simulate humans, and that LLMs can more accurately describe the opinion distribution than simulate such distributions.</description>

      <title>Web Archives Metadata Generation with GPT-4o: Challenges and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current metadata creation for web archives is time consuming and costly due to reliance on human effort. This paper explores the use of gpt-4o for metadata generation within the Web Archive Singapore, focusing on scalability, efficiency, and cost effectiveness. We processed 112 Web ARChive (WARC) files using data reduction techniques, achieving a notable 99.9% reduction in metadata generation costs. By prompt engineering, we generated titles and abstracts, which were evaluated both intrinsically using Levenshtein Distance and BERTScore, and extrinsically with human cataloguers using McNemar's test. Results indicate that while our method offers significant cost savings and efficiency gains, human curated metadata maintains an edge in quality. The study identifies key challenges including content inaccuracies, hallucinations, and translation issues, suggesting that Large Language Models (LLMs) should serve as complements rather than replacements for human cataloguers. Future work will focus on refining prompts, improving content filtering, and addressing privacy concerns through experimentation with smaller models. This research advances the integration of LLMs in web archiving, offering valuable insights into their current capabilities and outlining directions for future enhancements. The code is available at https://github.com/masamune-prog/warc2summary for further development and use by institutions facing similar challenges.</description>

      <title>WeatherGFM: Learning A Weather Generalist Foundation Model via In-context Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Earth's weather system encompasses intricate weather data modalities and diverse weather understanding tasks, which hold significant value to human life. Existing data-driven models focus on single weather understanding tasks (e.g., weather forecasting). Although these models have achieved promising results, they fail to tackle various complex tasks within a single and unified model. Moreover, the paradigm that relies on limited real observations for a single scenario hinders the model's performance upper bound. In response to these limitations, we draw inspiration from the in-context learning paradigm employed in state-of-the-art visual foundation models and large language models. In this paper, we introduce the first generalist weather foundation model (WeatherGFM), designed to address a wide spectrum of weather understanding tasks in a unified manner. More specifically, we initially unify the representation and definition of the diverse weather understanding tasks. Subsequently, we devised weather prompt formats to manage different weather data modalities, namely single, multiple, and temporal modalities. Finally, we adopt a visual prompting question-answering paradigm for the training of unified weather understanding tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that our WeatherGFM can effectively handle up to ten weather understanding tasks, including weather forecasting, super-resolution, weather image translation, and post-processing. Our method also showcases generalization ability on unseen tasks.</description>

      <title>Learning the rules of peptide self-assembly through data mining with large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peptides are ubiquitous and important biologically derived molecules, that have been found to self-assemble to form a wide array of structures. Extensive research has explored the impacts of both internal chemical composition and external environmental stimuli on the self-assembly behaviour of these systems. However, there is yet to be a systematic study that gathers this rich literature data and collectively examines these experimental factors to provide a global picture of the fundamental rules that govern protein self-assembly behavior. In this work, we curate a peptide assembly database through a combination of manual processing by human experts and literature mining facilitated by a large language model. As a result, we collect more than 1,000 experimental data entries with information about peptide sequence, experimental conditions and corresponding self-assembly phases. Utilizing the collected data, ML models are trained and evaluated, demonstrating excellent accuracy (&gt;80\%) and efficiency in peptide assembly phase classification. Moreover, we fine-tune our GPT model for peptide literature mining with the developed dataset, which exhibits markedly superior performance in extracting information from academic publications relative to the pre-trained model. We find that this workflow can substantially improve efficiency when exploring potential self-assembling peptide candidates, through guiding experimental work, while also deepening our understanding of the mechanisms governing peptide self-assembly. In doing so, novel structures can be accessed for a range of applications including sensing, catalysis and biomaterials.</description>

      <title>VISTA: Visual Integrated System for Tailored Automation in Math Problem Generation Using LLM</title>

Abstract: Generating accurate and consistent visual aids is a critical challenge in mathematics education, where visual representations like geometric shapes and functions play a pivotal role in enhancing student comprehension. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the creation of complex mathematical visualizations alongside coherent problem text. Our approach not only simplifies the generation of precise visual aids but also aligns these aids with the problem's core mathematical concepts, improving both problem creation and assessment. By integrating multiple agents, each responsible for distinct tasks such as numeric calculation, geometry validation, and visualization, our system delivers mathematically accurate and contextually relevant problems with visual aids. Evaluation across Geometry and Function problem types shows that our method significantly outperforms basic LLMs in terms of text coherence, consistency, relevance and similarity, while maintaining the essential geometrical and functional integrity of the original problems. Although some challenges remain in ensuring consistent visual outputs, our framework demonstrates the immense potential of LLMs in transforming the way educators generate and utilize visual aids in math education.</description>

      <title>ICE-T: A Multi-Faceted Concept for Teaching Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topics of Artificial intelligence (AI) and especially Machine Learning (ML) are increasingly making their way into educational curricula. To facilitate the access for students, a variety of platforms, visual tools, and digital games are already being used to introduce ML concepts and strengthen the understanding of how AI works. We take a look at didactic principles that are employed for teaching computer science, define criteria, and, based on those, evaluate a selection of prominent existing platforms, tools, and games. Additionally, we criticize the approach of portraying ML mostly as a black-box and the resulting missing focus on creating an understanding of data, algorithms, and models that come with it. To tackle this issue, we present a concept that covers intermodal transfer, computational and explanatory thinking, ICE-T, as an extension of known didactic principles. With our multi-faceted concept, we believe that planners of learning units, creators of learning platforms and educators can improve on teaching ML.</description>

      <title>WorkflowLLM: Enhancing Workflow Orchestration Capability of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have driven a revolutionary paradigm shift in process automation from Robotic Process Automation to Agentic Process Automation by automating the workflow orchestration procedure based on LLMs. However, existing LLMs (even the advanced OpenAI GPT-4o) are confined to achieving satisfactory capability in workflow orchestration. To address this limitation, we present WorkflowLLM, a data-centric framework elaborately designed to enhance the capability of LLMs in workflow orchestration. It first constructs a large-scale fine-tuning dataset WorkflowBench with 106,763 samples, covering 1,503 APIs from 83 applications across 28 categories. Specifically, the construction process can be divided into three phases: (1) Data Collection: we collect real-world workflow data from Apple Shortcuts and RoutineHub, transcribing them into Python-style code. We further equip them with generated hierarchical thought via ChatGPT. (2) Query Expansion: we prompt ChatGPT to generate more task queries to enrich the diversity and complexity of workflows. (3) Workflow Generation: we leverage an annotator model trained on collected data to generate workflows for synthesized queries. Finally, we merge the synthetic samples that pass quality confirmation with the collected samples to obtain the WorkflowBench. Based on WorkflowBench, we fine-tune Llama-3.1-8B to obtain WorkflowLlama. Our experiments show that WorkflowLlama demonstrates a strong capacity to orchestrate complex workflows, while also achieving notable generalization performance on previously unseen APIs. Additionally, WorkflowBench exhibits robust zero-shot generalization capabilities on an out-of-distribution task planning dataset, T-Eval. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/WorkflowLLM.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Foundation Models for Digital Dermatology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for accurate and equitable AI models in digital dermatology faces a significant challenge: the lack of diverse, high-quality labeled data. In this work, we investigate the potential of domain-specific foundation models for dermatology in addressing this challenge. We utilize self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to pre-train models on a dataset of over 240,000 dermatological images from public and private collections. Our study considers several SSL methods and compares the resulting foundation models against domain-agnostic models like those pre-trained on ImageNet and state-of-the-art models such as MONET across 12 downstream tasks. Unlike previous research, we emphasize the development of smaller models that are more suitable for resource-limited clinical settings, facilitating easier adaptation to a broad range of use cases. Results show that models pre-trained in this work not only outperform general-purpose models but also approach the performance of models 50 times larger on clinically relevant diagnostic tasks. To promote further research in this direction, we publicly release both the training code and the foundation models, which can benefit clinicians in dermatological applications.</description>

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are stored in various database systems with different database models on heterogeneous storage architectures, such as relational databases, document stores, or graph databases. These different database models have a big impact on query complexity and performance. While this has been a known fact in database research, its implications for the growing number of Text-to-Query systems have surprisingly not been investigated so far. In this paper, we present SM3-Text-to-Query, the first multi-model medical Text-to-Query benchmark based on synthetic patient data from Synthea, following the SNOMED-CT taxonomy -- a widely used knowledge graph ontology covering medical terminology. SM3-Text-to-Query provides data representations for relational databases (PostgreSQL), document stores (MongoDB), and graph databases (Neo4j and GraphDB (RDF)), allowing the evaluation across four popular query languages, namely SQL, MQL, Cypher, and SPARQL. We systematically and manually develop 408 template questions, which we augment to construct a benchmark of 10K diverse natural language question/query pairs for these four query languages (40K pairs overall). On our dataset, we evaluate several common in-context-learning (ICL) approaches for a set of representative closed and open-source LLMs. Our evaluation sheds light on the trade-offs between database models and query languages for different ICL strategies and LLMs. Last, SM3-Text-to-Query is easily extendable to additional query languages or real, standard-based patient databases.</description>

      <title>CRepair: CVAE-based Automatic Vulnerability Repair Technology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software vulnerabilities are flaws in computer software systems that pose significant threats to the integrity, security, and reliability of modern software and its application data. These vulnerabilities can lead to substantial economic losses across various industries. Manual vulnerability repair is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors. To address the challenges of vulnerability repair, researchers have proposed various solutions, with learning-based automatic vulnerability repair techniques gaining widespread attention. However, existing methods often focus on learning more vulnerability data to improve repair outcomes, while neglecting the diverse characteristics of vulnerable code, and suffer from imprecise vulnerability localization.To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes CRepair, a CVAE-based automatic vulnerability repair technology aimed at fixing security vulnerabilities in system code. We first preprocess the vulnerability data using a prompt-based method to serve as input to the model. Then, we apply causal inference techniques to map the vulnerability feature data to probability distributions. By employing multi-sample feature fusion, we capture diverse vulnerability feature information. Finally, conditional control is used to guide the model in repairing the vulnerabilities.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms other benchmark models, achieving a perfect repair rate of 52%. The effectiveness of the approach is validated from multiple perspectives, advancing AI-driven code vulnerability repair and showing promising applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to different seasons, illumination, and atmospheric conditions, the photometric of the acquired image varies greatly, which leads to obvious stitching seams at the edges of the mosaic image. Traditional methods can be divided into two categories, one is absolute radiation correction and the other is relative radiation normalization. We propose a NeRF-based method of color consistency correction for multi-view images, which weaves image features together using implicit expressions, and then re-illuminates feature space to generate a fusion image with a new perspective. We chose Superview-1 satellite images and UAV images with large range and time difference for the experiment. Experimental results show that the synthesize image generated by our method has excellent visual effect and smooth color transition at the edges.</description>

      <title>Training objective drives the consistency of representational similarity across datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis claims that recent foundation models are converging to a shared representation space as a function of their downstream task performance, irrespective of the objectives and data modalities used to train these models. Representational similarity is generally measured for individual datasets and is not necessarily consistent across datasets. Thus, one may wonder whether this convergence of model representations is confounded by the datasets commonly used in machine learning. Here, we propose a systematic way to measure how representational similarity between models varies with the set of stimuli used to construct the representations. We find that the objective function is the most crucial factor in determining the consistency of representational similarities across datasets. Specifically, self-supervised vision models learn representations whose relative pairwise similarities generalize better from one dataset to another compared to those of image classification or image-text models. Moreover, the correspondence between representational similarities and the models' task behavior is dataset-dependent, being most strongly pronounced for single-domain datasets. Our work provides a framework for systematically measuring similarities of model representations across datasets and linking those similarities to differences in task behavior.</description>

      <title>Open-set object detection: towards unified problem formulation and benchmarking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-world applications where confidence is key, like autonomous driving, the accurate detection and appropriate handling of classes differing from those used during training are crucial. Despite the proposal of various unknown object detection approaches, we have observed widespread inconsistencies among them regarding the datasets, metrics, and scenarios used, alongside a notable absence of a clear definition for unknown objects, which hampers meaningful evaluation. To counter these issues, we introduce two benchmarks: a unified VOC-COCO evaluation, and the new OpenImagesRoad benchmark which provides clear hierarchical object definition besides new evaluation metrics. Complementing the benchmark, we exploit recent self-supervised Vision Transformers performance, to improve pseudo-labeling-based OpenSet Object Detection (OSOD), through OW-DETR++. State-of-the-art methods are extensively evaluated on the proposed benchmarks. This study provides a clear problem definition, ensures consistent evaluations, and draws new conclusions about effectiveness of OSOD strategies.</description>

      <title>Tangled Program Graphs as an alternative to DRL-based control algorithms for UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is currently the most popular AI-based approach to autonomous vehicle control. An agent, trained for this purpose in simulation, can interact with the real environment with a human-level performance. Despite very good results in terms of selected metrics, this approach has some significant drawbacks: high computational requirements and low explainability. Because of that, a DRL-based agent cannot be used in some control tasks, especially when safety is the key issue. Therefore we propose to use Tangled Program Graphs (TPGs) as an alternative for deep reinforcement learning in control-related tasks. In this approach, input signals are processed by simple programs that are combined in a graph structure. As a result, TPGs are less computationally demanding and their actions can be explained based on the graph structure. In this paper, we present our studies on the use of TPGs as an alternative for DRL in control-related tasks. In particular, we consider the problem of navigating an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) through the unknown environment based solely on the on-board LiDAR sensor. The results of our work show promising prospects for the use of TPGs in control related-tasks.</description>

      <title>Expectation vs. Reality: Towards Verification of Psychological Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Game theory provides an effective way to model strategic interactions among rational agents. In the context of formal verification, these ideas can be used to produce guarantees on the correctness of multi-agent systems, with a diverse range of applications from computer security to autonomous driving. Psychological games (PGs) were developed as a way to model and analyse agents with belief-dependent motivations, opening up the possibility to model how human emotions can influence behaviour. In PGs, players' utilities depend not only on what actually happens (which strategies players choose to adopt), but also on what the players had expected to happen (their belief as to the strategies that would be played). Despite receiving much attention in fields such as economics and psychology, very little consideration has been given to their applicability to problems in computer science, nor to practical algorithms and tool support. In this paper, we start to bridge that gap, proposing methods to solve PGs and implementing them within PRISM-games, a formal verification tool for stochastic games. We discuss how to model these games, highlight specific challenges for their analysis and illustrate the usefulness of our approach on several case studies, including human behaviour in traffic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Acceleration for Deep Reinforcement Learning using Parallel and Distributed Computing: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has led to dramatic breakthroughs in the field of artificial intelligence for the past few years. As the amount of rollout experience data and the size of neural networks for deep reinforcement learning have grown continuously, handling the training process and reducing the time consumption using parallel and distributed computing is becoming an urgent and essential desire. In this paper, we perform a broad and thorough investigation on training acceleration methodologies for deep reinforcement learning based on parallel and distributed computing, providing a comprehensive survey in this field with state-of-the-art methods and pointers to core references. In particular, a taxonomy of literature is provided, along with a discussion of emerging topics and open issues. This incorporates learning system architectures, simulation parallelism, computing parallelism, distributed synchronization mechanisms, and deep evolutionary reinforcement learning. Further, we compare 16 current open-source libraries and platforms with criteria of facilitating rapid development. Finally, we extrapolate future directions that deserve further research.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation Neural Network for Predicting Car-following Behaviour of Human-driven and Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As we move towards a mixed-traffic scenario of Autonomous vehicles (AVs) and Human-driven vehicles (HDVs), understanding the car-following behaviour is important to improve traffic efficiency and road safety. Using a real-world trajectory dataset, this study uses descriptive and statistical analysis to investigate the car-following behaviours of three vehicle pairs: HDV-AV, AV-HDV and HDV-HDV in mixed traffic. The ANOVA test showed that car-following behaviours across different vehicle pairs are statistically significant (p-value &lt; 0.05).
  We also introduce a data-driven Knowledge Distillation Neural Network (KDNN) model for predicting car-following behaviour in terms of speed. The KDNN model demonstrates comparable predictive accuracy to its teacher network, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, and outperforms both the standalone student network, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and traditional physics-based models like the Gipps model. Notably, the KDNN model better prevents collisions, measured by minimum Time-to-Collision (TTC), and operates with lower computational power, making it ideal for AVs or driving simulators requiring efficient computing.</description>

      <title>SynDroneVision: A Synthetic Dataset for Image-Based Drone Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing robust drone detection systems is often constrained by the limited availability of large-scale annotated training data and the high costs associated with real-world data collection. However, leveraging synthetic data generated via game engine-based simulations provides a promising and cost-effective solution to overcome this issue. Therefore, we present SynDroneVision, a synthetic dataset specifically designed for RGB-based drone detection in surveillance applications. Featuring diverse backgrounds, lighting conditions, and drone models, SynDroneVision offers a comprehensive training foundation for deep learning algorithms. To evaluate the dataset's effectiveness, we perform a comparative analysis across a selection of recent YOLO detection models. Our findings demonstrate that SynDroneVision is a valuable resource for real-world data enrichment, achieving notable enhancements in model performance and robustness, while significantly reducing the time and costs of real-world data acquisition. SynDroneVision will be publicly released upon paper acceptance.</description>

      <title>The influence of persona and conversational task on social interactions with a LLM-controlled embodied conversational agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in conversational tasks. Embodying an LLM as a virtual human allows users to engage in face-to-face social interactions in Virtual Reality. However, the influence of person- and task-related factors in social interactions with LLM-controlled agents remains unclear. In this study, forty-six participants interacted with a virtual agent whose persona was manipulated as extravert or introvert in three different conversational tasks (small talk, knowledge test, convincing). Social-evaluation, emotional experience, and realism were assessed using ratings. Interactive engagement was measured by quantifying participants' words and conversational turns. Finally, we measured participants' willingness to ask the agent for help during the knowledge test. Our findings show that the extraverted agent was more positively evaluated, elicited a more pleasant experience and greater engagement, and was assessed as more realistic compared to the introverted agent. Whereas persona did not affect the tendency to ask for help, participants were generally more confident in the answer when they had help of the LLM. Variation of personality traits of LLM-controlled embodied virtual agents, therefore, affects social-emotional processing and behavior in virtual interactions. Embodied virtual agents allow the presentation of naturalistic social encounters in a virtual environment.</description>

      <title>Improving Molecular Graph Generation with Flow Matching and Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating molecular graphs is crucial in drug design and discovery but remains challenging due to the complex interdependencies between nodes and edges. While diffusion models have demonstrated their potentiality in molecular graph design, they often suffer from unstable training and inefficient sampling. To enhance generation performance and training stability, we propose GGFlow, a discrete flow matching generative model incorporating optimal transport for molecular graphs and it incorporates an edge-augmented graph transformer to enable the direct communications among chemical bounds. Additionally, GGFlow introduces a novel goal-guided generation framework to control the generative trajectory of our model, aiming to design novel molecular structures with the desired properties. GGFlow demonstrates superior performance on both unconditional and conditional molecule generation tasks, outperforming existing baselines and underscoring its effectiveness and potential for wider application.</description>

      <title>Tell What You Hear From What You See -- Video to Audio Generation Through Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The content of visual and audio scenes is multi-faceted such that a video can be paired with various audio and vice-versa. Thereby, in video-to-audio generation task, it is imperative to introduce steering approaches for controlling the generated audio. While Video-to-Audio generation is a well-established generative task, existing methods lack such controllability. In this work, we propose VATT, a multi-modal generative framework that takes a video and an optional text prompt as input, and generates audio and optional textual description of the audio. Such a framework has two advantages: i) Video-to-Audio generation process can be refined and controlled via text which complements the context of visual information, and ii) The model can suggest what audio to generate for the video by generating audio captions. VATT consists of two key modules: VATT Converter, a LLM that is fine-tuned for instructions and includes a projection layer that maps video features to the LLM vector space; and VATT Audio, a transformer that generates audio tokens from visual frames and from optional text prompt using iterative parallel decoding. The audio tokens are converted to a waveform by pretrained neural codec. Experiments show that when VATT is compared to existing video-to-audio generation methods in objective metrics, it achieves competitive performance when the audio caption is not provided. When the audio caption is provided as a prompt, VATT achieves even more refined performance (lowest KLD score of 1.41). Furthermore, subjective studies show that VATT Audio has been chosen as preferred generated audio than audio generated by existing methods. VATT enables controllable video-to-audio generation through text as well as suggesting text prompts for videos through audio captions, unlocking novel applications such as text-guided video-to-audio generation and video-to-audio captioning.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Distributed Common Operational Picture from Heterogeneous Platforms using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of unmanned platforms equipped with advanced sensors promises to enhance situational awareness and mitigate the "fog of war" in military operations. However, managing the vast influx of data from these platforms poses a significant challenge for Command and Control (C2) systems. This study presents a novel multi-agent learning framework to address this challenge. Our method enables autonomous and secure communication between agents and humans, which in turn enables real-time formation of an interpretable Common Operational Picture (COP). Each agent encodes its perceptions and actions into compact vectors, which are then transmitted, received and decoded to form a COP encompassing the current state of all agents (friendly and enemy) on the battlefield. Using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), we jointly train COP models and agent's action selection policies. We demonstrate resilience to degraded conditions such as denied GPS and disrupted communications. Experimental validation is performed in the Starcraft-2 simulation environment to evaluate the precision of the COPs and robustness of policies. We report less than 5% error in COPs and policies resilient to various adversarial conditions. In summary, our contributions include a method for autonomous COP formation, increased resilience through distributed prediction, and joint training of COP models and multi-agent RL policies. This research advances adaptive and resilient C2, facilitating effective control of heterogeneous unmanned platforms.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes Asterisk, a compact GPT-based model for generating text embeddings. The model uses a minimalist architecture with two layers, two attention heads, and 256 embedding dimensions. By applying knowledge distillation from larger pretrained models, we explore the trade-offs between model size and performance while minimizing computational and memory requirements. The model is primarily evaluated and optimized for classification tasks, with experimental results showing its moderate performance in zero-shot classification across various downstream applications. With additional configuration, the model performance can approach or even surpass that of larger architectures on specific classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Visual-TCAV: Concept-based Attribution and Saliency Maps for Post-hoc Explainability in Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have seen significant performance improvements in recent years. However, due to their size and complexity, they function as black-boxes, leading to transparency concerns. State-of-the-art saliency methods generate local explanations that highlight the area in the input image where a class is identified but cannot explain how a concept of interest contributes to the prediction, which is essential for bias mitigation. On the other hand, concept-based methods, such as TCAV (Testing with Concept Activation Vectors), provide insights into how sensitive is the network to a concept, but cannot compute its attribution in a specific prediction nor show its location within the input image. This paper introduces a novel post-hoc explainability framework, Visual-TCAV, which aims to bridge the gap between these methods by providing both local and global explanations for CNN-based image classification. Visual-TCAV uses Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) to generate saliency maps that show where concepts are recognized by the network. Moreover, it can estimate the attribution of these concepts to the output of any class using a generalization of Integrated Gradients. This framework is evaluated on popular CNN architectures, with its validity further confirmed via experiments where ground truth for explanations is known, and a comparison with TCAV. Our code will be made available soon.</description>

      <title>A Retrospective on the Robot Air Hockey Challenge: Benchmarking Robust, Reliable, and Safe Learning Techniques for Real-world Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning methods have a groundbreaking impact in many application domains, but their application on real robotic platforms is still limited. Despite the many challenges associated with combining machine learning technology with robotics, robot learning remains one of the most promising directions for enhancing the capabilities of robots. When deploying learning-based approaches on real robots, extra effort is required to address the challenges posed by various real-world factors. To investigate the key factors influencing real-world deployment and to encourage original solutions from different researchers, we organized the Robot Air Hockey Challenge at the NeurIPS 2023 conference. We selected the air hockey task as a benchmark, encompassing low-level robotics problems and high-level tactics. Different from other machine learning-centric benchmarks, participants need to tackle practical challenges in robotics, such as the sim-to-real gap, low-level control issues, safety problems, real-time requirements, and the limited availability of real-world data. Furthermore, we focus on a dynamic environment, removing the typical assumption of quasi-static motions of other real-world benchmarks. The competition's results show that solutions combining learning-based approaches with prior knowledge outperform those relying solely on data when real-world deployment is challenging. Our ablation study reveals which real-world factors may be overlooked when building a learning-based solution. The successful real-world air hockey deployment of best-performing agents sets the foundation for future competitions and follow-up research directions.</description>

      <title>Aioli: A Unified Optimization Framework for Language Model Data Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language model performance depends on identifying the optimal mixture of data groups to train on (e.g., law, code, math). Prior work has proposed a diverse set of methods to efficiently learn mixture proportions, ranging from fitting regression models over training runs to dynamically updating proportions throughout training. Surprisingly, we find that no existing method consistently outperforms a simple stratified sampling baseline in terms of average test perplexity per group. In this paper, we study the cause of this inconsistency by unifying existing methods into a standard optimization framework. We show that all methods set proportions to minimize total loss, subject to a method-specific mixing law -- an assumption on how loss is a function of mixture proportions. We find that existing parameterizations of mixing laws can express the true loss-proportion relationship empirically, but the methods themselves often set the mixing law parameters inaccurately, resulting in poor and inconsistent performance. Finally, we leverage the insights from our framework to derive a new online method named Aioli, which directly estimates the mixing law parameters throughout training and uses them to dynamically adjust proportions. Empirically, Aioli outperforms stratified sampling on 6 out of 6 datasets by an average of 0.28 test perplexity points, whereas existing methods fail to consistently beat stratified sampling, doing up to 6.9 points worse. Moreover, in a practical setting where proportions are learned on shorter runs due to computational constraints, Aioli can dynamically adjust these proportions over the full training run, consistently improving performance over existing methods by up to 12.01 test perplexity points.</description>

      <title>Topology-aware Reinforcement Feature Space Reconstruction for Graph Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature space is an environment where data points are vectorized to represent the original dataset. Reconstructing a good feature space is essential to augment the AI power of data, improve model generalization, and increase the availability of downstream ML models. Existing literature, such as feature transformation and feature selection, is labor-intensive (e.g., heavy reliance on empirical experience) and mostly designed for tabular data. Moreover, these methods regard data samples as independent, which ignores the unique topological structure when applied to graph data, thus resulting in a suboptimal reconstruction feature space. Can we consider the topological information to automatically reconstruct feature space for graph data without heavy experiential knowledge? To fill this gap, we leverage topology-aware reinforcement learning to automate and optimize feature space reconstruction for graph data. Our approach combines the extraction of core subgraphs to capture essential structural information with a graph neural network (GNN) to encode topological features and reduce computing complexity. Then we introduce three reinforcement agents within a hierarchical structure to systematically generate meaningful features through an iterative process, effectively reconstructing the feature space.

      <title>Continuous-Time Analysis of Adaptive Optimization and Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive optimization algorithms, particularly Adam and its variant AdamW, are fundamental components of modern deep learning. However, their training dynamics lack comprehensive theoretical understanding, with limited insight into why common practices - such as specific hyperparameter choices and normalization layers - contribute to successful generalization. This work presents a continuous-time formulation of Adam and AdamW, facilitating a tractable analysis of training dynamics that can shed light on such practical questions. We theoretically derive a stable region for Adam's hyperparameters $(\beta, \gamma)$ that ensures bounded updates, empirically verifying these predictions by observing unstable exponential growth of parameter updates outside this region. Furthermore, we theoretically justify the success of normalization layers by uncovering an implicit meta-adaptive effect of scale-invariant architectural components. This insight leads to an explicit optimizer, $2$-Adam, which we generalize to $k$-Adam - an optimizer that applies an adaptive normalization procedure $k$ times, encompassing Adam (corresponding to $k=1$) and Adam with a normalization layer (corresponding to $k=2$). Overall, our continuous-time formulation of Adam facilitates a principled analysis, offering deeper understanding of optimal hyperparameter choices and architectural decisions in modern deep learning.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dimensional Reconfigurable, Physically Composable Hybrid Diffractive Optical Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs), leveraging free-space light wave propagation for ultra-parallel, high-efficiency computing, have emerged as promising artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators. However, their inherent lack of reconfigurability due to fixed optical structures post-fabrication hinders practical deployment in the face of dynamic AI workloads and evolving applications. To overcome this challenge, we introduce, for the first time, a multi-dimensional reconfigurable hybrid diffractive ONN system (MDR-HDONN), a physically composable architecture that unlocks a new degree of freedom and unprecedented versatility in DONNs. By leveraging full-system learnability, MDR-HDONN repurposes fixed fabricated optical hardware, achieving exponentially expanded functionality and superior task adaptability through the differentiable learning of system variables. Furthermore, MDR-HDONN adopts a hybrid optical/photonic design, combining the reconfigurability of integrated photonics with the ultra-parallelism of free-space diffractive systems. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MDR-HDONN has digital-comparable accuracy on various task adaptations with 74x faster speed and 194x lower energy. Compared to prior DONNs, MDR-HDONN shows exponentially larger functional space with 5x faster training speed, paving the way for a new paradigm of versatile, composable, hybrid optical/photonic AI computing. We will open-source our codes.</description>

      <title>On Differentially Private String Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a database of bit strings $A_1,\ldots,A_m\in \{0,1\}^n$, a fundamental data structure task is to estimate the distances between a given query $B\in \{0,1\}^n$ with all the strings in the database. In addition, one might further want to ensure the integrity of the database by releasing these distance statistics in a secure manner. In this work, we propose differentially private (DP) data structures for this type of tasks, with a focus on Hamming and edit distance. On top of the strong privacy guarantees, our data structures are also time- and space-efficient. In particular, our data structure is $\epsilon$-DP against any sequence of queries of arbitrary length, and for any query $B$ such that the maximum distance to any string in the database is at most $k$, we output $m$ distance estimates. Moreover,
  - For Hamming distance, our data structure answers any query in $\widetilde O(mk+n)$ time and each estimate deviates from the true distance by at most $\widetilde O(k/e^{\epsilon/\log k})$;
  - For edit distance, our data structure answers any query in $\widetilde O(mk^2+n)$ time and each estimate deviates from the true distance by at most $\widetilde O(k/e^{\epsilon/(\log k \log n)})$.
  For moderate $k$, both data structures support sublinear query operations. We obtain these results via a novel adaptation of the randomized response technique as a bit flipping procedure, applied to the sketched strings.</description>

      <title>Fact or Fiction? Can LLMs be Reliable Annotators for Political Truths?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Political misinformation poses significant challenges to democratic processes, shaping public opinion and trust in media. Manual fact-checking methods face issues of scalability and annotator bias, while machine learning models require large, costly labelled datasets. This study investigates the use of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) as reliable annotators for detecting political factuality in news articles. Using open-source LLMs, we create a politically diverse dataset, labelled for bias through LLM-generated annotations. These annotations are validated by human experts and further evaluated by LLM-based judges to assess the accuracy and reliability of the annotations. Our approach offers a scalable and robust alternative to traditional fact-checking, enhancing transparency and public trust in media.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Assessment of Intersectional Empathetic Bias and Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A growing amount of literature critiques the current operationalizations of empathy based on loose definitions of the construct. Such definitions negatively affect dataset quality, model robustness, and evaluation reliability. We propose an empathy evaluation framework that operationalizes empathy close to its psychological origins. The framework measures the variance in responses of LLMs to prompts using existing metrics for empathy and emotional valence. The variance is introduced through the controlled generation of the prompts by varying social biases affecting context understanding, thus impacting empathetic understanding. The control over generation ensures high theoretical validity of the constructs in the prompt dataset. Also, it makes high-quality translation, especially into languages that currently have little-to-no way of evaluating empathy or bias, such as the Slavonic family, more manageable. Using chosen LLMs and various prompt types, we demonstrate the empathy evaluation with the framework, including multiple-choice answers and free generation. The variance in our initial evaluation sample is small and we were unable to measure convincing differences between the empathetic understanding in contexts given by different social groups. However, the results are promising because the models showed significant alterations their reasoning chains needed to capture the relatively subtle changes in the prompts. This provides the basis for future research into the construction of the evaluation sample and statistical methods for measuring the results.</description>

      <title>GazeSearch: Radiology Findings Search Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical eye-tracking data is an important information source for understanding how radiologists visually interpret medical images. This information not only improves the accuracy of deep learning models for X-ray analysis but also their interpretability, enhancing transparency in decision-making. However, the current eye-tracking data is dispersed, unprocessed, and ambiguous, making it difficult to derive meaningful insights. Therefore, there is a need to create a new dataset with more focus and purposeful eyetracking data, improving its utility for diagnostic applications. In this work, we propose a refinement method inspired by the target-present visual search challenge: there is a specific finding and fixations are guided to locate it. After refining the existing eye-tracking datasets, we transform them into a curated visual search dataset, called GazeSearch, specifically for radiology findings, where each fixation sequence is purposefully aligned to the task of locating a particular finding. Subsequently, we introduce a scan path prediction baseline, called ChestSearch, specifically tailored to GazeSearch. Finally, we employ the newly introduced GazeSearch as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of current state-of-the-art methods, offering a comprehensive assessment for visual search in the medical imaging domain.</description>

      <title>Using Language Models to Disambiguate Lexical Choices in Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In translation, a concept represented by a single word in a source language can have multiple variations in a target language. The task of lexical selection requires using context to identify which variation is most appropriate for a source text. We work with native speakers of nine languages to create DTAiLS, a dataset of 1,377 sentence pairs that exhibit cross-lingual concept variation when translating from English. We evaluate recent LLMs and neural machine translation systems on DTAiLS, with the best-performing model, GPT-4, achieving from 67 to 85% accuracy across languages. Finally, we use language models to generate English rules describing target-language concept variations. Providing weaker models with high-quality lexical rules improves accuracy substantially, in some cases reaching or outperforming GPT-4.</description>

      <title>ASL STEM Wiki: Dataset and Benchmark for Interpreting STEM Articles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) students face significant barriers in accessing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, notably due to the scarcity of STEM resources in signed languages. To help address this, we introduce ASL STEM Wiki: a parallel corpus of 254 Wikipedia articles on STEM topics in English, interpreted into over 300 hours of American Sign Language (ASL). ASL STEM Wiki is the first continuous signing dataset focused on STEM, facilitating the development of AI resources for STEM education in ASL. We identify several use cases of ASL STEM Wiki with human-centered applications. For example, because this dataset highlights the frequent use of fingerspelling for technical concepts, which inhibits DHH students' ability to learn, we develop models to identify fingerspelled words -- which can later be used to query for appropriate ASL signs to suggest to interpreters.</description>

Abstract: Warning: this paper contains content that may be inappropriate or offensive. As generative models become available for public use in various applications, testing and analyzing vulnerabilities of these models has become a priority. In this work, we propose an automatic red teaming framework that evaluates a given black-box model and exposes its vulnerabilities against unsafe and inappropriate content generation. Our framework uses in-context learning in a feedback loop to red team models and trigger them into unsafe content generation. In particular, taking text-to-image models as target models, we explore different feedback mechanisms to automatically learn effective and diverse adversarial prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that even with enhanced safety features, Stable Diffusion (SD) models are vulnerable to our adversarial prompts, raising concerns on their robustness in practical uses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed framework is effective for red teaming text-to-text models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How can we build AI systems that can learn any set of individual human values both quickly and safely, avoiding causing harm or violating societal standards for acceptable behavior during the learning process? We explore the effects of representational alignment between humans and AI agents on learning human values. Making AI systems learn human-like representations of the world has many known benefits, including improving generalization, robustness to domain shifts, and few-shot learning performance. We demonstrate that this kind of representational alignment can also support safely learning and exploring human values in the context of personalization. We begin with a theoretical prediction, show that it applies to learning human morality judgments, then show that our results generalize to ten different aspects of human values -- including ethics, honesty, and fairness -- training AI agents on each set of values in a multi-armed bandit setting, where rewards reflect human value judgments over the chosen action. Using a set of textual action descriptions, we collect value judgments from humans, as well as similarity judgments from both humans and multiple language models, and demonstrate that representational alignment enables both safe exploration and improved generalization when learning human values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07510v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent capability increases in large language models (LLMs) open up applications in which groups of communicating generative AI agents solve joint tasks. This poses privacy and security challenges concerning the unauthorised sharing of information, or other unwanted forms of agent coordination. Modern steganographic techniques could render such dynamics hard to detect. In this paper, we comprehensively formalise the problem of secret collusion in systems of generative AI agents by drawing on relevant concepts from both AI and security literature. We study incentives for the use of steganography, and propose a variety of mitigation measures. Our investigations result in a model evaluation framework that systematically tests capabilities required for various forms of secret collusion. We provide extensive empirical results across a range of contemporary LLMs. While the steganographic capabilities of current models remain limited, GPT-4 displays a capability jump suggesting the need for continuous monitoring of steganographic frontier model capabilities. We conclude by laying out a comprehensive research program to mitigate future risks of collusion between generative AI models.</description>

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models exhibit remarkable capabilities but struggle with hallucinations inconsistencies between images and their descriptions. Previous hallucination evaluation studies on LVLMs have identified hallucinations in terms of objects, attributes, and relations but overlooked complex hallucinations that create an entire narrative around a fictional entity. In this paper, we introduce a refined taxonomy of hallucinations, featuring a new category: Event Hallucination. We then utilize advanced LLMs to generate and filter fine grained hallucinatory data consisting of various types of hallucinations, with a particular focus on event hallucinations, laying the groundwork for integrating discriminative and generative evaluation methods within our universal evaluation framework. The proposed benchmark distinctively assesses LVLMs ability to tackle a broad spectrum of hallucinations, making it a reliable and comprehensive tool for gauging LVLMs efficacy in handling hallucinations. We will release our code and data.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Energy Consumption Modelling for Electric Micromobility using an Open Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The escalating challenges of traffic congestion and environmental degradation underscore the critical importance of embracing E-Mobility solutions in urban spaces. In particular, micro E-Mobility tools such as E-scooters and E-bikes, play a pivotal role in this transition, offering sustainable alternatives for urban commuters. However, the energy consumption patterns for these tools are a critical aspect that impacts their effectiveness in real-world scenarios and is essential for trip planning and boosting user confidence in using these. To this effect, recent studies have utilised physical models customised for specific mobility tools and conditions, but these models struggle with generalization and effectiveness in real-world scenarios due to a notable absence of open datasets for thorough model evaluation and verification. To fill this gap, our work presents an open dataset, collected in Dublin, Ireland, specifically designed for energy modelling research related to E-Scooters and E-Bikes. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption modelling based on the dataset using a set of representative machine learning algorithms and compare their performance against the contemporary mathematical models as a baseline. Our results demonstrate a notable advantage for data-driven models in comparison to the corresponding mathematical models for estimating energy consumption. Specifically, data-driven models outperform physical models in accuracy by up to 83.83% for E-Bikes and 82.16% for E-Scooters based on an in-depth analysis of the dataset under certain assumptions.</description>

      <title>BehaviorGPT: Smart Agent Simulation for Autonomous Driving with Next-Patch Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating realistic interactions among traffic agents is crucial for efficiently validating the safety of autonomous driving systems. Existing leading simulators primarily use an encoder-decoder structure to encode the historical trajectories for future simulation. However, such a paradigm complicates the model architecture, and the manual separation of history and future trajectories leads to low data utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Behavior Generative Pre-trained Transformers (BehaviorGPT), a decoder-only, autoregressive architecture designed to simulate the sequential motion of multiple agents. Crucially, our approach discards the traditional separation between "history" and "future," treating each time step as the "current" one, resulting in a simpler, more parameter- and data-efficient design that scales seamlessly with data and computation. Additionally, we introduce the Next-Patch Prediction Paradigm (NP3), which enables models to reason at the patch level of trajectories and capture long-range spatial-temporal interactions. BehaviorGPT ranks first across several metrics on the Waymo Sim Agents Benchmark, demonstrating its exceptional performance in multi-agent and agent-map interactions. We outperformed state-of-the-art models with a realism score of 0.741 and improved the minADE metric to 1.540, with an approximately 91.6% reduction in model parameters.</description>

Abstract: Symbolic planners can discover a sequence of actions from initial to goal states given expert-defined, domain-specific logical action semantics. Large Language Models (LLMs) can directly generate such sequences, but limitations in reasoning and state-tracking often result in plans that are insufficient or unexecutable. We propose Predicting Semantics of Actions with Language Models (PSALM), which automatically learns action semantics by leveraging the strengths of both symbolic planners and LLMs. PSALM repeatedly proposes and executes plans, using the LLM to partially generate plans and to infer domain-specific action semantics based on execution outcomes. PSALM maintains a belief over possible action semantics that is iteratively updated until a goal state is reached. Experiments on 7 environments show that when learning just from one goal, PSALM boosts plan success rate from 36.4% (on Claude-3.5) to 100%, and explores the environment more efficiently than prior work to infer ground truth domain action semantics.</description>

      <title>Untrained neural networks can demonstrate memorization-independent abstract reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of abstract reasoning is a matter of debate. Modern artificial neural network (ANN) models, like large language models, demonstrate impressive success when tested on abstract reasoning problems. However, it has been argued that their success reflects some form of memorization of similar problems (data contamination) rather than a general-purpose abstract reasoning capability. This concern is supported by evidence of brittleness, and the requirement of extensive training. In our study, we explored whether abstract reasoning can be achieved using the toolbox of ANNs, without prior training. Specifically, we studied an ANN model in which the weights of a naive network are optimized during the solution of the problem, using the problem data itself, rather than any prior knowledge. We tested this modeling approach on visual reasoning problems and found that it performs relatively well. Crucially, this success does not rely on memorization of similar problems. We further suggest an explanation of how it works. Finally, as problem solving is performed by changing the ANN weights, we explored the connection between problem solving and the accumulation of knowledge in the ANNs.</description>

Abstract: Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) is advocated as a unifying formalism for various forms of non-monotonic reasoning, including logic programming. It allows capturing defeasible knowledge, subject to argumentative debate. While, in much existing work, ABA frameworks are given up-front, in this paper we focus on the problem of automating their learning from background knowledge and positive/negative examples. Unlike prior work, we newly frame the problem in terms of brave reasoning under stable extensions for ABA. We present a novel algorithm based on transformation rules (such as Rote Learning, Folding, Assumption Introduction and Fact Subsumption) and an implementation thereof that makes use of Answer Set Programming. Finally, we compare our technique to state-of-the-art ILP systems that learn defeasible knowledge.</description>

Abstract: The success of large-scale language models like GPT can be attributed to their ability to efficiently predict the next token in a sequence. However, these models rely on constant computational effort regardless of the complexity of the token they are predicting, lacking the capacity for iterative refinement. In this paper, we introduce a novel Loop Neural Network, which achieves better performance by utilizing longer computational time without increasing the model size. Our approach revisits the input multiple times, refining the prediction by iteratively looping over a subset of the model with residual connections. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method through experiments comparing versions of GPT-2 with our loop models, showing improved performance in language modeling tasks while maintaining similar parameter counts. Importantly, these improvements are achieved without the need for extra training data.</description>

      <title>Soft-Label Integration for Robust Toxicity Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Toxicity classification in textual content remains a significant problem. Data with labels from a single annotator fall short of capturing the diversity of human perspectives. Therefore, there is a growing need to incorporate crowdsourced annotations for training an effective toxicity classifier. Additionally, the standard approach to training a classifier using empirical risk minimization (ERM) may fail to address the potential shifts between the training set and testing set due to exploiting spurious correlations. This work introduces a novel bi-level optimization framework that integrates crowdsourced annotations with the soft-labeling technique and optimizes the soft-label weights by Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GroupDRO) to enhance the robustness against out-of-distribution (OOD) risk. We theoretically prove the convergence of our bi-level optimization algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of both average and worst-group accuracy, confirming its effectiveness in leveraging crowdsourced annotations to achieve more effective and robust toxicity classification.</description>

      <title>Plasticity Loss in Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Akin to neuroplasticity in human brains, the plasticity of deep neural networks enables their quick adaption to new data. This makes plasticity particularly crucial for deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents: Once plasticity is lost, an agent's performance will inevitably plateau because it cannot improve its policy to account for changes in the data distribution, which are a necessary consequence of its learning process. Thus, developing well-performing and sample-efficient agents hinges on their ability to remain plastic during training. Furthermore, the loss of plasticity can be connected to many other issues plaguing deep RL, such as training instabilities, scaling failures, overestimation bias, and insufficient exploration. With this survey, we aim to provide an overview of the emerging research on plasticity loss for academics and practitioners of deep reinforcement learning. First, we propose a unified definition of plasticity loss based on recent works, relate it to definitions from the literature, and discuss metrics for measuring plasticity loss. Then, we categorize and discuss numerous possible causes of plasticity loss before reviewing currently employed mitigation strategies. Our taxonomy is the first systematic overview of the current state of the field. Lastly, we discuss prevalent issues within the literature, such as a necessity for broader evaluation, and provide recommendations for future research, like gaining a better understanding of an agent's neural activity and behavior.</description>

      <title>A Barrier Certificate-based Simplex Architecture for Systems with Approximate and Hybrid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Barrier-based Simplex (Bb-Simplex), a new, provably correct design for runtime assurance of continuous dynamical systems. Bb-Simplex is centered around the Simplex control architecture, which consists of a high-performance advanced controller that is not guaranteed to maintain safety of the plant, a verified-safe baseline controller, and a decision module that switches control of the plant between the two controllers to ensure safety without sacrificing performance. In Bb-Simplex, Barrier certificates are used to prove that the baseline controller ensures safety. Furthermore, Bb-Simplex features a new automated method for deriving, from the barrier certificate, the conditions for switching between the controllers. Our method is based on the Taylor expansion of the barrier certificate and yields computationally inexpensive switching conditions.
  We also propose extensions to Bb-Simplex to enable its use in hybrid systems, which have multiple modes each with its own dynamics, and to support its use when only approximate dynamics (not exact dynamics) are available, for both continuous-time and hybrid dynamical systems.
  We consider significant applications of Bb-Simplex to microgrids featuring advanced controllers in the form of neural networks trained using reinforcement learning. These microgrids are modeled in RTDS, an industry-standard high-fidelity, real-time power systems simulator. Our results demonstrate that Bb-Simplex can automatically derive switching conditions for complex continuous-time and hybrid systems, the switching conditions are not overly conservative, and Bb-Simplex ensures safety even in the presence of adversarial attacks on the neural controller when only approximate dynamics (with an error bound) are available.</description>

      <title>Consciousness is entailed by compositional learning of new causal structures in deep predictive processing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms have achieved superhuman performance in specific complex domains. However, learning online from few examples and compositional learning for efficient generalization across domains remain elusive. In humans, such learning includes specific declarative memory formation and is closely associated with consciousness. Predictive processing has been advanced as a principled Bayesian framework for understanding the cortex as implementing deep generative models for both sensory perception and action control. However, predictive processing offers little direct insight into fast compositional learning or of the separation between conscious and unconscious contents. Here, propose that access consciousness arises as a consequence of a particular learning mechanism operating within a predictive processing system. We extend predictive processing by adding online, single-example new structure learning via hierarchical binding of unpredicted inferences. This system learns new causes by quickly connecting together novel combinations of perceptions, which manifests as working memories that can become short- and long-term declarative memories retrievable by associative recall. The contents of such bound representations are unified yet differentiated, can be maintained by selective attention and are globally available. The proposed learning process explains contrast and masking manipulations, postdictive perceptual integration, and other paradigm cases of consciousness research. 'Phenomenal conscious experience' is how the learning system transparently models its own functioning, giving rise to perceptual illusions underlying the meta-problem of consciousness. Our proposal naturally unifies the feature binding, recurrent processing, predictive processing, and global workspace theories of consciousness.</description>

Abstract: This survey reviews the progress of diffusion models in generating images from text, ~\textit{i.e.} text-to-image diffusion models. As a self-contained work, this survey starts with a brief introduction of how diffusion models work for image synthesis, followed by the background for text-conditioned image synthesis. Based on that, we present an organized review of pioneering methods and their improvements on text-to-image generation. We further summarize applications beyond image generation, such as text-guided generation for various modalities like videos, and text-guided image editing. Beyond the progress made so far, we discuss existing challenges and promising future directions.</description>

      <title>Physically Realizable Natural-Looking Clothing Textures Evade Person Detectors via 3D Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works have proposed to craft adversarial clothes for evading person detectors, while they are either only effective at limited viewing angles or very conspicuous to humans. We aim to craft adversarial texture for clothes based on 3D modeling, an idea that has been used to craft rigid adversarial objects such as a 3D-printed turtle. Unlike rigid objects, humans and clothes are non-rigid, leading to difficulties in physical realization. In order to craft natural-looking adversarial clothes that can evade person detectors at multiple viewing angles, we propose adversarial camouflage textures (AdvCaT) that resemble one kind of the typical textures of daily clothes, camouflage textures. We leverage the Voronoi diagram and Gumbel-softmax trick to parameterize the camouflage textures and optimize the parameters via 3D modeling. Moreover, we propose an efficient augmentation pipeline on 3D meshes combining topologically plausible projection (TopoProj) and Thin Plate Spline (TPS) to narrow the gap between digital and real-world objects. We printed the developed 3D texture pieces on fabric materials and tailored them into T-shirts and trousers. Experiments show high attack success rates of these clothes against multiple detectors.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Link Prediction: A Data Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00793v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Link prediction, a fundamental task on graphs, has proven indispensable in various applications, e.g., friend recommendation, protein analysis, and drug interaction prediction. However, since datasets span a multitude of domains, they could have distinct underlying mechanisms of link formation. Evidence in existing literature underscores the absence of a universally best algorithm suitable for all datasets. In this paper, we endeavor to explore principles of link prediction across diverse datasets from a data-centric perspective. We recognize three fundamental factors critical to link prediction: local structural proximity, global structural proximity, and feature proximity. We then unearth relationships among those factors where (i) global structural proximity only shows effectiveness when local structural proximity is deficient. (ii) The incompatibility can be found between feature and structural proximity. Such incompatibility leads to GNNs for Link Prediction (GNN4LP) consistently underperforming on edges where the feature proximity factor dominates. Inspired by these new insights from a data perspective, we offer practical instruction for GNN4LP model design and guidelines for selecting appropriate benchmark datasets for more comprehensive evaluations.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Adaptation Induces Stronger Accuracy and Agreement-on-the-Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Miller et al. (2021) and Baek et al. (2022) empirically demonstrated strong linear correlations between in-distribution (ID) versus out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy and agreement. These trends, coined accuracy-on-the-line (ACL) and agreement-on-the-line (AGL), enable OOD model selection and performance estimation without labeled data. However, these phenomena also break for certain shifts, such as CIFAR10-C Gaussian Noise, posing a critical bottleneck. In this paper, we make a key finding that recent test-time adaptation (TTA) methods not only improve OOD performance, but drastically strengthen the ACL and AGL trends in models, even in shifts where models showed very weak correlations before. To analyze this, we revisit the theoretical conditions from Miller et al. (2021) that outline the types of distribution shifts needed for perfect ACL in linear models. Surprisingly, these conditions are satisfied after applying TTA to deep models in the penultimate feature embedding space. In particular, TTA causes the data distribution to collapse complex shifts into those can be expressed by a singular scaling variable in the feature space. Our results show that by combining TTA with AGL-based estimation methods, we can estimate the OOD performance of models with high precision for a broader set of distribution shifts. This lends us a simple system for selecting the best hyperparameters and adaptation strategy without any OOD labeled data.</description>

      <title>On Generative Agents in Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems are the cornerstone of today's information dissemination, yet a disconnect between offline metrics and online performance greatly hinders their development. Addressing this challenge, we envision a recommendation simulator, capitalizing on recent breakthroughs in human-level intelligence exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose Agent4Rec, a user simulator in recommendation, leveraging LLM-empowered generative agents equipped with user profile, memory, and actions modules specifically tailored for the recommender system. In particular, these agents' profile modules are initialized using real-world datasets (e.g. MovieLens, Steam, Amazon-Book), capturing users' unique tastes and social traits; memory modules log both factual and emotional memories and are integrated with an emotion-driven reflection mechanism; action modules support a wide variety of behaviors, spanning both taste-driven and emotion-driven actions. Each agent interacts with personalized recommender models in a page-by-page manner, relying on a pre-implemented collaborative filtering-based recommendation algorithm. We delve into both the capabilities and limitations of Agent4Rec, aiming to explore an essential research question: ``To what extent can LLM-empowered generative agents faithfully simulate the behavior of real, autonomous humans in recommender systems?'' Extensive and multi-faceted evaluations of Agent4Rec highlight both the alignment and deviation between agents and user-personalized preferences. Beyond mere performance comparison, we explore insightful experiments, such as emulating the filter bubble effect and discovering the underlying causal relationships in recommendation tasks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/LehengTHU/Agent4Rec.</description>

      <title>A Wireless AI-Generated Content (AIGC) Provisioning Framework Empowered by Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the significant advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) and the proliferation of mobile devices, providing high-quality AIGC services via wireless networks is becoming the future direction. However, the primary challenges of AIGC services provisioning in wireless networks lie in unstable channels, limited bandwidth resources, and unevenly distributed computational resources. To this end, this paper proposes a semantic communication (SemCom)-empowered AIGC (SemAIGC) generation and transmission framework, where only semantic information of the content rather than all the binary bits should be generated and transmitted by using SemCom. Specifically, SemAIGC integrates diffusion models within the semantic encoder and decoder to design a workload-adjustable transceiver thereby allowing adjustment of computational resource utilization in edge and local. In addition, a Resource-aware wOrklOad Trade-off (ROOT) scheme is devised to intelligently make workload adaptation decisions for the transceiver, thus efficiently generating, transmitting, and fine-tuning content as per dynamic wireless channel conditions and service requirements. Simulations verify the superiority of our proposed SemAIGC framework in terms of latency and content quality compared to conventional approaches.</description>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful tool for finding optimal policies in sequential decision processes. However, deep RL methods have two weaknesses: collecting the amount of agent experience required for practical RL problems is prohibitively expensive, and the learned policies exhibit poor generalization on tasks outside the training data distribution. To mitigate these issues, we introduce automaton distillation, a form of neuro-symbolic transfer learning in which Q-value estimates from a teacher are distilled into a low-dimensional representation in the form of an automaton. We then propose methods for generating Q-value estimates where symbolic information is extracted from a teacher's Deep Q-Network (DQN). The resulting Q-value estimates are used to bootstrap learning in the target discrete and continuous environment via a modified DQN and Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic (TD3) loss function, respectively. We demonstrate that automaton distillation decreases the time required to find optimal policies for various decision tasks in new environments, even in a target environment different in structure from the source environment.</description>

      <title>Towards Principled Graph Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10119v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph learning architectures based on the k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (k-WL) hierarchy offer a theoretically well-understood expressive power. However, such architectures often fail to deliver solid predictive performance on real-world tasks, limiting their practical impact. In contrast, global attention-based models such as graph transformers demonstrate strong performance in practice, but comparing their expressive power with the k-WL hierarchy remains challenging, particularly since these architectures rely on positional or structural encodings for their expressivity and predictive performance. To address this, we show that the recently proposed Edge Transformer, a global attention model operating on node pairs instead of nodes, has at least 3-WL expressive power. Empirically, we demonstrate that the Edge Transformer surpasses other theoretically aligned architectures regarding predictive performance while not relying on positional or structural encodings.

      <title>Robust Prompt Optimization for Defending Language Models Against Jailbreaking Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17263v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite advances in AI alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks or jailbreaking, in which adversaries can modify prompts to induce unwanted behavior. While some defenses have been proposed, they have not been adapted to newly proposed attacks and more challenging threat models. To address this, we propose an optimization-based objective for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, Robust Prompt Optimization (RPO) to create robust system-level defenses. Our approach directly incorporates the adversary into the defensive objective and optimizes a lightweight and transferable suffix, enabling RPO to adapt to worst-case adaptive attacks. Our theoretical and experimental results show improved robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4 to 6% and Llama-2 to 0% on JailbreakBench, setting the state-of-the-art.

      <title>Fairness Without Harm: An Influence-Guided Active Sampling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12789v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of fairness in machine learning (ML), ensuring that the models do not exhibit biases toward protected demographic groups, typically results in a compromise scenario. This compromise can be explained by a Pareto frontier where given certain resources (e.g., data), reducing the fairness violations often comes at the cost of lowering the model accuracy. In this work, we aim to train models that mitigate group fairness disparity without causing harm to model accuracy. Intuitively, acquiring more data is a natural and promising approach to achieve this goal by reaching a better Pareto frontier of the fairness-accuracy tradeoff. The current data acquisition methods, such as fair active learning approaches, typically require annotating sensitive attributes. However, these sensitive attribute annotations should be protected due to privacy and safety concerns. In this paper, we propose a tractable active data sampling algorithm that does not rely on training group annotations, instead only requiring group annotations on a small validation set. Specifically, the algorithm first scores each new example by its influence on fairness and accuracy evaluated on the validation dataset, and then selects a certain number of examples for training. We theoretically analyze how acquiring more data can improve fairness without causing harm, and validate the possibility of our sampling approach in the context of risk disparity. We also provide the upper bound of generalization error and risk disparity as well as the corresponding connections. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. Our code is available at https://github.com/UCSC-REAL/FairnessWithoutHarm.</description>

      <title>Emotion Classification in Low and Moderate Resource Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is important to be able to analyze the emotional state of people around the globe. There are 7100+ active languages spoken around the world and building emotion classification for each language is labor intensive. Particularly for low-resource and endangered languages, building emotion classification can be quite challenging. We present a cross-lingual emotion classifier, where we train an emotion classifier with resource-rich languages (i.e. \textit{English} in our work) and transfer the learning to low and moderate resource languages. We compare and contrast two approaches of transfer learning from a high-resource language to a low or moderate-resource language. One approach projects the annotation from a high-resource language to low and moderate-resource language in parallel corpora and the other one uses direct transfer from high-resource language to the other languages. We show the efficacy of our approaches on 6 languages: Farsi, Arabic, Spanish, Ilocano, Odia, and Azerbaijani. Our results indicate that our approaches outperform random baselines and transfer emotions across languages successfully. For all languages, the direct cross-lingual transfer of emotion yields better results. We also create annotated emotion-labeled resources for four languages: Farsi, Azerbaijani, Ilocano and Odia.</description>

      <title>Curry-DPO: Enhancing Alignment using Curriculum Learning &amp; Ranked Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an effective technique that leverages pairwise preference data (usually one chosen and rejected response pair per user prompt) to align LLMs to human preferences. In practice, multiple responses can exist for a given prompt with varying quality relative to each other. With availability of such quality ratings for multiple responses, we propose utilizing these responses to create multiple preference pairs for a given prompt. Our work focuses on systematically using the constructed multiple preference pair in DPO training via curriculum learning methodology. In particular, we order these multiple pairs of preference data from easy to hard (emulating curriculum training) according to various criteria. We show detailed comparisons of our proposed approach to the standard single-pair DPO setting. Our method, which we call Curry-DPO consistently shows increased performance gains on MTbench, Vicuna, WizardLM, and the UltraFeedback test set, highlighting its effectiveness. More specifically, Curry-DPO achieves a score of 7.43 on MT-bench with Zephy-7B model outperforming majority of existing LLMs with similar parameter size. Curry-DPO also achieves the highest adjusted win rates on Vicuna, WizardLM, and UltraFeedback test datasets (90.7%, 87.1%, and 87.9% respectively) in our experiments, with notable gains of upto 7.5% when compared to standard DPO technique.

      <title>Logits of API-Protected LLMs Leak Proprietary Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) providers often hide the architectural details and parameters of their proprietary models by restricting public access to a limited API. In this work we show that, with only a conservative assumption about the model architecture, it is possible to learn a surprisingly large amount of non-public information about an API-protected LLM from a relatively small number of API queries (e.g., costing under $1000 USD for OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo). Our findings are centered on one key observation: most modern LLMs suffer from a softmax bottleneck, which restricts the model outputs to a linear subspace of the full output space. We exploit this fact to unlock several capabilities, including (but not limited to) obtaining cheap full-vocabulary outputs, auditing for specific types of model updates, identifying the source LLM given a single full LLM output, and even efficiently discovering the LLM's hidden size. Our empirical investigations show the effectiveness of our methods, which allow us to estimate the embedding size of OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo to be about 4096. Lastly, we discuss ways that LLM providers can guard against these attacks, as well as how these capabilities can be viewed as a feature (rather than a bug) by allowing for greater transparency and accountability.</description>

      <title>AIOS: LLM Agent Operating System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-based intelligent agents face significant deployment challenges, particularly related to resource management. Allowing unrestricted access to LLM or tool resources can lead to inefficient or even potentially harmful resource allocation and utilization for agents. Furthermore, the absence of proper scheduling and resource management mechanisms in current agent designs hinders concurrent processing and limits overall system efficiency. As the diversity and complexity of agents continue to grow, addressing these resource management issues becomes increasingly critical to LLM-based agent systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the architecture of AIOS (LLM-based AI Agent Operating System) under the context of managing LLM-based agents. It introduces a novel architecture for serving LLM-based agents by isolating resources and LLM-specific services from agent applications into an AIOS kernel. This AIOS kernel provides fundamental services (e.g., scheduling, context management, memory management, storage management, access control) and efficient management of resources (e.g., LLM and external tools) for runtime agents. To enhance usability, AIOS also includes an AIOS-Agent SDK, a comprehensive suite of APIs designed for utilizing functionalities provided by the AIOS kernel. Experimental results demonstrate that using AIOS can achieve up to 2.1x faster execution for serving agents built by various agent frameworks.

      <title>Logic Query of Thoughts: Guiding Large Language Models to Answer Complex Logic Queries with Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04264v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the superb performance in many tasks, large language models (LLMs) bear the risk of generating hallucination or even wrong answers when confronted with tasks that demand the accuracy of knowledge. The issue becomes even more noticeable when addressing logic queries that require multiple logic reasoning steps. On the other hand, knowledge graph (KG) based question answering methods are capable of accurately identifying the correct answers with the help of knowledge graph, yet its accuracy could quickly deteriorate when the knowledge graph itself is sparse and incomplete. It remains a critical challenge on how to integrate knowledge graph reasoning with LLMs in a mutually beneficial way so as to mitigate both the hallucination problem of LLMs as well as the incompleteness issue of knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose 'Logic-Query-of-Thoughts' (LGOT) which is the first of its kind to combine LLMs with knowledge graph based logic query reasoning. LGOT seamlessly combines knowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, effectively breaking down complex logic queries into easy to answer subquestions. Through the utilization of both knowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, it successfully derives answers for each subquestion. By aggregating these results and selecting the highest quality candidate answers for each step, LGOT achieves accurate results to complex questions. Our experimental findings demonstrate substantial performance enhancements, with up to 20% improvement over ChatGPT.</description>

      <title>Is ChatGPT Transforming Academics' Writing Style?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on one million arXiv papers submitted from May 2018 to January 2024, we assess the textual density of ChatGPT's writing style in their abstracts through a statistical analysis of word frequency changes. Our model is calibrated and validated on a mixture of real abstracts and ChatGPT-modified abstracts (simulated data) after a careful noise analysis. The words used for estimation are not fixed but adaptive, including those with decreasing frequency. We find that large language models (LLMs), represented by ChatGPT, are having an increasing impact on arXiv abstracts, especially in the field of computer science, where the fraction of LLM-style abstracts is estimated to be approximately 35%, if we take the responses of GPT-3.5 to one simple prompt, "revise the following sentences", as a baseline. We conclude with an analysis of both positive and negative aspects of the penetration of LLMs into academics' writing style.</description>

      <title>Closing the Gap: Achieving Global Convergence (Last Iterate) of Actor-Critic under Markovian Sampling with Neural Network Parametrization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01843v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current state-of-the-art theoretical analysis of Actor-Critic (AC) algorithms significantly lags in addressing the practical aspects of AC implementations. This crucial gap needs bridging to bring the analysis in line with practical implementations of AC. To address this, we advocate for considering the MMCLG criteria: \textbf{M}ulti-layer neural network parametrization for actor/critic, \textbf{M}arkovian sampling, \textbf{C}ontinuous state-action spaces, the performance of the \textbf{L}ast iterate, and \textbf{G}lobal optimality. These aspects are practically significant and have been largely overlooked in existing theoretical analyses of AC algorithms. In this work, we address these gaps by providing the first comprehensive theoretical analysis of AC algorithms that encompasses all five crucial practical aspects (covers MMCLG criteria). We establish global convergence sample complexity bounds of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left({\epsilon^{-3}}\right)$. We achieve this result through our novel use of the weak gradient domination property of MDP's and our unique analysis of the error in critic estimation.</description>

      <title>CodeGRAG: Bridging the Gap between Natural Language and Programming Language via Graphical Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing large language models to generate codes has shown promising meaning in software development revolution. Despite the intelligence shown by the general large language models, their specificity in code generation can still be improved due to the syntactic gap and mismatched vocabulary existing among natural language and different programming languages. In this paper, we propose CodeGRAG, a Graphical Retrieval Augmented Code Generation framework to enhance the performance of LLMs. CodeGRAG builds the graphical view of code blocks based on the control flow and data flow of them to fill the gap between programming languages and natural language, which can facilitate natural language based LLMs for better understanding of code syntax and serve as a bridge among different programming languages. To take the extracted structural knowledge into the foundation models, we propose 1) a hard meta-graph prompt template to transform the challenging graphical representation into informative knowledge for tuning-free models and 2) a soft prompting technique that injects the domain knowledge of programming languages into the model parameters via finetuning the models with the help of a pretrained GNN expert model. Various experiments and ablations are done on four datasets including both the C++ and python languages to validate the hard meta-graph prompt, the soft prompting technique, and the effectiveness of the objectives for pretrained GNN expert. CodeGRAG improves the code generation ability of LLMs and can even offer performance gain for cross-lingual code generation.

      <title>TALC: Time-Aligned Captions for Multi-Scene Text-to-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04682v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most of these text-to-video (T2V) generative models often produce single-scene video clips that depict an entity performing a particular action (e.g., 'a red panda climbing a tree'). However, it is pertinent to generate multi-scene videos since they are ubiquitous in the real-world (e.g., 'a red panda climbing a tree' followed by 'the red panda sleeps on the top of the tree'). To generate multi-scene videos from the pretrained T2V model, we introduce a simple and effective Time-Aligned Captions (TALC) framework. Specifically, we enhance the text-conditioning mechanism in the T2V architecture to recognize the temporal alignment between the video scenes and scene descriptions. For instance, we condition the visual features of the earlier and later scenes of the generated video with the representations of the first scene description (e.g., 'a red panda climbing a tree') and second scene description (e.g., 'the red panda sleeps on the top of the tree'), respectively. As a result, we show that the T2V model can generate multi-scene videos that adhere to the multi-scene text descriptions and be visually consistent (e.g., entity and background). Further, we finetune the pretrained T2V model with multi-scene video-text data using the TALC framework. We show that the TALC-finetuned model outperforms the baseline by achieving a relative gain of 29% in the overall score, which averages visual consistency and text adherence using human evaluation.</description>

      <title>When AI Eats Itself: On the Caveats of AI Autophagy</title>

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies and large models are producing realistic outputs across various domains, such as images, text, speech, and music. Creating these advanced generative models requires significant resources, particularly large and high-quality datasets. To minimise training expenses, many algorithm developers use data created by the models themselves as a cost-effective training solution. However, not all synthetic data effectively improve model performance, necessitating a strategic balance in the use of real versus synthetic data to optimise outcomes. Currently, the previously well-controlled integration of real and synthetic data is becoming uncontrollable. The widespread and unregulated dissemination of synthetic data online leads to the contamination of datasets traditionally compiled through web scraping, now mixed with unlabeled synthetic data. This trend, known as the AI autophagy phenomenon, suggests a future where generative AI systems may increasingly consume their own outputs without discernment, raising concerns about model performance, reliability, and ethical implications. What will happen if generative AI continuously consumes itself without discernment? What measures can we take to mitigate the potential adverse effects? To address these research questions, this study examines the existing literature, delving into the consequences of AI autophagy, analyzing the associated risks, and exploring strategies to mitigate its impact. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive perspective on this phenomenon advocating for a balanced approach that promotes the sustainable development of generative AI technologies in the era of large models.</description>

      <title>Consistency of Neural Causal Partial Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in Neural Causal Models (NCMs) showcased how identification and partial identification of causal effects can be automatically carried out via training of neural generative models that respect the constraints encoded in a given causal graph [Xia et al. 2022, Balazadeh et al. 2022]. However, formal consistency of these methods has only been proven for the case of discrete variables or only for linear causal models. In this work, we prove the consistency of partial identification via NCMs in a general setting with both continuous and categorical variables. Further, our results highlight the impact of the design of the underlying neural network architecture in terms of depth and connectivity as well as the importance of applying Lipschitz regularization in the training phase. In particular, we provide a counterexample showing that without Lipschitz regularization this method may not be asymptotically consistent. Our results are enabled by new results on the approximability of Structural Causal Models (SCMs) via neural generative models, together with an analysis of the sample complexity of the resulting architectures and how that translates into an error in the constrained optimization problem that defines the partial identification bounds.</description>

      <title>Exploring the LLM Journey from Cognition to Expression with Linear Representations</title>

Abstract: This paper presents an in-depth examination of the evolution and interplay of cognitive and expressive capabilities in large language models (LLMs), with a specific focus on Baichuan-7B and Baichuan-33B, an advanced bilingual (Chinese and English) LLM series. We define and explore the model's cognitive and expressive capabilities through linear representations across three critical phases: Pretraining, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Cognitive capability is defined as the quantity and quality of information conveyed by the neuron output vectors within the network, similar to the neural signal processing in human cognition. Expressive capability is defined as the model's capability to produce word-level output. Our findings unveil a sequential development pattern, where cognitive abilities are largely established during Pretraining, whereas expressive abilities predominantly advance during SFT and RLHF. Statistical analyses confirm a significant correlation between the two capabilities, suggesting that cognitive capacity may limit expressive potential. The paper also explores the theoretical underpinnings of these divergent developmental trajectories and their connection to the LLMs' architectural design. Moreover, we evaluate various optimization-independent strategies, such as few-shot learning and repeated sampling, which bridge the gap between cognitive and expressive capabilities. This research reveals the potential connection between the hidden space and the output space, contributing valuable insights into the interpretability and controllability of their training processes.</description>

      <title>Video-Language Critic: Transferable Reward Functions for Language-Conditioned Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural language is often the easiest and most convenient modality for humans to specify tasks for robots. However, learning to ground language to behavior typically requires impractical amounts of diverse, language-annotated demonstrations collected on each target robot. In this work, we aim to separate the problem of what to accomplish from how to accomplish it, as the former can benefit from substantial amounts of external observation-only data, and only the latter depends on a specific robot embodiment. To this end, we propose Video-Language Critic, a reward model that can be trained on readily available cross-embodiment data using contrastive learning and a temporal ranking objective, and use it to score behavior traces from a separate actor. When trained on Open X-Embodiment data, our reward model enables 2x more sample-efficient policy training on Meta-World tasks than a sparse reward only, despite a significant domain gap. Using in-domain data but in a challenging task generalization setting on Meta-World, we further demonstrate more sample-efficient training than is possible with prior language-conditioned reward models that are either trained with binary classification, use static images, or do not leverage the temporal information present in video data.</description>

      <title>HPE-CogVLM: Advancing Vision Language Models with a Head Pose Grounding Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Head pose estimation (HPE) requires a sophisticated understanding of 3D spatial relationships to generate precise yaw, pitch, and roll angles. Previous HPE models, primarily CNN-based, rely on cropped close-up human head images as inputs and often lack robustness in real-world scenario. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can analyze entire images while focusing on specific objects through their attention mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to improve the HPE accuracy by leveraging the object detection grounding capability of a VLM, referred to as CogVLM. We empirically find that directly LoRA fine-tuning of this VLM for the HPE task fails to achieve desirable HPE accuracy, while some model merging methods can improve accuracy but frequently produce blended invalid response formats, struggling to handle both object detection and HPE tasks simultaneously. To integrate HPE capability into CogVLM effectively, we develop a novel LoRA layer-based model merging method. This merging approach applies a high cosine similarity threshold and a winner-takes-all layer selection strategy, aligning attention to the HPE task while preserving original object detection knowledge. It successfully resolves issues with blended invalid response formats and improves accuracy. Results show that our HPE-CogVLM achieves a 31.5\% reduction in Mean Absolute Error over the current state-of-the-art CNN model, 6DRepNet, in cross-dataset evaluation. Furthermore, HPE-CogVLM outperforms both directly LoRA fine-tuned and task arithmetic-based merged VLMs across all HPE metrics.</description>

      <title>Preference Tuning For Toxicity Mitigation Generalizes Across Languages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detoxifying multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) has become crucial due to their increasing global use. In this work, we explore zero-shot cross-lingual generalization of preference tuning in detoxifying LLMs. Unlike previous studies that show limited cross-lingual generalization for other safety tasks, we demonstrate that Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training with only English data can significantly reduce toxicity in multilingual open-ended generations. For example, the probability of mGPT-1.3B generating toxic continuations drops from 46.8% to 3.9% across 17 different languages after training. Our results also extend to other multilingual LLMs, such as BLOOM, Llama3, and Aya-23. Using mechanistic interpretability tools like causal intervention and activation analysis, we identified the dual multilinguality property of MLP layers in LLMs, which explains the cross-lingual generalization of DPO. Finally, we show that bilingual sentence retrieval can predict the cross-lingual transferability of DPO preference tuning.</description>

      <title>Confidence Regulation Neurons in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their widespread use, the mechanisms by which large language models (LLMs) represent and regulate uncertainty in next-token predictions remain largely unexplored. This study investigates two critical components believed to influence this uncertainty: the recently discovered entropy neurons and a new set of components that we term token frequency neurons. Entropy neurons are characterized by an unusually high weight norm and influence the final layer normalization (LayerNorm) scale to effectively scale down the logits. Our work shows that entropy neurons operate by writing onto an unembedding null space, allowing them to impact the residual stream norm with minimal direct effect on the logits themselves. We observe the presence of entropy neurons across a range of models, up to 7 billion parameters. On the other hand, token frequency neurons, which we discover and describe here for the first time, boost or suppress each token's logit proportionally to its log frequency, thereby shifting the output distribution towards or away from the unigram distribution. Finally, we present a detailed case study where entropy neurons actively manage confidence in the setting of induction, i.e. detecting and continuing repeated subsequences.</description>

      <title>Attack-Aware Noise Calibration for Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a widely used approach for mitigating privacy risks when training machine learning models on sensitive data. DP mechanisms add noise during training to limit the risk of information leakage. The scale of the added noise is critical, as it determines the trade-off between privacy and utility. The standard practice is to select the noise scale to satisfy a given privacy budget $\varepsilon$. This privacy budget is in turn interpreted in terms of operational attack risks, such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of inference attacks aimed to recover information about the training data records. We show that first calibrating the noise scale to a privacy budget $\varepsilon$, and then translating {\epsilon} to attack risk leads to overly conservative risk assessments and unnecessarily low utility. Instead, we propose methods to directly calibrate the noise scale to a desired attack risk level, bypassing the step of choosing $\varepsilon$. For a given notion of attack risk, our approach significantly decreases noise scale, leading to increased utility at the same level of privacy. We empirically demonstrate that calibrating noise to attack sensitivity/specificity, rather than $\varepsilon$, when training privacy-preserving ML models substantially improves model accuracy for the same risk level. Our work provides a principled and practical way to improve the utility of privacy-preserving ML without compromising on privacy.

      <title>TCKAN:A Novel Integrated Network Model for Predicting Mortality Risk in Sepsis Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sepsis poses a major global health threat, accounting for millions of deaths annually and significant economic costs. Accurately predicting the risk of mortality in sepsis patients enables early identification, promotes the efficient allocation of medical resources, and facilitates timely interventions, thereby improving patient outcomes. Current methods typically utilize only one type of data--either constant, temporal, or ICD codes. This study introduces a novel approach, the Time-Constant Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TCKAN), which uniquely integrates temporal data, constant data, and ICD codes within a single predictive model. Unlike existing methods that typically rely on one type of data, TCKAN leverages a multi-modal data integration strategy, resulting in superior predictive accuracy and robustness in identifying high-risk sepsis patients. Validated against the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets, TCKAN surpasses existing machine learning and deep learning methods in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Notably, TCKAN achieved AUCs of 87.76% and 88.07%, demonstrating superior capability in identifying high-risk patients. Additionally, TCKAN effectively combats the prevalent issue of data imbalance in clinical settings, improving the detection of patients at elevated risk of mortality and facilitating timely interventions. These results confirm the model's effectiveness and its potential to transform patient management and treatment optimization in clinical practice. Although the TCKAN model has already incorporated temporal, constant, and ICD code data, future research could include more diverse medical data types, such as imaging and laboratory test results, to achieve a more comprehensive data integration and further improve predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>StoX-Net: Stochastic Processing of Partial Sums for Efficient In-Memory Computing DNN Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crossbar-based in-memory computing (IMC) has emerged as a promising platform for hardware acceleration of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the energy and latency of IMC systems are dominated by the large overhead of the peripheral analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). To address such ADC bottleneck, here we propose to implement stochastic processing of array-level partial sums (PS) for efficient IMC. Leveraging the probabilistic switching of spin-orbit torque magnetic tunnel junctions, the proposed PS processing eliminates the costly ADC, achieving significant improvement in energy and area efficiency. To mitigate accuracy loss, we develop PS-quantization-aware training that enables backward propagation across stochastic PS. Furthermore, a novel scheme with an inhomogeneous sampling length of the stochastic conversion is proposed. When running ResNet20 on the CIFAR-10 dataset, our architecture-to-algorithm co-design demonstrates up to 16x, 8x, and 10x improvement in energy, latency, and area, respectively, compared to IMC with standard ADC. Our optimized design configuration using stochastic PS achieved 130x (24x) improvement in Energy-Delay-Product compared to IMC with full precision ADC (sparse low-bit ADC), while maintaining near-software accuracy at various benchmark classification tasks.</description>

      <title>xAI-Drop: Don't Use What You Cannot Explain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the predominant paradigm for learning from graph-structured data, offering a wide range of applications from social network analysis to bioinformatics. Despite their versatility, GNNs face challenges such as lack of generalization and poor interpretability, which hinder their wider adoption and reliability in critical applications. Dropping has emerged as an effective paradigm for improving the generalization capabilities of GNNs. However, existing approaches often rely on random or heuristic-based selection criteria, lacking a principled method to identify and exclude nodes that contribute to noise and over-complexity in the model. In this work, we argue that explainability should be a key indicator of a model's quality throughout its training phase. To this end, we introduce xAI-Drop, a novel topological-level dropping regularizer that leverages explainability to pinpoint noisy network elements to be excluded from the GNN propagation mechanism. An empirical evaluation on diverse real-world datasets demonstrates that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art dropping approaches in accuracy, and improves explanation quality.</description>

      <title>Trusting Your AI Agent Emotionally and Cognitively: Development and Validation of a Semantic Differential Scale for AI Trust</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trust is not just a cognitive issue but also an emotional one, yet the research in human-AI interactions has primarily focused on the cognitive route of trust development. Recent work has highlighted the importance of studying affective trust towards AI, especially in the context of emerging human-like LLMs-powered conversational agents. However, there is a lack of validated and generalizable measures for the two-dimensional construct of trust in AI agents. To address this gap, we developed and validated a set of 27-item semantic differential scales for affective and cognitive trust through a scenario-based survey study. We then further validated and applied the scale through an experiment study. Our empirical findings showed how the emotional and cognitive aspects of trust interact with each other and collectively shape a person's overall trust in AI agents. Our study methodology and findings also provide insights into the capability of the state-of-art LLMs to foster trust through different routes.</description>

      <title>Eigen Attention: Attention in Low-Rank Space for KV Cache Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in the domain of natural language processing due to their impressive reasoning abilities. Recently, there has been considerable interest in increasing the context lengths for these models to enhance their applicability to complex tasks. However, at long context lengths and large batch sizes, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores the attention keys and values, emerges as the new bottleneck in memory usage during inference. To address this, we propose Eigen Attention, which performs the attention operation in a low-rank space, thereby reducing the KV cache memory overhead. Our proposed approach is orthogonal to existing KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with them. Through extensive experiments over OPT, MPT, and Llama model families, we demonstrate that Eigen Attention results in up to 40% reduction in KV cache sizes and up to 60% reduction in attention operation latency with minimal drop in performance.

      <title>How to Connect Speech Foundation Models and Large Language Models? What Matters and What Does Not</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable performance achieved by Large Language Models (LLM) has driven research efforts to leverage them for a wide range of tasks and input modalities. In speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, the emerging solution consists of projecting the output of the encoder of a Speech Foundational Model (SFM) into the LLM embedding space through an adapter module. However, no work has yet investigated how much the downstream-task performance depends on each component (SFM, adapter, LLM) nor whether the best design of the adapter depends on the chosen SFM and LLM. To fill this gap, we evaluate the combination of 5 adapter modules, 2 LLMs (Mistral and Llama), and 2 SFMs (Whisper and SeamlessM4T) on two widespread S2T tasks, namely Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Translation. Our results demonstrate that the SFM plays a pivotal role in downstream performance, while the adapter choice has moderate impact and depends on the SFM and LLM.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Wavelet Transformations for Generalizable Deepfake Forgery Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of digital image manipulation, particularly with the advancement of deep generative models, significantly challenges existing deepfake detection methods, especially when the origin of the deepfake is obscure. To tackle the increasing complexity of these forgeries, we propose \textbf{Wavelet-CLIP}, a deepfake detection framework that integrates wavelet transforms with features derived from the ViT-L/14 architecture, pre-trained in the CLIP fashion. Wavelet-CLIP utilizes Wavelet Transforms to deeply analyze both spatial and frequency features from images, thus enhancing the model's capability to detect sophisticated deepfakes. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted extensive evaluations against existing state-of-the-art methods for cross-dataset generalization and detection of unseen images generated by standard diffusion models. Our method showcases outstanding performance, achieving an average AUC of 0.749 for cross-data generalization and 0.893 for robustness against unseen deepfakes, outperforming all compared methods.

      <title>Contextual Document Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02525v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dense document embeddings are central to neural retrieval. The dominant paradigm is to train and construct embeddings by running encoders directly on individual documents. In this work, we argue that these embeddings, while effective, are implicitly out-of-context for targeted use cases of retrieval, and that a contextualized document embedding should take into account both the document and neighboring documents in context - analogous to contextualized word embeddings. We propose two complementary methods for contextualized document embeddings: first, an alternative contrastive learning objective that explicitly incorporates the document neighbors into the intra-batch contextual loss; second, a new contextual architecture that explicitly encodes neighbor document information into the encoded representation. Results show that both methods achieve better performance than biencoders in several settings, with differences especially pronounced out-of-domain. We achieve state-of-the-art results on the MTEB benchmark with no hard negative mining, score distillation, dataset-specific instructions, intra-GPU example-sharing, or extremely large batch sizes. Our method can be applied to improve performance on any contrastive learning dataset and any biencoder.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Robot Navigation Policies with Task-Specific Uncertainty Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robots performing navigation tasks in complex environments face significant challenges due to uncertainty in state estimation. Effectively managing this uncertainty is crucial, but the optimal approach varies depending on the specific details of the task: different tasks require varying levels of precision in different regions of the environment. For instance, a robot navigating a crowded space might need precise localization near obstacles but can operate effectively with less precise state estimates in open areas. This varying need for certainty in different parts of the environment, depending on the task, calls for policies that can adapt their uncertainty management strategies based on task-specific requirements. In this paper, we present a framework for integrating task-specific uncertainty requirements directly into navigation policies. We introduce Task-Specific Uncertainty Map (TSUM), which represents acceptable levels of state estimation uncertainty across different regions of the operating environment for a given task. Using TSUM, we propose Generalized Uncertainty Integration for Decision-Making and Execution (GUIDE), a policy conditioning framework that incorporates these uncertainty requirements into the robot's decision-making process. We find that conditioning policies on TSUMs provides an effective way to express task-specific uncertainty requirements and enables the robot to reason about the context-dependent value of certainty. We show how integrating GUIDE into reinforcement learning frameworks allows the agent to learn navigation policies without the need for explicit reward engineering to balance task completion and uncertainty management. We evaluate GUIDE on a variety of real-world navigation tasks and find that it demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates compared to baselines.

      <title>RRADistill: Distilling LLMs' Passage Ranking Ability for Document Re-Ranking of Long-Tail Queries in a Search Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding the semantic relationships between queries and documents, even with lengthy and complex long-tail queries. These queries are challenging for feedback-based rankings due to sparse user engagement and limited feedback, making LLMs' ranking ability highly valuable. However, the large size and slow inference of LLMs necessitate the development of smaller, more efficient models (sLLMs). Recently, integrating ranking label generation into distillation techniques has become crucial, but existing methods underutilize LLMs' capabilities and are cumbersome. Our research, RRADistill: Re-Ranking Ability Distillation, propose an efficient label generation pipeline and novel sLLM training methods for both encoder and decoder models. We introduce an encoder-based method using a Term Control Layer to capture term matching signals and a decoder-based model with a ranking layer for enhanced understanding. A/B testing on a Korean-based search platform, validates the effectiveness of our approach in improving re-ranking for long-tail queries.</description>

      <title>Multiple Global Peaks Big Bang-Big Crunch Algorithm for Multimodal Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main challenge of multimodal optimization problems is identifying multiple peaks with high accuracy in multidimensional search spaces with irregular landscapes. This work proposes the Multiple Global Peaks Big Bang-Big Crunch (MGP-BBBC) algorithm, which addresses the challenge of multimodal optimization problems by introducing a specialized mechanism for each operator. The algorithm expands the Big Bang-Big Crunch algorithm, a state-of-the-art metaheuristic inspired by the universe's evolution. Specifically, MGP-BBBC groups the best individuals of the population into cluster-based centers of mass and then expands them with a progressively lower disturbance to guarantee convergence. During this process, it (i) applies a distance-based filtering to remove unnecessary elites such that the ones on smaller peaks are not lost, (ii) promotes isolated individuals based on their niche count after clustering, and (iii) balances exploration and exploitation during offspring generation to target specific accuracy levels. Experimental results on twenty multimodal benchmark test functions show that MGP-BBBC generally performs better or competitively with respect to other state-of-the-art multimodal optimizers.</description>

      <title>Embedding with Large Language Models for Classification of HIPAA Safeguard Compliance Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although software developers of mHealth apps are responsible for protecting patient data and adhering to strict privacy and security requirements, many of them lack awareness of HIPAA regulations and struggle to distinguish between HIPAA rules categories. Therefore, providing guidance of HIPAA rules patterns classification is essential for developing secured applications for Google Play Store. In this work, we identified the limitations of traditional Word2Vec embeddings in processing code patterns. To address this, we adopt multilingual BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) which offers contextualized embeddings to the attributes of dataset to overcome the issues. Therefore, we applied this BERT to our dataset for embedding code patterns and then uses these embedded code to various machine learning approaches. Our results demonstrate that the models significantly enhances classification performance, with Logistic Regression achieving a remarkable accuracy of 99.95\%. Additionally, we obtained high accuracy from Support Vector Machine (99.79\%), Random Forest (99.73\%), and Naive Bayes (95.93\%), outperforming existing approaches. This work underscores the effectiveness and showcases its potential for secure application development.</description>

      <title>Mind Your Step (by Step): Chain-of-Thought can Reduce Performance on Tasks where Thinking Makes Humans Worse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has become a widely used strategy for working with large language and multimodal models. While CoT has been shown to improve performance across many tasks, determining the settings in which it is effective remains an ongoing effort. In particular, it is still an open question in what settings CoT systematically reduces model performance. In this paper, we seek to identify the characteristics of tasks where CoT reduces performance by drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, looking at cases where (i) verbal thinking or deliberation hurts performance in humans, and (ii) the constraints governing human performance generalize to language models. Three such cases are implicit statistical learning, visual recognition, and classifying with patterns containing exceptions. In extensive experiments across all three settings, we find that a diverse collection of state-of-the-art models exhibit significant drop-offs in performance (e.g., up to 36.3% absolute accuracy for OpenAI o1-preview compared to GPT-4o) when using inference-time reasoning compared to zero-shot counterparts. We also identify three tasks that satisfy condition (i) but not (ii), and find that while verbal thinking reduces human performance in these tasks, CoT retains or increases model performance. Overall, our results show that while there is not an exact parallel between the cognitive processes of models and those of humans, considering cases where thinking has negative consequences for human performance can help us identify settings where it negatively impacts models. By connecting the literature on human deliberation with evaluations of CoT, we offer a new tool that can be used in understanding the impact of prompt choices and inference-time reasoning.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs): Improved Prompt Injection Attacks Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming a popular tool as they have significantly advanced in their capability to tackle a wide range of language-based tasks. However, LLMs applications are highly vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, which poses a critical problem. These attacks target LLMs applications through using carefully designed input prompts to divert the model from adhering to original instruction, thereby it could execute unintended actions. These manipulations pose serious security threats which potentially results in data leaks, biased outputs, or harmful responses. This project explores the security vulnerabilities in relation to prompt injection attacks. To detect whether a prompt is vulnerable or not, we follows two approaches: 1) a pre-trained LLM, and 2) a fine-tuned LLM. Then, we conduct a thorough analysis and comparison of the classification performance. Firstly, we use pre-trained XLM-RoBERTa model to detect prompt injections using test dataset without any fine-tuning and evaluate it by zero-shot classification. Then, this proposed work will apply supervised fine-tuning to this pre-trained LLM using a task-specific labeled dataset from deepset in huggingface, and this fine-tuned model achieves impressive results with 99.13\% accuracy, 100\% precision, 98.33\% recall and 99.15\% F1-score thorough rigorous experimentation and evaluation. We observe that our approach is highly efficient in detecting prompt injection attacks.</description>

      <title>FinTeamExperts: Role Specialized MOEs For Financial Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Phi3 and Llama-3, are leading a significant leap in AI, as they can generalize knowledge from their training to new tasks without fine-tuning. However, their application in the financial domain remains relatively limited. The financial field is inherently complex, requiring a deep understanding across various perspectives, from macro, micro economic trend to quantitative analysis. Motivated by this complexity, a mixture of expert LLMs tailored to specific financial domains could offer a more comprehensive understanding for intricate financial tasks. In this paper, we present the FinTeamExperts, a role-specialized LLM framework structured as a Mixture of Experts (MOEs) for financial analysis. The framework simulates a collaborative team setting by training each model to specialize in distinct roles: Macro Analysts, Micro analysts, and Quantitative Analysts. This role-specific specialization enhances the model's ability to integrate their domain-specific expertise. We achieve this by training three 8-billion parameter models on different corpus, each dedicated to excelling in specific finance-related roles. We then instruct-tune FinTeamExperts on downstream tasks to align with practical financial tasks. The experimental results show that FinTeamExperts outperform all models of the same size and larger on three out of four datasets. On the fourth dataset, which presents a more complex task, FinTeamExperts still surpass all models of the same size. This highlights the success of our role-based specialization approach and the continued training approach for FinTeamExperts.</description>

      <title>FALCON: Feedback-driven Adaptive Long/short-term memory reinforced Coding Optimization system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in automated code generation. Despite their strong instruction-following capabilities, these models frequently struggled to align with user intent in coding scenarios. In particular, they were hampered by datasets that lacked diversity and failed to address specialized tasks or edge cases. Furthermore, challenges in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) led to failures in generating precise, human-intent-aligned code. To tackle these challenges and improve the code generation performance for automated programming systems, we propose Feedback-driven Adaptive Long/short-term memory reinforced Coding Optimization (i.e., FALCON). FALCON is structured into two hierarchical levels. From the global level, long-term memory improves code quality by retaining and applying learned knowledge. At the local level, short-term memory allows for the incorporation of immediate feedback from compilers and AI systems. Additionally, we introduce meta-reinforcement learning with feedback rewards to solve the global-local bi-level optimization problem and enhance the model's adaptability across diverse code generation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our technique achieves state-of-the-art performance, leading other reinforcement learning methods by more than 4.5 percentage points on the MBPP benchmark and 6.1 percentage points on the Humaneval benchmark. The open-sourced code is publicly available at https://github.com/titurte/FALCON.</description>

      <title>GEPS: Boosting Generalization in Parametric PDE Neural Solvers through Adaptive Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) presents significant challenges for data-driven methods due to the sensitivity of spatio-temporal dynamics to variations in PDE parameters. Machine learning approaches often struggle to capture this variability. To address this, data-driven approaches learn parametric PDEs by sampling a very large variety of trajectories with varying PDE parameters. We first show that incorporating conditioning mechanisms for learning parametric PDEs is essential and that among them, $\textit{adaptive conditioning}$, allows stronger generalization. As existing adaptive conditioning methods do not scale well with respect to the number of parameters to adapt in the neural solver, we propose GEPS, a simple adaptation mechanism to boost GEneralization in Pde Solvers via a first-order optimization and low-rank rapid adaptation of a small set of context parameters. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach for both fully data-driven and for physics-aware neural solvers. Validation performed on a whole range of spatio-temporal forecasting problems demonstrates excellent performance for generalizing to unseen conditions including initial conditions, PDE coefficients, forcing terms and solution domain. $\textit{Project page}$: https://geps-project.github.io</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Predicts Mammographic Breast Density in Clinical Breast Ultrasound Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Breast density, as derived from mammographic images and defined by the American College of Radiology's Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer. Breast ultrasound (BUS) is an alternative breast cancer screening modality, particularly useful for early detection in low-resource, rural contexts. The purpose of this study was to explore an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict BI-RADS mammographic breast density category from clinical, handheld BUS imaging. Methods: All data are sourced from the Hawaii and Pacific Islands Mammography Registry. We compared deep learning methods from BUS imaging, as well as machine learning models from image statistics alone. The use of AI-derived BUS density as a risk factor for breast cancer was then compared to clinical BI-RADS breast density while adjusting for age. The BUS data were split by individual into 70/20/10% groups for training, validation, and testing. Results: 405,120 clinical BUS images from 14.066 women were selected for inclusion in this study, resulting in 9.846 women for training (302,574 images), 2,813 for validation (11,223 images), and 1,406 for testing (4,042 images). On the held-out testing set, the strongest AI model achieves AUROC 0.854 predicting BI-RADS mammographic breast density from BUS imaging and outperforms all shallow machine learning methods based on image statistics. In cancer risk prediction, age-adjusted AI BUS breast density predicted 5-year breast cancer risk with 0.633 AUROC, as compared to 0.637 AUROC from age-adjusted clinical breast density. Conclusions: BI-RADS mammographic breast density can be estimated from BUS imaging with high accuracy using a deep learning model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AI-derived BUS breast density is predictive of 5-year breast cancer risk in our population.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Osteoporosis is a common condition that increases fracture risk, especially in older adults. Early diagnosis is vital for preventing fractures, reducing treatment costs, and preserving mobility. However, healthcare providers face challenges like limited labeled data and difficulties in processing medical images. This study presents a novel multi-modal learning framework that integrates clinical and imaging data to improve diagnostic accuracy and model interpretability. The model utilizes three pre-trained networks-VGG19, InceptionV3, and ResNet50-to extract deep features from X-ray images. These features are transformed using PCA to reduce dimensionality and focus on the most relevant components. A clustering-based selection process identifies the most representative components, which are then combined with preprocessed clinical data and processed through a fully connected network (FCN) for final classification. A feature importance plot highlights key variables, showing that Medical History, BMI, and Height were the main contributors, emphasizing the significance of patient-specific data. While imaging features were valuable, they had lower importance, indicating that clinical data are crucial for accurate predictions. This framework promotes precise and interpretable predictions, enhancing transparency and building trust in AI-driven diagnoses for clinical integration.</description>

Abstract: Quantum resistance is vital for emerging cryptographic systems as quantum technologies continue to advance towards large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers. Resistance may be offered by quantum key distribution (QKD), which provides information-theoretic security using quantum states of photons, but may be limited by transmission loss at long distances. An alternative approach uses classical means and is conjectured to be resistant to quantum attacks, so-called post-quantum cryptography (PQC), but it is yet to be rigorously proven, and its current implementations are computationally expensive. To overcome the security and performance challenges present in each, here we develop hybrid protocols by which QKD and PQC inter-operate within a joint quantum-classical network. In particular, we consider different hybrid designs that may offer enhanced speed and/or security over the individual performance of either approach. Furthermore, we present a method for analyzing the security of hybrid protocols in key distribution networks. Our hybrid approach paves the way for joint quantum-classical communication networks, which leverage the advantages of both QKD and PQC and can be tailored to the requirements of various practical networks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Sparse Allocation with Mutual Choice &amp; Feature Choice Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a promising approach to extracting features from neural networks, enabling model interpretability as well as causal interventions on model internals. SAEs generate sparse feature representations using a sparsifying activation function that implicitly defines a set of token-feature matches. We frame the token-feature matching as a resource allocation problem constrained by a total sparsity upper bound. For example, TopK SAEs solve this allocation problem with the additional constraint that each token matches with at most $k$ features. In TopK SAEs, the $k$ active features per token constraint is the same across tokens, despite some tokens being more difficult to reconstruct than others. To address this limitation, we propose two novel SAE variants, Feature Choice SAEs and Mutual Choice SAEs, which each allow for a variable number of active features per token. Feature Choice SAEs solve the sparsity allocation problem under the additional constraint that each feature matches with at most $m$ tokens. Mutual Choice SAEs solve the unrestricted allocation problem where the total sparsity budget can be allocated freely between tokens and features. Additionally, we introduce a new auxiliary loss function, $\mathtt{aux\_zipf\_loss}$, which generalises the $\mathtt{aux\_k\_loss}$ to mitigate dead and underutilised features. Our methods result in SAEs with fewer dead features and improved reconstruction loss at equivalent sparsity levels as a result of the inherent adaptive computation. More accurate and scalable feature extraction methods provide a path towards better understanding and more precise control of foundation models.</description>

      <title>GraphXAIN: Narratives to Explain Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a powerful technique for machine learning on graph-structured data, yet they pose interpretability challenges, especially for non-expert users. Existing GNN explanation methods often yield technical outputs such as subgraphs and feature importance scores, which are not easily understood. Building on recent insights from social science and other Explainable AI (XAI) methods, we propose GraphXAIN, a natural language narrative that explains individual predictions made by GNNs. We present a model-agnostic and explainer-agnostic XAI approach that complements graph explainers by generating GraphXAINs, using Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrating graph data, individual predictions from GNNs, explanatory subgraphs, and feature importances. We define XAI Narratives and XAI Descriptions, highlighting their distinctions and emphasizing the importance of narrative principles in effective explanations. By incorporating natural language narratives, our approach supports graph practitioners and non-expert users, aligning with social science research on explainability and enhancing user understanding and trust in complex GNN models. We demonstrate GraphXAIN's capabilities on a real-world graph dataset, illustrating how its generated narratives can aid understanding compared to traditional graph explainer outputs or other descriptive explanation methods.</description>

      <title>Region-Guided Attack on the Segment Anything Model (SAM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a cornerstone of image segmentation, demonstrating exceptional performance across various applications, particularly in autonomous driving and medical imaging, where precise segmentation is crucial. However, SAM is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can significantly impair its functionality through minor input perturbations. Traditional techniques, such as FGSM and PGD, are often ineffective in segmentation tasks due to their reliance on global perturbations that overlook spatial nuances. Recent methods like Attack-SAM-K and UAD have begun to address these challenges, but they frequently depend on external cues and do not fully leverage the structural interdependencies within segmentation processes. This limitation underscores the need for a novel adversarial strategy that exploits the unique characteristics of segmentation tasks. In response, we introduce the Region-Guided Attack (RGA), designed specifically for SAM. RGA utilizes a Region-Guided Map (RGM) to manipulate segmented regions, enabling targeted perturbations that fragment large segments and expand smaller ones, resulting in erroneous outputs from SAM. Our experiments demonstrate that RGA achieves high success rates in both white-box and black-box scenarios, emphasizing the need for robust defenses against such sophisticated attacks. RGA not only reveals SAM's vulnerabilities but also lays the groundwork for developing more resilient defenses against adversarial threats in image segmentation.</description>

      <title>log-RRIM: Yield Prediction via Local-to-global Reaction Representation Learning and Interaction Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of chemical reaction yields is crucial for optimizing organic synthesis, potentially reducing time and resources spent on experimentation. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), there is growing interest in leveraging AI-based methods to accelerate yield predictions without conducting in vitro experiments. We present log-RRIM, an innovative graph transformer-based framework designed for predicting chemical reaction yields. Our approach implements a unique local-to-global reaction representation learning strategy. This approach initially captures detailed molecule-level information and then models and aggregates intermolecular interactions, ensuring that the impact of varying-sizes molecular fragments on yield is accurately accounted for. Another key feature of log-RRIM is its integration of a cross-attention mechanism that focuses on the interplay between reagents and reaction centers. This design reflects a fundamental principle in chemical reactions: the crucial role of reagents in influencing bond-breaking and formation processes, which ultimately affect reaction yields. log-RRIM outperforms existing methods in our experiments, especially for medium to high-yielding reactions, proving its reliability as a predictor. Its advanced modeling of reactant-reagent interactions and sensitivity to small molecular fragments make it a valuable tool for reaction planning and optimization in chemical synthesis. The data and codes of log-RRIM are accessible through https://github.com/ninglab/Yield_log_RRIM.</description>

      <title>Neurons for Neutrons: A Transformer Model for Computation Load Estimation on Domain-Decomposed Neutron Transport Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain decomposition is a technique used to reduce memory overhead on large neutron transport problems. Currently, the optimal load-balanced processor allocation for these domains is typically determined through small-scale simulations of the problem, which can be time-consuming for researchers and must be repeated anytime a problem input is changed. We propose a Transformer model with a unique 3D input embedding, and input representations designed for domain-decomposed neutron transport problems, which can predict the subdomain computation loads generated by small-scale simulations. We demonstrate that such a model trained on domain-decomposed Small Modular Reactor (SMR) simulations achieves 98.2% accuracy while being able to skip the small-scale simulation step entirely. Tests of the model's robustness on variant fuel assemblies, other problem geometries, and changes in simulation parameters are also discussed.</description>

      <title>GS2Pose: Two-stage 6D Object Pose Estimation Guided by Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for accurate and robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects, named GS2Pose. By introducing 3D Gaussian splatting, GS2Pose can utilize the reconstruction results without requiring a high-quality CAD model, which means it only requires segmented RGBD images as input. Specifically, GS2Pose employs a two-stage structure consisting of coarse estimation followed by refined estimation. In the coarse stage, a lightweight U-Net network with a polarization attention mechanism, called Pose-Net, is designed. By using the 3DGS model for supervised training, Pose-Net can generate NOCS images to compute a coarse pose. In the refinement stage, GS2Pose formulates a pose regression algorithm following the idea of reprojection or Bundle Adjustment (BA), referred to as GS-Refiner. By leveraging Lie algebra to extend 3DGS, GS-Refiner obtains a pose-differentiable rendering pipeline that refines the coarse pose by comparing the input images with the rendered images. GS-Refiner also selectively updates parameters in the 3DGS model to achieve environmental adaptation, thereby enhancing the algorithm's robustness and flexibility to illuminative variation, occlusion, and other challenging disruptive factors. GS2Pose was evaluated through experiments conducted on the LineMod dataset, where it was compared with similar algorithms, yielding highly competitive results. The code for GS2Pose will soon be released on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistency Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-alignment, whereby models learn to improve themselves without human annotation, is a rapidly growing research area. However, existing techniques often fail to improve complex reasoning tasks due to the difficulty of assigning correct rewards. An orthogonal approach that is known to improve correctness is self-consistency, a method applied at inference time based on multiple sampling in order to find the most consistent answer. In this work, we extend the self-consistency concept to help train models. We thus introduce self-consistency preference optimization (ScPO), which iteratively trains consistent answers to be preferred over inconsistent ones on unsupervised new problems. We show ScPO leads to large improvements over conventional reward model training on reasoning tasks such as GSM8K and MATH, closing the gap with supervised training with gold answers or preferences, and that combining ScPO with standard supervised learning improves results even further. On ZebraLogic, ScPO finetunes Llama-3 8B to be superior to Llama-3 70B, Gemma-2 27B, and Claude-3 Haiku.</description>

      <title>ZAHA: Introducing the Level of Facade Generalization and the Large-Scale Point Cloud Facade Semantic Segmentation Benchmark Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Facade semantic segmentation is a long-standing challenge in photogrammetry and computer vision. Although the last decades have witnessed the influx of facade segmentation methods, there is a lack of comprehensive facade classes and data covering the architectural variability. In ZAHA, we introduce Level of Facade Generalization (LoFG), novel hierarchical facade classes designed based on international urban modeling standards, ensuring compatibility with real-world challenging classes and uniform methods' comparison. Realizing the LoFG, we present to date the largest semantic 3D facade segmentation dataset, providing 601 million annotated points at five and 15 classes of LoFG2 and LoFG3, respectively. Moreover, we analyze the performance of baseline semantic segmentation methods on our introduced LoFG classes and data, complementing it with a discussion on the unresolved challenges for facade segmentation. We firmly believe that ZAHA shall facilitate further development of 3D facade semantic segmentation methods, enabling robust segmentation indispensable in creating urban digital twins.</description>

      <title>GPTKB: Building Very Large Knowledge Bases from Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General-domain knowledge bases (KB), in particular the "big three" -- Wikidata, Yago and DBpedia -- are the backbone of many intelligent applications. While these three have seen steady development, comprehensive KB construction at large has seen few fresh attempts. In this work, we propose to build a large general-domain KB entirely from a large language model (LLM). We demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale KB construction from LLMs, while highlighting specific challenges arising around entity recognition, entity and property canonicalization, and taxonomy construction. As a prototype, we use GPT-4o-mini to construct GPTKB, which contains 105 million triples for more than 2.9 million entities, at a cost 100x less than previous KBC projects. Our work is a landmark for two fields: For NLP, for the first time, it provides \textit{constructive} insights into the knowledge (or beliefs) of LLMs. For the Semantic Web, it shows novel ways forward for the long-standing challenge of general-domain KB construction. GPTKB is accessible at http://gptkb.org.</description>
