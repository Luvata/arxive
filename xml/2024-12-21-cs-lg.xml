      <title>Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Channel Access in WLANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to address distributed channel access in wireless local area networks. In particular, we consider the challenging yet more practical case where the agents heterogeneously adopt value-based or policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms to train the model. We propose a heterogeneous MARL training framework, named QPMIX, which adopts a centralized training with distributed execution paradigm to enable heterogeneous agents to collaborate. Moreover, we theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed heterogeneous MARL method when using the linear value function approximation. Our method maximizes the network throughput and ensures fairness among stations, therefore, enhancing the overall network performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed QPMIX algorithm improves throughput, mean delay, delay jitter, and collision rates compared with conventional carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance in the saturated traffic scenario. Furthermore, the QPMIX is shown to be robust in unsaturated and delay-sensitive traffic scenarios, and promotes cooperation among heterogeneous agents.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Inference Optimization Techniques for Mixture of Experts Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) models has marked a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, offering enhanced model capacity and computational efficiency through conditional computation. However, the deployment and inference of these models present substantial challenges in terms of computational resources, latency, and energy efficiency. This comprehensive survey systematically analyzes the current landscape of inference optimization techniques for MoE models across the entire system stack. We first establish a taxonomical framework that categorizes optimization approaches into model-level, system-level, and hardware-level optimizations. At the model level, we examine architectural innovations including efficient expert design, attention mechanisms, various compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, as well as algorithm improvement including dynamic routing strategies and expert merging methods. At the system level, we investigate distributed computing approaches, load balancing mechanisms, and efficient scheduling algorithms that enable scalable deployment. Furthermore, we delve into hardware-specific optimizations and co-design strategies that maximize throughput and energy efficiency. This survey not only provides a structured overview of existing solutions but also identifies key challenges and promising research directions in MoE inference optimization. Our comprehensive analysis serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working on large-scale deployment of MoE models in resource-constrained environments. To facilitate ongoing updates and the sharing of cutting-edge advances in MoE inference optimization research, we have established a repository accessible at \url{https://github.com/MoE-Inf/awesome-moe-inference/}.</description>

      <title>Towards Precise Prediction Uncertainty in GNNs: Refining GNNs with Topology-grouping Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) have highlighted the critical need of calibrating model predictions, with neighborhood prediction similarity recognized as a pivotal component. Existing studies suggest that nodes with analogous neighborhood prediction similarity often exhibit similar calibration characteristics. Building on this insight, recent approaches incorporate neighborhood similarity into node-wise temperature scaling techniques. However, our analysis reveals that this assumption does not hold universally. Calibration errors can differ significantly even among nodes with comparable neighborhood similarity, depending on their confidence levels. This necessitates a re-evaluation of existing GNN calibration methods, as a single, unified approach may lead to sub-optimal calibration. In response, we introduce **Simi-Mailbox**, a novel approach that categorizes nodes by both neighborhood similarity and their own confidence, irrespective of proximity or connectivity. Our method allows fine-grained calibration by employing *group-specific* temperature scaling, with each temperature tailored to address the specific miscalibration level of affiliated nodes, rather than adhering to a uniform trend based on neighborhood similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our **Simi-Mailbox** across diverse datasets on different GNN architectures, achieving up to 13.79\% error reduction compared to uncalibrated GNN predictions.</description>

      <title>FedSTaS: Client Stratification and Client Level Sampling for Efficient Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning methodology that involves the collaborative training of a global model across multiple decentralized clients in a privacy-preserving way. Several FL methods are introduced to tackle communication inefficiencies but do not address how to sample participating clients in each round effectively and in a privacy-preserving manner. In this paper, we propose \textit{FedSTaS}, a client and data-level sampling method inspired by \textit{FedSTS} and \textit{FedSampling}. In each federated learning round, \textit{FedSTaS} stratifies clients based on their compressed gradients, re-allocate the number of clients to sample using an optimal Neyman allocation, and sample local data from each participating clients using a data uniform sampling strategy. Experiments on three datasets show that \textit{FedSTaS} can achieve higher accuracy scores than those of \textit{FedSTS} within a fixed number of training rounds.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Policy Learning under Concept Drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributionally robust policy learning aims to find a policy that performs well under the worst-case distributional shift, and yet most existing methods for robust policy learning consider the worst-case joint distribution of the covariate and the outcome. The joint-modeling strategy can be unnecessarily conservative when we have more information on the source of distributional shifts. This paper studiesa more nuanced problem -- robust policy learning under the concept drift, when only the conditional relationship between the outcome and the covariate changes. To this end, we first provide a doubly-robust estimator for evaluating the worst-case average reward of a given policy under a set of perturbed conditional distributions. We show that the policy value estimator enjoys asymptotic normality even if the nuisance parameters are estimated with a slower-than-root-$n$ rate. We then propose a learning algorithm that outputs the policy maximizing the estimated policy value within a given policy class $\Pi$, and show that the sub-optimality gap of the proposed algorithm is of the order $\kappa(\Pi)n^{-1/2}$, with $\kappa(\Pi)$ is the entropy integral of $\Pi$ under the Hamming distance and $n$ is the sample size. A matching lower bound is provided to show the optimality of the rate. The proposed methods are implemented and evaluated in numerical studies, demonstrating substantial improvement compared with existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>The Multiplex Classification Framework: optimizing multi-label classifiers through problem transformation, ontology engineering, and model ensembling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classification is a fundamental task in machine learning. While conventional methods-such as binary, multiclass, and multi-label classification-are effective for simpler problems, they may not adequately address the complexities of some real-world scenarios. This paper introduces the Multiplex Classification Framework, a novel approach developed to tackle these and similar challenges through the integration of problem transformation, ontology engineering, and model ensembling. The framework offers several advantages, including adaptability to any number of classes and logical constraints, an innovative method for managing class imbalance, the elimination of confidence threshold selection, and a modular structure. Two experiments were conducted to compare the performance of conventional classification models with the Multiplex approach. Our results demonstrate that the Multiplex approach can improve classification performance significantly (up to 10% gain in overall F1 score), particularly in classification problems with a large number of classes and pronounced class imbalances. However, it also has limitations, as it requires a thorough understanding of the problem domain and some experience with ontology engineering, and it involves training multiple models, which can make the whole process more intricate. Overall, this methodology provides a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners dealing with complex classification problems in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Stealing That Free Lunch: Exposing the Limits of Dyna-Style Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dyna-style off-policy model-based reinforcement learning (DMBRL) algorithms are a family of techniques for generating synthetic state transition data and thereby enhancing the sample efficiency of off-policy RL algorithms. This paper identifies and investigates a surprising performance gap observed when applying DMBRL algorithms across different benchmark environments with proprioceptive observations. We show that, while DMBRL algorithms perform well in OpenAI Gym, their performance can drop significantly in DeepMind Control Suite (DMC), even though these settings offer similar tasks and identical physics backends. Modern techniques designed to address several key issues that arise in these settings do not provide a consistent improvement across all environments, and overall our results show that adding synthetic rollouts to the training process -- the backbone of Dyna-style algorithms -- significantly degrades performance across most DMC environments. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of several fundamental challenges in model-based RL and show that, like many optimization fields, there is no free lunch when evaluating performance across diverse benchmarks in RL.</description>

      <title>Covariances for Free: Exploiting Mean Distributions for Federated Learning with Pre-Trained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using pre-trained models has been found to reduce the effect of data heterogeneity and speed up federated learning algorithms. Recent works have investigated the use of first-order statistics and second-order statistics to aggregate local client data distributions at the server and achieve very high performance without any training. In this work we propose a training-free method based on an unbiased estimator of class covariance matrices. Our method, which only uses first-order statistics in the form of class means communicated by clients to the server, incurs only a fraction of the communication costs required by methods based on communicating second-order statistics. We show how these estimated class covariances can be used to initialize a linear classifier, thus exploiting the covariances without actually sharing them. When compared to state-of-the-art methods which also share only class means, our approach improves performance in the range of 4-26\% with exactly the same communication cost. Moreover, our method achieves performance competitive or superior to sharing second-order statistics with dramatically less communication overhead. Finally, using our method to initialize classifiers and then performing federated fine-tuning yields better and faster convergence.

      <title>A Unifying Information-theoretic Perspective on Evaluating Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the difficulty of interpreting generative model output, there is significant current research focused on determining meaningful evaluation metrics. Several recent approaches utilize "precision" and "recall," borrowed from the classification domain, to individually quantify the output fidelity (realism) and output diversity (representation of the real data variation), respectively. With the increase in metric proposals, there is a need for a unifying perspective, allowing for easier comparison and clearer explanation of their benefits and drawbacks. To this end, we unify a class of kth-nearest-neighbors (kNN)-based metrics under an information-theoretic lens using approaches from kNN density estimation. Additionally, we propose a tri-dimensional metric composed of Precision Cross-Entropy (PCE), Recall Cross-Entropy (RCE), and Recall Entropy (RE), which separately measure fidelity and two distinct aspects of diversity, inter- and intra-class. Our domain-agnostic metric, derived from the information-theoretic concepts of entropy and cross-entropy, can be dissected for both sample- and mode-level analysis. Our detailed experimental results demonstrate the sensitivity of our metric components to their respective qualities and reveal undesirable behaviors of other metrics.</description>

      <title>Enabling Realtime Reinforcement Learning at Scale with Staggered Asynchronous Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realtime environments change even as agents perform action inference and learning, thus requiring high interaction frequencies to effectively minimize regret. However, recent advances in machine learning involve larger neural networks with longer inference times, raising questions about their applicability in realtime systems where reaction time is crucial. We present an analysis of lower bounds on regret in realtime reinforcement learning (RL) environments to show that minimizing long-term regret is generally impossible within the typical sequential interaction and learning paradigm, but often becomes possible when sufficient asynchronous compute is available. We propose novel algorithms for staggering asynchronous inference processes to ensure that actions are taken at consistent time intervals, and demonstrate that use of models with high action inference times is only constrained by the environment's effective stochasticity over the inference horizon, and not by action frequency. Our analysis shows that the number of inference processes needed scales linearly with increasing inference times while enabling use of models that are multiple orders of magnitude larger than existing approaches when learning from a realtime simulation of Game Boy games such as Pok\'emon and Tetris.</description>

      <title>ResQ: Mixed-Precision Quantization of Large Language Models with Low-Rank Residuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) of large language models (LLMs) holds the promise in reducing the prohibitive computational cost at inference time. Quantization of all weight, activation and key-value (KV) cache tensors to 4-bit without significantly degrading generalizability is challenging, due to the high quantization error caused by extreme outliers in activations. To tackle this problem, we propose ResQ, a PTQ method that pushes further the state-of-the-art. By means of principal component analysis (PCA), it identifies a low-rank subspace (in practice 1/8 of the hidden dimension) in which activation variances are highest, and keep the coefficients within this subspace in high precision, e.g. 8-bit, while quantizing the rest to 4-bit. Within each subspace, invariant random rotation is applied to further suppress outliers. We show that this is a provably optimal mixed precision quantization scheme that minimizes error. With the Llama families of models, we demonstrate that ResQ outperforms recent uniform and mixed precision PTQ methods on a variety of benchmarks, achieving up to 33% lower perplexity on Wikitext than the next best method SpinQuant, and a 2.4x speedup over 16-bit baseline.

      <title>I0T: Embedding Standardization Method Towards Zero Modality Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) enables zero-shot inference in downstream tasks such as image-text retrieval and classification. However, recent works extending CLIP suffer from the issue of modality gap, which arises when the image and text embeddings are projected to disparate manifolds, deviating from the intended objective of image-text contrastive learning. We discover that this phenomenon is linked to the modality-specific characteristic that each image/text encoder independently possesses and propose two methods to address the modality gap: (1) a post-hoc embedding standardization method, $\text{I0T}_{\text{post}}$ that reduces the modality gap approximately to zero and (2) a trainable method, $\text{I0T}_{\text{async}}$, to alleviate the modality gap problem by adding two normalization layers for each encoder. Our I0T framework can significantly reduce the modality gap while preserving the original embedding representations of trained models with their locked parameters. In practice, $\text{I0T}_{\text{post}}$ can serve as an alternative explainable automatic evaluation metric of widely used CLIPScore (CLIP-S).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DriveGPT, a scalable behavior model for autonomous driving. We model driving as a sequential decision making task, and learn a transformer model to predict future agent states as tokens in an autoregressive fashion. We scale up our model parameters and training data by multiple orders of magnitude, enabling us to explore the scaling properties in terms of dataset size, model parameters, and compute. We evaluate DriveGPT across different scales in a planning task, through both quantitative metrics and qualitative examples including closed-loop driving in complex real-world scenarios. In a separate prediction task, DriveGPT outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline and exhibits improved performance by pretraining on a large-scale dataset, further validating the benefits of data scaling.</description>

      <title>Balanced Gradient Sample Retrieval for Enhanced Knowledge Retention in Proxy-based Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning in deep neural networks often suffers from catastrophic forgetting, where representations for previous tasks are overwritten during subsequent training. We propose a novel sample retrieval strategy from the memory buffer that leverages both gradient-conflicting and gradient-aligned samples to effectively retain knowledge about past tasks within a supervised contrastive learning framework. Gradient-conflicting samples are selected for their potential to reduce interference by re-aligning gradients, thereby preserving past task knowledge. Meanwhile, gradient-aligned samples are incorporated to reinforce stable, shared representations across tasks. By balancing gradient correction from conflicting samples with alignment reinforcement from aligned ones, our approach increases the diversity among retrieved instances and achieves superior alignment in parameter space, significantly enhancing knowledge retention and mitigating proxy drift. Empirical results demonstrate that using both sample types outperforms methods relying solely on one sample type or random retrieval. Experiments on popular continual learning benchmarks in computer vision validate our method's state-of-the-art performance in mitigating forgetting while maintaining competitive accuracy on new tasks.</description>

      <title>Cherry-Picking in Time Series Forecasting: How to Select Datasets to Make Your Model Shine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of time series forecasting drives continuous research and the development of new approaches to tackle this problem. Typically, these methods are introduced through empirical studies that frequently claim superior accuracy for the proposed approaches. Nevertheless, concerns are rising about the reliability and generalizability of these results due to limitations in experimental setups. This paper addresses a critical limitation: the number and representativeness of the datasets used. We investigate the impact of dataset selection bias, particularly the practice of cherry-picking datasets, on the performance evaluation of forecasting methods. Through empirical analysis with a diverse set of benchmark datasets, our findings reveal that cherry-picking datasets can significantly distort the perceived performance of methods, often exaggerating their effectiveness. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that by selectively choosing just four datasets - what most studies report - 46% of methods could be deemed best in class, and 77% could rank within the top three. Additionally, recent deep learning-based approaches show high sensitivity to dataset selection, whereas classical methods exhibit greater robustness. Finally, our results indicate that, when empirically validating forecasting algorithms on a subset of the benchmarks, increasing the number of datasets tested from 3 to 6 reduces the risk of incorrectly identifying an algorithm as the best one by approximately 40%. Our study highlights the critical need for comprehensive evaluation frameworks that more accurately reflect real-world scenarios. Adopting such frameworks will ensure the development of robust and reliable forecasting methods.</description>

      <title>CLDG: Contrastive Learning on Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The graph with complex annotations is the most potent data type, whose constantly evolving motivates further exploration of the unsupervised dynamic graph representation. One of the representative paradigms is graph contrastive learning. It constructs self-supervised signals by maximizing the mutual information between the statistic graph's augmentation views. However, the semantics and labels may change within the augmentation process, causing a significant performance drop in downstream tasks. This drawback becomes greatly magnified on dynamic graphs. To address this problem, we designed a simple yet effective framework named CLDG. Firstly, we elaborate that dynamic graphs have temporal translation invariance at different levels. Then, we proposed a sampling layer to extract the temporally-persistent signals. It will encourage the node to maintain consistent local and global representations, i.e., temporal translation invariance under the timespan views. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method on seven datasets by outperforming eight unsupervised state-of-the-art baselines and showing competitiveness against four semi-supervised methods. Compared with the existing dynamic graph method, the number of model parameters and training time is reduced by an average of 2,001.86 times and 130.31 times on seven datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>HashAttention: Semantic Sparsity for Faster Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing longer contexts is increasingly essential to power better AI systems. However, the cost of attending to long contexts is high due to the involved softmax computation. While the scaled dot-product attention (SDPA) exhibits token sparsity, with only a few pivotal tokens significantly contributing to attention, leveraging this sparsity effectively remains an open challenge. Previous methods either suffer from model degradation or require considerable additional resources. We propose HashAttention --a principled approach casting pivotal token identification as a recommendation problem. Given a query, HashAttention encodes keys and queries in Hamming space capturing the required semantic similarity using learned mapping functions. HashAttention efficiently identifies pivotal tokens for a given query in this Hamming space using bitwise operations, and only these pivotal tokens are used for attention computation, significantly improving overall attention efficiency. HashAttention can reduce the number of tokens used by a factor of $1/32\times$ for the Llama-3.1-8B model with LongBench, keeping average quality loss within 0.6 points, while using only 32 bits per token auxiliary memory. At $32\times$ sparsity, HashAttention is $3{-}6\times$ faster than LightLLM and $2.5{-}4.5\times$ faster than gpt-fast on Nvidia-L4 GPU.</description>

      <title>Benign Overfitting in Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benign overfitting refers to the phenomenon where an over-parameterized model fits the training data perfectly, including noise in the data, but still generalizes well to the unseen test data. While prior work provides some theoretical understanding of this phenomenon under the in-distribution setup, modern machine learning often operates in a more challenging Out-of-Distribution (OOD) regime, where the target (test) distribution can be rather different from the source (training) distribution. In this work, we take an initial step towards understanding benign overfitting in the OOD regime by focusing on the basic setup of over-parameterized linear models under covariate shift. We provide non-asymptotic guarantees proving that benign overfitting occurs in standard ridge regression, even under the OOD regime when the target covariance satisfies certain structural conditions. We identify several vital quantities relating to source and target covariance, which govern the performance of OOD generalization. Our result is sharp, which provably recovers prior in-distribution benign overfitting guarantee [Tsigler and Bartlett, 2023], as well as under-parameterized OOD guarantee [Ge et al., 2024] when specializing to each setup. Moreover, we also present theoretical results for a more general family of target covariance matrix, where standard ridge regression only achieves a slow statistical rate of $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ for the excess risk, while Principal Component Regression (PCR) is guaranteed to achieve the fast rate $O(1/n)$, where $n$ is the number of samples.</description>

      <title>Graph-Structured Topic Modeling for Documents with Spatial or Covariate Dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of incorporating document-level metadata into topic modeling to improve topic mixture estimation. To overcome the computational complexity and lack of theoretical guarantees in existing Bayesian methods, we extend probabilistic latent semantic indexing (pLSI), a frequentist framework for topic modeling, by incorporating document-level covariates or known similarities between documents through a graph formalism. Modeling documents as nodes and edges denoting similarities, we propose a new estimator based on a fast graph-regularized iterative singular value decomposition (SVD) that encourages similar documents to share similar topic mixture proportions. We characterize the estimation error of our proposed method by deriving high-probability bounds and develop a specialized cross-validation method to optimize our regularization parameters. We validate our model through comprehensive experiments on synthetic datasets and three real-world corpora, demonstrating improved performance and faster inference compared to existing Bayesian methods.</description>

      <title>Treatment Effects Estimation on Networked Observational Data using Disentangled Variational Graph Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating individual treatment effect (ITE) from observational data has gained increasing attention across various domains, with a key challenge being the identification of latent confounders affecting both treatment and outcome. Networked observational data offer new opportunities to address this issue by utilizing network information to infer latent confounders. However, most existing approaches assume observed variables and network information serve only as proxy variables for latent confounders, which often fails in practice, as some variables influence treatment but not outcomes, and vice versa. Recent advances in disentangled representation learning, which disentangle latent factors into instrumental, confounding, and adjustment factors, have shown promise for ITE estimation. Building on this, we propose a novel disentangled variational graph autoencoder that learns disentangled factors for treatment effect estimation on networked observational data. Our graph encoder further ensures factor independence using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion. Extensive experiments on two semi-synthetic datasets derived from real-world social networks and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>A hybrid framework for effective and efficient machine unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently machine unlearning (MU) is proposed to remove the imprints of revoked samples from the already trained model parameters, to solve users' privacy concern. Different from the runtime expensive retraining from scratch, there exist two research lines, exact MU and approximate MU with different favorites in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid strategy on top of them to achieve an overall success. It implements the unlearning operation with an acceptable computation cost, while simultaneously improving the accuracy as much as possible. Specifically, it runs reasonable unlearning techniques by estimating the retraining workloads caused by revocations. If the workload is lightweight, it performs retraining to derive the model parameters consistent with the accurate ones retrained from scratch. Otherwise, it outputs the unlearned model by directly modifying the current parameters, for better efficiency. In particular, to improve the accuracy in the latter case, we propose an optimized version to amend the output model with lightweight runtime penalty. We particularly study the boundary of two approaches in our frameworks to adaptively make the smart selection. Extensive experiments on real datasets validate that our proposals can improve the unlearning efficiency by 1.5$\times$ to 8$\times$ while achieving comparable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Cal-DPO: Calibrated Direct Preference Optimization for Language Model Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference data. Contrastive preference optimization has shown promising results in aligning LLMs with available preference data by optimizing the implicit reward associated with the policy. However, the contrastive objective focuses mainly on the relative values of implicit rewards associated with two responses while ignoring their actual values, resulting in suboptimal alignment with human preferences. To address this limitation, we propose calibrated direct preference optimization (Cal-DPO), a simple yet effective algorithm. We show that substantial improvement in alignment with the given preferences can be achieved simply by calibrating the implicit reward to ensure that the learned implicit rewards are comparable in scale to the ground-truth rewards. We demonstrate the theoretical advantages of Cal-DPO over existing approaches. The results of our experiments on a variety of standard benchmarks show that Cal-DPO remarkably improves off-the-shelf methods.</description>

      <title>CAE-T: A Channelwise AutoEncoder with Transformer for EEG Abnormality Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are critical for detecting abnormal brain activity, but their high dimensionality and complexity pose significant challenges for effective analysis. In this paper, we propose CAE-T, a novel framework that combines a channelwise CNN-based autoencoder with a single-head transformer classifier for efficient EEG abnormality detection. The channelwise autoencoder compresses raw EEG signals while preserving channel independence, reducing computational costs and retaining biologically meaningful features. The compressed representations are then fed into the transformer-based classifier, which efficiently models long-term dependencies to distinguish between normal and abnormal signals. Evaluated on the TUH Abnormal EEG Corpus, the proposed model achieves 85.0% accuracy, 76.2% sensitivity, and 91.2% specificity at the per-case level, outperforming baseline models such as EEGNet, Deep4Conv, and FusionCNN. Furthermore, CAE-T requires only 202M FLOPs and 2.9M parameters, making it significantly more efficient than transformer-based alternatives. The framework retains interpretability through its channelwise design, demonstrating great potential for future applications in neuroscience research and clinical practice.

      <title>Knowledge Distillation in RNN-Attention Models for Early Prediction of Student Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Educational data mining (EDM) is a part of applied computing that focuses on automatically analyzing data from learning contexts. Early prediction for identifying at-risk students is a crucial and widely researched topic in EDM research. It enables instructors to support at-risk students to stay on track, preventing student dropout or failure. Previous studies have predicted students' learning performance to identify at-risk students by using machine learning on data collected from e-learning platforms. However, most studies aimed to identify at-risk students utilizing the entire course data after the course finished. This does not correspond to the real-world scenario that at-risk students may drop out before the course ends. To address this problem, we introduce an RNN-Attention-KD (knowledge distillation) framework to predict at-risk students early throughout a course. It leverages the strengths of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in handling time-sequence data to predict students' performance at each time step and employs an attention mechanism to focus on relevant time steps for improved predictive accuracy. At the same time, KD is applied to compress the time steps to facilitate early prediction. In an empirical evaluation, RNN-Attention-KD outperforms traditional neural network models in terms of recall and F1-measure. For example, it obtained recall and F1-measure of 0.49 and 0.51 for Weeks 1--3 and 0.51 and 0.61 for Weeks 1--6 across all datasets from four years of a university course. Then, an ablation study investigated the contributions of different knowledge transfer methods (distillation objectives). We found that hint loss from the hidden layer of RNN and context vector loss from the attention module on RNN could enhance the model's prediction performance for identifying at-risk students. These results are relevant for EDM researchers employing deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Time Series Categorization and Temporal Fusion Transformers to Improve Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organizing and managing cryptocurrency portfolios and decision-making on transactions is crucial in this market. Optimal selection of assets is one of the main challenges that requires accurate prediction of the price of cryptocurrencies. In this work, we categorize the financial time series into several similar subseries to increase prediction accuracy by learning each subseries category with similar behavior. For each category of the subseries, we create a deep learning model based on the attention mechanism to predict the next step of each subseries. Due to the limited amount of cryptocurrency data for training models, if the number of categories increases, the amount of training data for each model will decrease, and some complex models will not be trained well due to the large number of parameters. To overcome this challenge, we propose to combine the time series data of other cryptocurrencies to increase the amount of data for each category, hence increasing the accuracy of the models corresponding to each category.</description>

      <title>ST-ReP: Learning Predictive Representations Efficiently for Spatial-Temporal Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial-temporal forecasting is crucial and widely applicable in various domains such as traffic, energy, and climate. Benefiting from the abundance of unlabeled spatial-temporal data, self-supervised methods are increasingly adapted to learn spatial-temporal representations. However, it encounters three key challenges: 1) the difficulty in selecting reliable negative pairs due to the homogeneity of variables, hindering contrastive learning methods; 2) overlooking spatial correlations across variables over time; 3) limitations of efficiency and scalability in existing self-supervised learning methods. To tackle these, we propose a lightweight representation-learning model ST-ReP, integrating current value reconstruction and future value prediction into the pre-training framework for spatial-temporal forecasting. And we design a new spatial-temporal encoder to model fine-grained relationships. Moreover, multi-time scale analysis is incorporated into the self-supervised loss to enhance predictive capability. Experimental results across diverse domains demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses pre-training-based baselines, showcasing its ability to learn compact and semantically enriched representations while exhibiting superior scalability.</description>

      <title>Downscaling Precipitation with Bias-informed Conditional Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change is intensifying rainfall extremes, making high-resolution precipitation projections crucial for society to better prepare for impacts such as flooding. However, current Global Climate Models (GCMs) operate at spatial resolutions too coarse for localized analyses. To address this limitation, deep learning-based statistical downscaling methods offer promising solutions, providing high-resolution precipitation projections with a moderate computational cost. In this work, we introduce a bias-informed conditional diffusion model for statistical downscaling of precipitation. Specifically, our model leverages a conditional diffusion approach to learn distribution priors from large-scale, high-resolution precipitation datasets. The long-tail distribution of precipitation poses a unique challenge for training diffusion models; to address this, we apply gamma correction during preprocessing. Additionally, to correct biases in the downscaled results, we employ a guided-sampling strategy to enhance bias correction. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves highly accurate results in an 8 times downscaling setting, outperforming previous deterministic methods.

      <title>Single-Loop Federated Actor-Critic across Heterogeneous Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated reinforcement learning (FRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm, enabling multiple agents to collaborate and learn a shared policy adaptable across heterogeneous environments. Among the various reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, the actor-critic (AC) algorithm stands out for its low variance and high sample efficiency. However, little to nothing is known theoretically about AC in a federated manner, especially each agent interacts with a potentially different environment. The lack of such results is attributed to various technical challenges: a two-level structure illustrating the coupling effect between the actor and the critic, heterogeneous environments, Markovian sampling and multiple local updates. In response, we study \textit{Single-loop Federated Actor Critic} (SFAC) where agents perform actor-critic learning in a two-level federated manner while interacting with heterogeneous environments. We then provide bounds on the convergence error of SFAC. The results show that the convergence error asymptotically converges to a near-stationary point, with the extent proportional to environment heterogeneity. Moreover, the sample complexity exhibits a linear speed-up through the federation of agents. We evaluate the performance of SFAC through numerical experiments using common RL benchmarks, which demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Global Spatio-Temporal Fusion-based Traffic Prediction Algorithm with Anomaly Aware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic prediction is an indispensable component of urban planning and traffic management. Achieving accurate traffic prediction hinges on the ability to capture the potential spatio-temporal relationships among road sensors. However, the majority of existing works focus on local short-term spatio-temporal correlations, failing to fully consider the interactions of different sensors in the long-term state. In addition, these works do not analyze the influences of anomalous factors, or have insufficient ability to extract personalized features of anomalous factors, which make them ineffectively capture their spatio-temporal influences on traffic prediction. To address the aforementioned issues, We propose a global spatio-temporal fusion-based traffic prediction algorithm that incorporates anomaly awareness. Initially, based on the designed anomaly detection network, we construct an efficient anomalous factors impacting module (AFIM), to evaluate the spatio-temporal impact of unexpected external events on traffic prediction. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale spatio-temporal feature fusion module (MTSFFL) based on the transformer architecture, to obtain all possible both long and short term correlations among different sensors in a wide-area traffic environment for accurate prediction of traffic flow. Finally, experiments are implemented based on real-scenario public transportation datasets (PEMS04 and PEMS08) to demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>MixLLM: LLM Quantization with Global Mixed-precision between Output-features and Highly-efficient System Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization has become one of the most effective methodologies to compress LLMs into smaller size. However, the existing quantization solutions still show limitations of either non-negligible accuracy drop or system inefficiency. In this paper, we make a comprehensive analysis of the general quantization principles on their effect to the triangle of accuracy, memory consumption and system efficiency. We propose MixLLM that explores the new optimization space of mixed-precision quantization between output features based on the insight that different output features matter differently in the model. MixLLM identifies the output features with high salience in the global view rather than within each single layer, effectively assigning the larger bit-width to output features that need it most to achieve good accuracy with low memory consumption. We present the sweet spot of quantization configuration of algorithm-system co-design that leads to high accuracy and system efficiency. To address the system challenge, we design the two-step dequantization to make use of the int8 Tensor Core easily and fast data type conversion to reduce dequantization overhead significantly, and present the software pipeline to overlap the memory access, dequantization and the MatMul to the best. Extensive experiments show that with only 10% more bits, the PPL increasement can be reduced from about 0.5 in SOTA to within 0.2 for Llama 3.1 70B, while on average MMLU-Pro improves by 0.93 over the SOTA of three popular models. In addition to its superior accuracy, MixLLM also achieves state-of-the-art system efficiency.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable and Deep Graph Neural Networks via Noise Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in many graph mining tasks. However, scaling them to large graphs is challenging due to the high computational and storage costs of repeated feature propagation and non-linear transformation during training. One commonly employed approach to address this challenge is model-simplification, which only executes the Propagation (P) once in the pre-processing, and Combine (C) these receptive fields in different ways and then feed them into a simple model for better performance. Despite their high predictive performance and scalability, these methods still face two limitations. First, existing approaches mainly focus on exploring different C methods from the model perspective, neglecting the crucial problem of performance degradation with increasing P depth from the data-centric perspective, known as the over-smoothing problem. Second, pre-processing overhead takes up most of the end-to-end processing time, especially for large-scale graphs. To address these limitations, we present random walk with noise masking (RMask), a plug-and-play module compatible with the existing model-simplification works. This module enables the exploration of deeper GNNs while preserving their scalability. Unlike the previous model-simplification works, we focus on continuous P and found that the noise existing inside each P is the cause of the over-smoothing issue, and use the efficient masking mechanism to eliminate them. Experimental results on six real-world datasets demonstrate that model-simplification works equipped with RMask yield superior performance compared to their original version and can make a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Continuous latent representations for modeling precipitation with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sparse and spatio-temporally discontinuous nature of precipitation data presents significant challenges for simulation and statistical processing for bias correction and downscaling. These include incorrect representation of intermittency and extreme values (critical for hydrology applications), Gibbs phenomenon upon regridding, and lack of fine scales details. To address these challenges, a common approach is to transform the precipitation variable nonlinearly into one that is more malleable. In this work, we explore how deep learning can be used to generate a smooth, spatio-temporally continuous variable as a proxy for simulation of precipitation data. We develop a normally distributed field called pseudo-precipitation (PP) as an alternative for simulating precipitation. The practical applicability of this variable is investigated by applying it for downscaling precipitation from \(1\degree\) (\(\sim\) 100 km) to \(0.25\degree\) (\(\sim\) 25 km).</description>

      <title>Robust PCA Based on Adaptive Weighted Least Squares and Low-Rank Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) is a fundamental technique for decomposing data into low-rank and sparse components, which plays a critical role for applications such as image processing and anomaly detection. Traditional RPCA methods commonly use $\ell_1$ norm regularization to enforce sparsity, but this approach can introduce bias and result in suboptimal estimates, particularly in the presence of significant noise or outliers. Non-convex regularization methods have been proposed to mitigate these challenges, but they tend to be complex to optimize and sensitive to initial conditions, leading to potential instability in solutions. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel RPCA model that integrates adaptive weighted least squares (AWLS) and low-rank matrix factorization (LRMF). The model employs a {self-attention-inspired} mechanism in its weight update process, allowing the weight matrix to dynamically adjust and emphasize significant components during each iteration. By employing a weighted F-norm for the sparse component, our method effectively reduces bias while simplifying the computational process compared to traditional $\ell_1$-norm-based methods. We use an alternating minimization algorithm, where each subproblem has an explicit solution, thereby improving computational efficiency. Despite its simplicity, numerical experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing non-convex regularization approaches, offering superior performance and stability, as well as enhanced accuracy and robustness in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Trainable Adaptive Activation Function Structure (TAAFS) Enhances Neural Network Force Field Performance with Only Dozens of Additional Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the heart of neural network force fields (NNFFs) is the architecture of neural networks, where the capacity to model complex interactions is typically enhanced through widening or deepening multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) or by increasing layers of graph neural networks (GNNs). These enhancements, while improving the model's performance, often come at the cost of a substantial increase in the number of parameters. By applying the Trainable Adaptive Activation Function Structure (TAAFS), we introduce a method that selects distinct mathematical formulations for non-linear activations, thereby increasing the precision of NNFFs with an insignificant addition to the parameter count. In this study, we integrate TAAFS into a variety of neural network models, resulting in observed accuracy improvements, and further validate these enhancements through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using DeepMD.</description>

      <title>LoLaFL: Low-Latency Federated Learning via Forward-only Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a widely adopted paradigm for enabling edge learning with distributed data while ensuring data privacy. However, the traditional FL with deep neural networks trained via backpropagation can hardly meet the low-latency learning requirements in the sixth generation (6G) mobile networks. This challenge mainly arises from the high-dimensional model parameters to be transmitted and the numerous rounds of communication required for convergence due to the inherent randomness of the training process. To address this issue, we adopt the state-of-the-art principle of maximal coding rate reduction to learn linear discriminative features and extend the resultant white-box neural network into FL, yielding the novel framework of Low-Latency Federated Learning (LoLaFL) via forward-only propagation. LoLaFL enables layer-wise transmissions and aggregation with significantly fewer communication rounds, thereby considerably reducing latency. Additionally, we propose two \emph{nonlinear} aggregation schemes for LoLaFL. The first scheme is based on the proof that the optimal NN parameter aggregation in LoLaFL should be harmonic-mean-like. The second scheme further exploits the low-rank structures of the features and transmits the low-rank-approximated covariance matrices of features to achieve additional latency reduction. Theoretic analysis and experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of LoLaFL. In comparison with traditional FL, the two nonlinear aggregation schemes for LoLaFL can achieve reductions in latency of over 91\% and 98\%, respectively, while maintaining comparable accuracies.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Residual Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling hierarchical data structures prevalent in real-world datasets. Notably, residual connections, which facilitate the direct flow of information across layers, have been instrumental in the success of deep neural networks. However, current methods for constructing hyperbolic residual networks suffer from limitations such as increased model complexity, numerical instability, and errors due to multiple mappings to and from the tangent space. To address these limitations, we introduce LResNet, a novel Lorentzian residual neural network based on the weighted Lorentzian centroid in the Lorentz model of hyperbolic geometry. Our method enables the efficient integration of residual connections in Lorentz hyperbolic neural networks while preserving their hierarchical representation capabilities. We demonstrate that our method can theoretically derive previous methods while offering improved stability, efficiency, and effectiveness. Extensive experiments on both graph and vision tasks showcase the superior performance and robustness of our method compared to state-of-the-art Euclidean and hyperbolic alternatives. Our findings highlight the potential of \method for building more expressive neural networks in hyperbolic embedding space as a generally applicable method to multiple architectures, including CNNs, GNNs, and graph Transformers.</description>

      <title>ReMoE: Fully Differentiable Mixture-of-Experts with ReLU Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are widely adopted to scale up model capacity without increasing the computation budget. However, vanilla TopK routers are trained in a discontinuous, non-differentiable way, limiting their performance and scalability. To address this issue, we propose ReMoE, a fully differentiable MoE architecture that offers a simple yet effective drop-in replacement for the conventional TopK+Softmax routing, utilizing ReLU as the router instead. We further propose methods to regulate the router's sparsity while balancing the load among experts. ReMoE's continuous nature enables efficient dynamic allocation of computation across tokens and layers, while also exhibiting domain specialization. Our experiments demonstrate that ReMoE consistently outperforms vanilla TopK-routed MoE across various model sizes, expert counts, and levels of granularity. Furthermore, ReMoE exhibits superior scalability with respect to the number of experts, surpassing traditional MoE architectures. The implementation based on Megatron-LM is available at https://github.com/thu-ml/ReMoE.</description>

      <title>Holistic Adversarially Robust Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks can be drastically shrunk in size by removing redundant parameters. While crucial for the deployment on resource-constraint hardware, oftentimes, compression comes with a severe drop in accuracy and lack of adversarial robustness. Despite recent advances, counteracting both aspects has only succeeded for moderate compression rates so far. We propose a novel method, HARP, that copes with aggressive pruning significantly better than prior work. For this, we consider the network holistically. We learn a global compression strategy that optimizes how many parameters (compression rate) and which parameters (scoring connections) to prune specific to each layer individually. Our method fine-tunes an existing model with dynamic regularization, that follows a step-wise incremental function balancing the different objectives. It starts by favoring robustness before shifting focus on reaching the target compression rate and only then handles the objectives equally. The learned compression strategies allow us to maintain the pre-trained model natural accuracy and its adversarial robustness for a reduction by 99% of the network original size. Moreover, we observe a crucial influence of non-uniform compression across layers.</description>

      <title>Computing Gram Matrix for SMILES Strings using RDKFingerprint and Sinkhorn-Knopp Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In molecular structure data, SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings are used to analyze molecular structure design. Numerical feature representation of SMILES strings is a challenging task. This work proposes a kernel-based approach for encoding and analyzing molecular structures from SMILES strings. The proposed approach involves computing a kernel matrix using the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm while using kernel principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. The resulting low-dimensional embeddings are then used for classification and regression analysis. The kernel matrix is computed by converting the SMILES strings into molecular structures using the Morgan Fingerprint, which computes a fingerprint for each molecule. The distance matrix is computed using the pairwise kernels function. The Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm is used to compute the final kernel matrix that satisfies the constraints of a probability distribution. This is achieved by iteratively adjusting the kernel matrix until the marginal distributions of the rows and columns match the desired marginal distributions. We provided a comprehensive empirical analysis of the proposed kernel method to evaluate its goodness with greater depth. The suggested method is assessed for drug subcategory prediction (classification task) and solubility AlogPS ``Aqueous solubility and Octanol/Water partition coefficient" (regression task) using the benchmark SMILES string dataset. The outcomes show the proposed method outperforms several baseline methods in terms of supervised analysis and has potential uses in molecular design and drug discovery. Overall, the suggested method is a promising avenue for kernel methods-based molecular structure analysis and design.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Forecasting Framework based on Multi-Stage Hierarchical Forecasting Reconciliation and Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ads demand forecasting for Walmart's ad products plays a critical role in enabling effective resource planning, allocation, and management of ads performance. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive demand forecasting system that tackles hierarchical time series forecasting in business settings. Though traditional hierarchical reconciliation methods ensure forecasting coherence, they often trade off accuracy for coherence especially at lower levels and fail to capture the seasonality unique to each time-series in the hierarchy. Thus, we propose a novel framework "Multi-Stage Hierarchical Forecasting Reconciliation and Adjustment (Multi-Stage HiFoReAd)" to address the challenges of preserving seasonality, ensuring coherence, and improving accuracy. Our system first utilizes diverse models, ensembled through Bayesian Optimization (BO), achieving base forecasts. The generated base forecasts are then passed into the Multi-Stage HiFoReAd framework. The initial stage refines the hierarchy using Top-Down forecasts and "harmonic alignment." The second stage aligns the higher levels' forecasts using MinTrace algorithm, following which the last two levels undergo "harmonic alignment" and "stratified scaling", to eventually achieve accurate and coherent forecasts across the whole hierarchy. Our experiments on Walmart's internal Ads-demand dataset and 3 other public datasets, each with 4 hierarchical levels, demonstrate that the average Absolute Percentage Error from the cross-validation sets improve from 3% to 40% across levels against BO-ensemble of models (LGBM, MSTL+ETS, Prophet) as well as from 1.2% to 92.9% against State-Of-The-Art models. In addition, the forecasts at all hierarchical levels are proved to be coherent. The proposed framework has been deployed and leveraged by Walmart's ads, sales and operations teams to track future demands, make informed decisions and plan resources.</description>

      <title>FROC: Building Fair ROC from a Trained Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of fair probabilistic binary classification with binary protected groups. The classifier assigns scores, and a practitioner predicts labels using a certain cut-off threshold based on the desired trade-off between false positives vs. false negatives. It derives these thresholds from the ROC of the classifier. The resultant classifier may be unfair to one of the two protected groups in the dataset. It is desirable that no matter what threshold the practitioner uses, the classifier should be fair to both the protected groups; that is, the $\mathcal{L}_p$ norm between FPRs and TPRs of both the protected groups should be at most $\varepsilon$. We call such fairness on ROCs of both the protected attributes $\varepsilon_p$-Equalized ROC. Given a classifier not satisfying $\varepsilon_1$-Equalized ROC, we aim to design a post-processing method to transform the given (potentially unfair) classifier's output (score) to a suitable randomized yet fair classifier. That is, the resultant classifier must satisfy $\varepsilon_1$-Equalized ROC. First, we introduce a threshold query model on the ROC curves for each protected group. The resulting classifier is bound to face a reduction in AUC. With the proposed query model, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the minimal AUC loss to achieve $\varepsilon_1$-Equalized ROC. To achieve this, we design a linear time algorithm, namely \texttt{FROC}, to transform a given classifier's output to a probabilistic classifier that satisfies $\varepsilon_1$-Equalized ROC. We prove that under certain theoretical conditions, \texttt{FROC}\ achieves the theoretical optimal guarantees. We also study the performance of our \texttt{FROC}\ on multiple real-world datasets with many trained classifiers.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Banks: Benchmarks and Algorithms for Synthetic Financial Transaction Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The banking sector faces challenges in using deep learning due to data sensitivity and regulatory constraints, but generative AI may offer a solution. Thus, this study identifies effective algorithms for generating synthetic financial transaction data and evaluates five leading models - Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN), DoppelGANger (DGAN), Wasserstein GAN, Financial Diffusion (FinDiff), and Tabular Variational AutoEncoders (TVAE) - across five criteria: fidelity, synthesis quality, efficiency, privacy, and graph structure. While none of the algorithms is able to replicate the real data's graph structure, each excels in specific areas: DGAN is ideal for privacy-sensitive tasks, FinDiff and TVAE excel in data replication and augmentation, and CTGAN achieves a balance across all five criteria, making it suitable for general applications with moderate privacy concerns. As a result, our findings offer valuable insights for choosing the most suitable algorithm.</description>

      <title>Boosting GNN Performance via Training Sample Selection Based on Adversarial Robustness Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have established themselves as one of the most powerful neural network architectures, excelling in leveraging graph topology and node features for various tasks. However, GNNs are inherently vulnerable to noise in their inputs. Such noise can significantly degrade their performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that employs adversarial robustness evaluation techniques to identify nodes in the graph that are most susceptible to noise. By selecting and constructing a training set composed of these particularly noise-prone nodes, we then use them to train a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Our experimental results demonstrate that this strategy leads to substantial improvements in the GCN's performance.</description>

      <title>A parametric algorithm is optimal for non-parametric regression of smooth functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the regression problem for a general function $f:[-1,1]^d\to \mathbb R$ when the learner selects the training points $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n$ to achieve a uniform error bound across the entire domain. In this setting, known historically as nonparametric regression, we aim to establish a sample complexity bound that depends solely on the function's degree of smoothness. Assuming periodicity at the domain boundaries, we introduce PADUA, an algorithm that, with high probability, provides performance guarantees optimal up to constant or logarithmic factors across all problem parameters. Notably, PADUA is the first parametric algorithm with optimal sample complexity for this setting. Due to this feature, we prove that, differently from the non-parametric state of the art, PADUA enjoys optimal space complexity in the prediction phase. To validate these results, we perform numerical experiments over functions coming from real audio data, where PADUA shows comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods, while requiring only a fraction of the computational time.</description>

      <title>Extending TWIG: Zero-Shot Predictive Hyperparameter Selection for KGEs based on Graph Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have seen increasing use across various domains -- from biomedicine and linguistics to general knowledge modelling. In order to facilitate the analysis of knowledge graphs, Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) have been developed to automatically analyse KGs and predict new facts based on the information in a KG, a task called "link prediction". Many existing studies have documented that the structure of a KG, KGE model components, and KGE hyperparameters can significantly change how well KGEs perform and what relationships they are able to learn. Recently, the Topologically-Weighted Intelligence Generation (TWIG) model has been proposed as a solution to modelling how each of these elements relate. In this work, we extend the previous research on TWIG and evaluate its ability to simulate the output of the KGE model ComplEx in the cross-KG setting. Our results are twofold. First, TWIG is able to summarise KGE performance on a wide range of hyperparameter settings and KGs being learned, suggesting that it represents a general knowledge of how to predict KGE performance from KG structure. Second, we show that TWIG can successfully predict hyperparameter performance on unseen KGs in the zero-shot setting. This second observation leads us to propose that, with additional research, optimal hyperparameter selection for KGE models could be determined in a pre-hoc manner using TWIG-like methods, rather than by using a full hyperparameter search.</description>

      <title>MARIA: a Multimodal Transformer Model for Incomplete Healthcare Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In healthcare, the integration of multimodal data is pivotal for developing comprehensive diagnostic and predictive models. However, managing missing data remains a significant challenge in real-world applications. We introduce MARIA (Multimodal Attention Resilient to Incomplete datA), a novel transformer-based deep learning model designed to address these challenges through an intermediate fusion strategy. Unlike conventional approaches that depend on imputation, MARIA utilizes a masked self-attention mechanism, which processes only the available data without generating synthetic values. This approach enables it to effectively handle incomplete datasets, enhancing robustness and minimizing biases introduced by imputation methods. We evaluated MARIA against 10 state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models across 8 diagnostic and prognostic tasks. The results demonstrate that MARIA outperforms existing methods in terms of performance and resilience to varying levels of data incompleteness, underscoring its potential for critical healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Entropy Regularized Task Representation Learning for Offline Meta-Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline meta-reinforcement learning aims to equip agents with the ability to rapidly adapt to new tasks by training on data from a set of different tasks. Context-based approaches utilize a history of state-action-reward transitions -- referred to as the context -- to infer representations of the current task, and then condition the agent, i.e., the policy and value function, on the task representations. Intuitively, the better the task representations capture the underlying tasks, the better the agent can generalize to new tasks. Unfortunately, context-based approaches suffer from distribution mismatch, as the context in the offline data does not match the context at test time, limiting their ability to generalize to the test tasks. This leads to the task representations overfitting to the offline training data. Intuitively, the task representations should be independent of the behavior policy used to collect the offline data. To address this issue, we approximately minimize the mutual information between the distribution over the task representations and behavior policy by maximizing the entropy of behavior policy conditioned on the task representations. We validate our approach in MuJoCo environments, showing that compared to baselines, our task representations more faithfully represent the underlying tasks, leading to outperforming prior methods in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Subspaces of Policies for Continual Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dynamic domains such as autonomous robotics and video game simulations, agents must continuously adapt to new tasks while retaining previously acquired skills. This ongoing process, known as Continual Reinforcement Learning, presents significant challenges, including the risk of forgetting past knowledge and the need for scalable solutions as the number of tasks increases. To address these issues, we introduce HIerarchical LOW-rank Subspaces of Policies (HILOW), a novel framework designed for continual learning in offline navigation settings. HILOW leverages hierarchical policy subspaces to enable flexible and efficient adaptation to new tasks while preserving existing knowledge. We demonstrate, through a careful experimental study, the effectiveness of our method in both classical MuJoCo maze environments and complex video game-like simulations, showcasing competitive performance and satisfying adaptability according to classical continual learning metrics, in particular regarding memory usage. Our work provides a promising framework for real-world applications where continuous learning from pre-collected data is essential.</description>

      <title>Diffusion priors for Bayesian 3D reconstruction from incomplete measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many inverse problems are ill-posed and need to be complemented by prior information that restricts the class of admissible models. Bayesian approaches encode this information as prior distributions that impose generic properties on the model such as sparsity, non-negativity or smoothness. However, in case of complex structured models such as images, graphs or three-dimensional (3D) objects,generic prior distributions tend to favor models that differ largely from those observed in the real world. Here we explore the use of diffusion models as priors that are combined with experimental data within a Bayesian framework. We use 3D point clouds to represent 3D objects such as household items or biomolecular complexes formed from proteins and nucleic acids. We train diffusion models that generate coarse-grained 3D structures at a medium resolution and integrate these with incomplete and noisy experimental data. To demonstrate the power of our approach, we focus on the reconstruction of biomolecular assemblies from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images, which is an important inverse problem in structural biology. We find that posterior sampling with diffusion model priors allows for 3D reconstruction from very sparse, low-resolution and partial observations.</description>

      <title>Robust Federated Learning in the Face of Covariate Shift: A Magnitude Pruning with Hybrid Regularization Framework for Enhanced Model Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of highly sophisticated neural networks has allowed for fast progress in every field of computer vision, however, applications where annotated data is prohibited due to privacy or security concerns remain challenging. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising framework for individuals aiming to collaboratively develop a shared model while preserving data privacy. Nevertheless, our findings reveal that variations in data distribution among clients can profoundly affect FL methodologies, primarily due to instabilities in the aggregation process. We also propose a novel FL framework to mitigate the adverse effects of covariate shifts among federated clients by combining individual parameter pruning and regularization techniques to improve the robustness of individual clients' models to aggregate. Each client's model is optimized through magnitude-based pruning and the addition of dropout and noise injection layers to build more resilient decision pathways in the networks and improve the robustness of the model's parameter aggregation step. The proposed framework is capable of extracting robust representations even in the presence of very large covariate shifts among client data distributions and in the federation of a small number of clients. Empirical findings substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology across common benchmark datasets, including CIFAR10, MNIST, SVHN, and Fashion MNIST. Furthermore, we introduce the CelebA-Gender dataset, specifically designed to evaluate performance on a more realistic domain. The proposed method is capable of extracting robust representations even in the presence of both high and low covariate shifts among client data distributions.</description>

      <title>DroughtSet: Understanding Drought Through Spatial-Temporal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drought is one of the most destructive and expensive natural disasters, severely impacting natural resources and risks by depleting water resources and diminishing agricultural yields. Under climate change, accurately predicting drought is critical for mitigating drought-induced risks. However, the intricate interplay among the physical and biological drivers that regulate droughts limits the predictability and understanding of drought, particularly at a subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) time scale. While deep learning has been demonstrated with potential in addressing climate forecasting challenges, its application to drought prediction has received relatively less attention. In this work, we propose a new dataset, DroughtSet, which integrates relevant predictive features and three drought indices from multiple remote sensing and reanalysis datasets across the contiguous United States (CONUS). DroughtSet specifically provides the machine learning community with a new real-world dataset to benchmark drought prediction models and more generally, time-series forecasting methods. Furthermore, we propose a spatial-temporal model SPDrought to predict and interpret S2S droughts. Our model learns from the spatial and temporal information of physical and biological features to predict three types of droughts simultaneously. Multiple strategies are employed to quantify the importance of physical and biological features for drought prediction. Our results provide insights for researchers to better understand the predictability and sensitivity of drought to biological and physical conditions. We aim to contribute to the climate field by proposing a new tool to predict and understand the occurrence of droughts and provide the AI community with a new benchmark to study deep learning applications in climate science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today, deep neural networks are widely used since they can handle a variety of complex tasks. Their generality makes them very powerful tools in modern technology. However, deep neural networks are often overparameterized. The usage of these large models consumes a lot of computation resources. In this paper, we introduce a method called \textbf{T}ill the \textbf{L}ayers \textbf{C}ollapse (TLC), which compresses deep neural networks through the lenses of batch normalization layers. By reducing the depth of these networks, our method decreases deep neural networks' computational requirements and overall latency. We validate our method on popular models such as Swin-T, MobileNet-V2, and RoBERTa, across both image classification and natural language processing (NLP) tasks.</description>

      <title>Learning Disentangled Equivariant Representation for Explicitly Controllable 3D Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the conditional generation of 3D drug-like molecules with \textit{explicit control} over molecular properties such as drug-like properties (e.g., Quantitative Estimate of Druglikeness or Synthetic Accessibility score) and effectively binding to specific protein sites. To tackle this problem, we propose an E(3)-equivariant Wasserstein autoencoder and factorize the latent space of our generative model into two disentangled aspects: molecular properties and the remaining structural context of 3D molecules. Our model ensures explicit control over these molecular attributes while maintaining equivariance of coordinate representation and invariance of data likelihood. Furthermore, we introduce a novel alignment-based coordinate loss to adapt equivariant networks for auto-regressive de-novo 3D molecule generation from scratch. Extensive experiments validate our model's effectiveness on property-guided and context-guided molecule generation, both for de-novo 3D molecule design and structure-based drug discovery against protein targets.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Uncertainty Estimation in Natural Language Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in real-world applications, driving the need to evaluate the trustworthiness of their generated text. To this end, reliable uncertainty estimation is essential. Since current LLMs generate text autoregressively through a stochastic process, the same prompt can lead to varying outputs. Consequently, leading uncertainty estimation methods generate and analyze multiple output sequences to determine the LLM's uncertainty. However, generating output sequences is computationally expensive, making these methods impractical at scale. In this work, we inspect the theoretical foundations of the leading methods and explore new directions to enhance their computational efficiency. Building on the framework of proper scoring rules, we find that the negative log-likelihood of the most likely output sequence constitutes a theoretically grounded uncertainty measure. To approximate this alternative measure, we propose G-NLL, which has the advantage of being obtained using only a single output sequence generated by greedy decoding. This makes uncertainty estimation more efficient and straightforward, while preserving theoretical rigor. Empirical results demonstrate that G-NLL achieves state-of-the-art performance across various LLMs and tasks. Our work lays the foundation for efficient and reliable uncertainty estimation in natural language generation, challenging the necessity of more computationally involved methods currently leading the field.</description>

      <title>Data for Mathematical Copilots: Better Ways of Presenting Proofs for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The suite of datasets commonly used to train and evaluate the mathematical capabilities of AI-based mathematical copilots (primarily large language models) exhibit several shortcomings. These limitations include a restricted scope of mathematical complexity, typically not exceeding lower undergraduate-level mathematics, binary rating protocols and other issues, which makes comprehensive proof-based evaluation suites difficult. We systematically explore these limitations and contend that enhancing the capabilities of large language models, or any forthcoming advancements in AI-based mathematical assistants (copilots or "thought partners"), necessitates a paradigm shift in the design of mathematical datasets and the evaluation criteria of mathematical ability: It is necessary to move away from result-based datasets (theorem statement to theorem proof) and convert the rich facets of mathematical research practice to data LLMs can train on. Examples of these are mathematical workflows (sequences of atomic, potentially subfield-dependent tasks that are often performed when creating new mathematics), which are an important part of the proof-discovery process. Additionally, we advocate for mathematical dataset developers to consider the concept of "motivated proof", introduced by G. P\'olya in 1949, which can serve as a blueprint for datasets that offer a better proof learning signal, alleviating some of the mentioned limitations. Lastly, we introduce math datasheets for datasets, extending the general, dataset-agnostic variants of datasheets: We provide a questionnaire designed specifically for math datasets that we urge dataset creators to include with their datasets. This will make creators aware of potential limitations of their datasets while at the same time making it easy for readers to assess it from the point of view of training and evaluating mathematical copilots.</description>

      <title>On Convex Optimal Value Functions For POSGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09459v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent planning and reinforcement learning can be challenging when agents cannot see the state of the world or communicate with each other due to communication costs, latency, or noise. Partially Observable Stochastic Games (POSGs) provide a mathematical framework for modelling such scenarios. This paper aims to improve the efficiency of planning and reinforcement learning algorithms for POSGs by identifying the underlying structure of optimal state-value functions. The approach involves reformulating the original game from the perspective of a trusted third party who plans on behalf of the agents simultaneously. From this viewpoint, the original POSGs can be viewed as Markov games where states are occupancy states, \ie posterior probability distributions over the hidden states of the world and the stream of actions and observations that agents have experienced so far. This study mainly proves that the optimal state-value function is a convex function of occupancy states expressed on an appropriate basis in all zero-sum, common-payoff, and Stackelberg POSGs.</description>

      <title>Towards AI-$45^{\circ}$ Law: A Roadmap to Trustworthy AGI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) reliably avoids harmful behaviors is a critical challenge, especially for systems with high autonomy or in safety-critical domains. Despite various safety assurance proposals and extreme risk warnings, comprehensive guidelines balancing AI safety and capability remain lacking. In this position paper, we propose the \textit{AI-\textbf{$45^{\circ}$} Law} as a guiding principle for a balanced roadmap toward trustworthy AGI, and introduce the \textit{Causal Ladder of Trustworthy AGI} as a practical framework. This framework provides a systematic taxonomy and hierarchical structure for current AI capability and safety research, inspired by Judea Pearl's ``Ladder of Causation''. The Causal Ladder comprises three core layers: the Approximate Alignment Layer, the Intervenable Layer, and the Reflectable Layer. These layers address the key challenges of safety and trustworthiness in AGI and contemporary AI systems. Building upon this framework, we define five levels of trustworthy AGI: perception, reasoning, decision-making, autonomy, and collaboration trustworthiness. These levels represent distinct yet progressive aspects of trustworthy AGI. Finally, we present a series of potential governance measures to support the development of trustworthy AGI.\footnote{In this paper, trustworthiness is generally considered a broad form of safety, and no explicit distinction is made between the two. However, in some contexts, safety and trustworthiness are treated as distinct: safety involves assurance of correct behavior, while trustworthiness refers to user confidence in the system's decision-making. In such cases, different terms or both may be used depending on the context.</description>

      <title>Detecting Dark Patterns in User Interfaces Using Logistic Regression and Bag-of-Words Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14187</link>

Abstract: Dark patterns in user interfaces represent deceptive design practices intended to manipulate users' behavior, often leading to unintended consequences such as coerced purchases, involuntary data disclosures, or user frustration. Detecting and mitigating these dark patterns is crucial for promoting transparency, trust, and ethical design practices in digital environments. This paper proposes a novel approach for detecting dark patterns in user interfaces using logistic regression and bag-of-words representation. Our methodology involves collecting a diverse dataset of user interface text samples, preprocessing the data, extracting text features using the bag-of-words representation, training a logistic regression model, and evaluating its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurately identifying instances of dark patterns, with high predictive performance and robustness to variations in dataset composition and model parameters. The insights gained from this study contribute to the growing body of knowledge on dark patterns detection and classification, offering practical implications for designers, developers, and policymakers in promoting ethical design practices and protecting user rights in digital environments.</description>

      <title>Advancing Vehicle Plate Recognition: Multitasking Visual Language Models with VehiclePaliGemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: License plate recognition (LPR) involves automated systems that utilize cameras and computer vision to read vehicle license plates. Such plates collected through LPR can then be compared against databases to identify stolen vehicles, uninsured drivers, crime suspects, and more. The LPR system plays a significant role in saving time for institutions such as the police force. In the past, LPR relied heavily on Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which has been widely explored to recognize characters in images. Usually, collected plate images suffer from various limitations, including noise, blurring, weather conditions, and close characters, making the recognition complex. Existing LPR methods still require significant improvement, especially for distorted images. To fill this gap, we propose utilizing visual language models (VLMs) such as OpenAI GPT4o, Google Gemini 1.5, Google PaliGemma (Pathways Language and Image model + Gemma model), Meta Llama 3.2, Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet, LLaVA, NVIDIA VILA, and moondream2 to recognize such unclear plates with close characters. This paper evaluates the VLM's capability to address the aforementioned problems. Additionally, we introduce ``VehiclePaliGemma'', a fine-tuned Open-sourced PaliGemma VLM designed to recognize plates under challenging conditions. We compared our proposed VehiclePaliGemma with state-of-the-art methods and other VLMs using a dataset of Malaysian license plates collected under complex conditions. The results indicate that VehiclePaliGemma achieved superior performance with an accuracy of 87.6\%. Moreover, it is able to predict the car's plate at a speed of 7 frames per second using A100-80GB GPU. Finally, we explored the multitasking capability of VehiclePaliGemma model to accurately identify plates containing multiple cars of various models and colors, with plates positioned and oriented in different directions.</description>

      <title>Improving Generalization Performance of YOLOv8 for Camera Trap Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Camera traps have become integral tools in wildlife conservation, providing non-intrusive means to monitor and study wildlife in their natural habitats. The utilization of object detection algorithms to automate species identification from Camera Trap images is of huge importance for research and conservation purposes. However, the generalization issue, where the trained model is unable to apply its learnings to a never-before-seen dataset, is prevalent. This thesis explores the enhancements made to the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm to address the problem of generalization. The study delves into the limitations of the baseline YOLOv8 model, emphasizing its struggles with generalization in real-world environments. To overcome these limitations, enhancements are proposed, including the incorporation of a Global Attention Mechanism (GAM) module, modified multi-scale feature fusion, and Wise Intersection over Union (WIoUv3) as a bounding box regression loss function. A thorough evaluation and ablation experiments reveal the improved model's ability to suppress the background noise, focus on object properties, and exhibit robust generalization in novel environments. The proposed enhancements not only address the challenges inherent in camera trap datasets but also pave the way for broader applicability in real-world conservation scenarios, ultimately aiding in the effective management of wildlife populations and habitats.</description>

      <title>Syzygy: Dual Code-Test C to (safe) Rust Translation using LLMs and Dynamic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive usage in high-performance, low-level systems programming applications, C is susceptible to vulnerabilities due to manual memory management and unsafe pointer operations. Rust, a modern systems programming language, offers a compelling alternative. Its unique ownership model and type system ensure memory safety without sacrificing performance.
  In this paper, we present Syzygy, an automated approach to translate C to safe Rust. Our technique uses a synergistic combination of LLM-driven code and test translation guided by dynamic-analysis-generated execution information. This paired translation runs incrementally in a loop over the program in dependency order of the code elements while maintaining per-step correctness. Our approach exposes novel insights on combining the strengths of LLMs and dynamic analysis in the context of scaling and combining code generation with testing. We apply our approach to successfully translate Zopfli, a high-performance compression library with ~3000 lines of code and 98 functions. We validate the translation by testing equivalence with the source C program on a set of inputs. To our knowledge, this is the largest automated and test-validated C to safe Rust code translation achieved so far.</description>

      <title>Split Learning in Computer Vision for Semantic Segmentation Delay Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach to minimize the inference delay in semantic segmentation using split learning (SL), tailored to the needs of real-time computer vision (CV) applications for resource-constrained devices. Semantic segmentation is essential for applications such as autonomous vehicles and smart city infrastructure, but faces significant latency challenges due to high computational and communication loads. Traditional centralized processing methods are inefficient for such scenarios, often resulting in unacceptable inference delays. SL offers a promising alternative by partitioning deep neural networks (DNNs) between edge devices and a central server, enabling localized data processing and reducing the amount of data required for transmission. Our contribution includes the joint optimization of bandwidth allocation, cut layer selection of the edge devices' DNN, and the central server's processing resource allocation. We investigate both parallel and serial data processing scenarios and propose low-complexity heuristic solutions that maintain near-optimal performance while reducing computational requirements. Numerical results show that our approach effectively reduces inference delay, demonstrating the potential of SL for improving real-time CV applications in dynamic, resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Projected gradient methods for nonconvex and stochastic optimization: new complexities and auto-conditioned stepsizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel class of projected gradient (PG) methods for minimizing a smooth but not necessarily convex function over a convex compact set. We first provide a novel analysis of the "vanilla" PG method, achieving the best-known iteration complexity for finding an approximate stationary point of the problem. We then develop an "auto-conditioned" projected gradient (AC-PG) variant that achieves the same iteration complexity without requiring the input of the Lipschitz constant of the gradient or any line search procedure. The key idea is to estimate the Lipschitz constant using first-order information gathered from the previous iterations, and to show that the error caused by underestimating the Lipschitz constant can be properly controlled. We then generalize the PG methods to the stochastic setting, by proposing a stochastic projected gradient (SPG) method and a variance-reduced stochastic gradient (VR-SPG) method, achieving new complexity bounds in different oracle settings. We also present auto-conditioned stepsize policies for both stochastic PG methods and establish comparable convergence guarantees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel block for video modelling. It relies on a time-space-channel factorisation with dedicated blocks for each dimension: gated linear recurrent units (LRUs) perform information mixing over time, self-attention layers perform mixing over space, and MLPs over channels. The resulting architecture TRecViT performs well on sparse and dense tasks, trained in supervised or self-supervised regimes. Notably, our model is causal and outperforms or is on par with a pure attention model ViViT-L on large scale video datasets (SSv2, Kinetics400), while having $3\times$ less parameters, $12\times$ smaller memory footprint, and $5\times$ lower FLOPs count. Code and checkpoints will be made available online at https://github.com/google-deepmind/trecvit.</description>

      <title>Temporally Consistent Object-Centric Learning by Contrasting Slots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised object-centric learning from videos is a promising approach to extract structured representations from large, unlabeled collections of videos. To support downstream tasks like autonomous control, these representations must be both compositional and temporally consistent. Existing approaches based on recurrent processing often lack long-term stability across frames because their training objective does not enforce temporal consistency. In this work, we introduce a novel object-level temporal contrastive loss for video object-centric models that explicitly promotes temporal consistency. Our method significantly improves the temporal consistency of the learned object-centric representations, yielding more reliable video decompositions that facilitate challenging downstream tasks such as unsupervised object dynamics prediction. Furthermore, the inductive bias added by our loss strongly improves object discovery, leading to state-of-the-art results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming even weakly-supervised methods that leverage motion masks as additional cues.</description>

      <title>What Has Been Overlooked in Contrastive Source-Free Domain Adaptation: Leveraging Source-Informed Latent Augmentation within Neighborhood Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) involves adapting a model originally trained using a labeled dataset ({\em source domain}) to perform effectively on an unlabeled dataset ({\em target domain}) without relying on any source data during adaptation. This adaptation is especially crucial when significant disparities in data distributions exist between the two domains and when there are privacy concerns regarding the source model's training data. The absence of access to source data during adaptation makes it challenging to analytically estimate the domain gap. To tackle this issue, various techniques have been proposed, such as unsupervised clustering, contrastive learning, and continual learning. In this paper, we first conduct an extensive theoretical analysis of SFDA based on contrastive learning, primarily because it has demonstrated superior performance compared to other techniques. Motivated by the obtained insights, we then introduce a straightforward yet highly effective latent augmentation method tailored for contrastive SFDA. This augmentation method leverages the dispersion of latent features within the neighborhood of the query sample, guided by the source pre-trained model, to enhance the informativeness of positive keys. Our approach, based on a single InfoNCE-based contrastive loss, outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods on widely recognized benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Closing the Gap: A User Study on the Real-world Usefulness of AI-powered Vulnerability Detection &amp; Repair in the IDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first empirical study of a vulnerability detection and fix tool with professional software developers on real projects that they own. We implemented DeepVulGuard, an IDE-integrated tool based on state-of-the-art detection and fix models, and show that it has promising performance on benchmarks of historic vulnerability data. DeepVulGuard scans code for vulnerabilities (including identifying the vulnerability type and vulnerable region of code), suggests fixes, provides natural-language explanations for alerts and fixes, leveraging chat interfaces. We recruited 17 professional software developers at Microsoft, observed their usage of the tool on their code, and conducted interviews to assess the tool's usefulness, speed, trust, relevance, and workflow integration. We also gathered detailed qualitative feedback on users' perceptions and their desired features. Study participants scanned a total of 24 projects, 6.9k files, and over 1.7 million lines of source code, and generated 170 alerts and 50 fix suggestions. We find that although state-of-the-art AI-powered detection and fix tools show promise, they are not yet practical for real-world use due to a high rate of false positives and non-applicable fixes. User feedback reveals several actionable pain points, ranging from incomplete context to lack of customization for the user's codebase. Additionally, we explore how AI features, including confidence scores, explanations, and chat interaction, can apply to vulnerability detection and fixing. Based on these insights, we offer practical recommendations for evaluating and deploying AI detection and fix models. Our code and data are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.26367139.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning from Automatic Feedback for High-Quality Unit Test Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software testing is a crucial but time-consuming aspect of software development, and recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity for automated test case generation. However, because LLMs are trained on vast amounts of open-source code, they often generate test cases that do not adhere to best practices and may even contain test smells (anti-patterns). To address this issue, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Static Quality Metrics (RLSQM), wherein we utilize Reinforcement Learning to generate high-quality unit tests based on static analysis-based quality metrics. First, we analyzed LLM-generated tests and show that LLMs frequently do generate undesirable test smells -- up to 37% of the time. Then, we implemented lightweight static analysis-based reward model and trained LLMs using this reward model to optimize for five code quality metrics. Our experimental results demonstrate that the RL-optimized Codex model consistently generated higher-quality test cases than the base LLM, improving quality metrics by up to 23%, and generated nearly 100% syntactically-correct code. RLSQM also outperformed GPT-4 on all code quality metrics, in spite of training a substantially cheaper Codex model. We provide insights into how reliably utilize RL to improve test generation quality and show that RLSQM is a significant step towards enhancing the overall efficiency and reliability of automated software testing. Our data are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25983166.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of Spectral Algorithms for Semirandom Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a graph bisection problem, we are given a graph $G$ with two equally-sized unlabeled communities, and the goal is to recover the vertices in these communities. A popular heuristic, known as spectral clustering, is to output an estimated community assignment based on the eigenvector corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian of $G$. Spectral algorithms can be shown to provably recover the cluster structure for graphs generated from certain probabilistic models, such as the Stochastic Block Model (SBM). However, spectral clustering is known to be non-robust to model mis-specification. Techniques based on semidefinite programming have been shown to be more robust, but they incur significant computational overheads.
  In this work, we study the robustness of spectral algorithms against semirandom adversaries. Informally, a semirandom adversary is allowed to ``helpfully'' change the specification of the model in a way that is consistent with the ground-truth solution. Our semirandom adversaries in particular are allowed to add edges inside clusters or increase the probability that an edge appears inside a cluster. Semirandom adversaries are a useful tool to determine the extent to which an algorithm has overfit to statistical assumptions on the input.
  On the positive side, we identify classes of semirandom adversaries under which spectral bisection using the _unnormalized_ Laplacian is strongly consistent, i.e., it exactly recovers the planted partitioning. On the negative side, we show that in these classes spectral bisection with the _normalized_ Laplacian outputs a partitioning that makes a classification mistake on a constant fraction of the vertices. Finally, we demonstrate numerical experiments that complement our theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement learning has shown to be a powerful tool for developing policies in environments where an optimal solution is unclear. In this paper, we attempt to apply Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients to train a neural network to act as a velocity controller for a quadcopter. The quadcopter's objective is to quickly fly through a gate while avoiding crashing into the gate. We transfer our trained policy to the real world by deploying it on a quadcopter in a laboratory environment. Finally, we demonstrate that the trained policy is able to navigate the drone to the gate in the real world.</description>

      <title>SEREP: Semantic Facial Expression Representation for Robust In-the-Wild Capture and Retargeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monocular facial performance capture in-the-wild is challenging due to varied capture conditions, face shapes, and expressions. Most current methods rely on linear 3D Morphable Models, which represent facial expressions independently of identity at the vertex displacement level. We propose SEREP (Semantic Expression Representation), a model that disentangles expression from identity at the semantic level. It first learns an expression representation from unpaired 3D facial expressions using a cycle consistency loss. Then we train a model to predict expression from monocular images using a novel semi-supervised scheme that relies on domain adaptation. In addition, we introduce MultiREX, a benchmark addressing the lack of evaluation resources for the expression capture task. Our experiments show that SEREP outperforms state-of-the-art methods, capturing challenging expressions and transferring them to novel identities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present JaxPP, a system for efficiently scaling the training of large deep learning models with flexible pipeline parallelism. We introduce a seamless programming model that allows implementing user-defined pipeline schedules for gradient accumulation. JaxPP automatically distributes tasks, corresponding to pipeline stages, over a cluster of nodes and automatically infers the communication among them. We implement a MPMD runtime for asynchronous execution of SPMD tasks. The pipeline parallelism implementation of JaxPP improves hardware utilization by up to $1.11\times$ with respect to the best performing SPMD configuration.</description>

      <title>Balans: Multi-Armed Bandits-based Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search for Mixed-Integer Programming Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) is a powerful paradigm for modeling and solving various important combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, learning-based approaches have shown potential to speed up MIP solving via offline training that then guides important design decisions during search. However, a significant drawback of these methods is their heavy reliance on offline training, which requires collecting training datasets and computationally costly training epochs yet offering only limited generalization to unseen (larger) instances. In this paper, we propose Balans, an adaptive meta-solver for MIPs with online learning capability that does not require any supervision or apriori training. At its core, Balans is based on adaptive large-neighborhood search, operating on top of a MIP solver by successive applications of destroy and repair neighborhood operators. During the search, the selection among different neighborhood definitions is guided on the fly for the instance at hand via multi-armed bandit algorithms. Our extensive experiments on hard optimization instances show that Balans offers significant performance gains over the default MIP solver, is better than committing to any single best neighborhood, and improves over the state-of-the-art large-neighborhood search for MIPs. Finally, we release Balans as a highly configurable, MIP solver agnostic, open-source software.</description>

      <title>Nemesis: Noise-randomized Encryption with Modular Efficiency and Secure Integration in Machine Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems that guarantee security and privacy often rely on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) as a cornerstone technique, enabling computations on encrypted data without exposing sensitive information. However, a critical limitation of FHE is its computational inefficiency, making it impractical for large-scale applications. In this work, we propose \textit{Nemesis}, a framework that accelerates FHE-based systems without compromising accuracy or security. The design of Nemesis is inspired by Rache (SIGMOD'23), which introduced a caching mechanism for encrypted integers and scalars. Nemesis extends this idea with more advanced caching techniques and mathematical tools, enabling efficient operations over multi-slot FHE schemes and overcoming Rache's limitations to support general plaintext structures. We formally prove the security of Nemesis under standard cryptographic assumptions and evaluate its performance extensively on widely used datasets, including MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10. Experimental results show that Nemesis significantly reduces the computational overhead of FHE-based ML systems, paving the way for broader adoption of privacy-preserving technologies.</description>

      <title>Fingerprinting Codes Meet Geometry: Improved Lower Bounds for Private Query Release and Adaptive Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fingerprinting codes are a crucial tool for proving lower bounds in differential privacy. They have been used to prove tight lower bounds for several fundamental questions, especially in the ``low accuracy'' regime. Unlike reconstruction/discrepancy approaches however, they are more suited for query sets that arise naturally from the fingerprinting codes construction. In this work, we propose a general framework for proving fingerprinting type lower bounds, that allows us to tailor the technique to the geometry of the query set. Our approach allows us to prove several new results, including the following.
  First, we show that any (sample- and population-)accurate algorithm for answering $Q$ arbitrary adaptive counting queries over a universe $\mathcal{X}$ to accuracy $\alpha$ needs $\Omega(\frac{\sqrt{\log |\mathcal{X}|}\cdot \log Q}{\alpha^3})$ samples, matching known upper bounds. This shows that the approaches based on differential privacy are optimal for this question, and improves significantly on the previously known lower bounds of $\frac{\log Q}{\alpha^2}$ and $\min(\sqrt{Q}, \sqrt{\log |\mathcal{X}|})/\alpha^2$.
  Second, we show that any $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP algorithm for answering $Q$ counting queries to accuracy $\alpha$ needs $\Omega(\frac{\sqrt{ \log|\mathcal{X}| \log(1/\delta)} \log Q}{\varepsilon\alpha^2})$ samples, matching known upper bounds up to constants. Our framework allows for proving this bound via a direct correlation analysis and improves the prior bound of [BUV'14] by $\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}$.
  Third, we characterize the sample complexity of answering a set of random $0$-$1$ queries under approximate differential privacy. We give new upper and lower bounds in different regimes. By combining them with known results, we can complete the whole picture.</description>

      <title>Multi-task Representation Learning for Mixed Integer Linear Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) are highly flexible and powerful tools for modeling and solving complex real-world combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, machine learning (ML)-guided approaches have demonstrated significant potential in improving MILP-solving efficiency. However, these methods typically rely on separate offline data collection and training processes, which limits their scalability and adaptability. This paper introduces the first multi-task learning framework for ML-guided MILP solving. The proposed framework provides MILP embeddings helpful in guiding MILP solving across solvers (e.g., Gurobi and SCIP) and across tasks (e.g., Branching and Solver configuration). Through extensive experiments on three widely used MILP benchmarks, we demonstrate that our multi-task learning model performs similarly to specialized models within the same distribution. Moreover, it significantly outperforms them in generalization across problem sizes and tasks.</description>

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in photo-realistic scene reconstruction over recent years. Various disparate efforts have enabled capabilities such as multi-appearance or large-scale modeling; however, there lacks a welldesigned dataset that can evaluate the holistic progress of scene reconstruction. We introduce a collection of imagery of the Johns Hopkins Homewood Campus, acquired at different seasons, times of day, in multiple elevations, and across a large scale. We perform a multi-stage calibration process, which efficiently recover camera parameters from phone and drone cameras. This dataset can enable researchers to rigorously explore challenges in unconstrained settings, including effects of inconsistent illumination, reconstruction from large scale and from significantly different perspectives, etc.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Diffusion Models for High-Quality Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report presents the comprehensive implementation, evaluation, and optimization of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIMs), which are state-of-the-art generative models. During inference, these models take random noise as input and iteratively generate high-quality images as output. The study focuses on enhancing their generative capabilities by incorporating advanced techniques such as Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), Latent Diffusion Models with Variational Autoencoders (VAE), and alternative noise scheduling strategies. The motivation behind this work is the growing demand for efficient and scalable generative AI models that can produce realistic images across diverse datasets, addressing challenges in applications such as art creation, image synthesis, and data augmentation. Evaluations were conducted on datasets including CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100, with a focus on improving inference speed, computational efficiency, and image quality metrics like Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Results demonstrate that DDIM + CFG achieves faster inference and superior image quality. Challenges with VAE and noise scheduling are also highlighted, suggesting opportunities for future optimization. This work lays the groundwork for developing scalable, efficient, and high-quality generative AI systems to benefit industries ranging from entertainment to robotics.</description>

      <title>FedPIA -- Permuting and Integrating Adapters leveraging Wasserstein Barycenters for Finetuning Foundation Models in Multi-Modal Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models typically require large text and image datasets for effective fine-tuning. However, collecting data from various sites, especially in healthcare, is challenging due to strict privacy regulations. An alternative is to fine-tune these models on end-user devices, such as in medical clinics, without sending data to a server. These local clients typically have limited computing power and small datasets, which are not enough for fully fine-tuning large VLMs on their own. A naive solution to these scenarios is to leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies and apply federated learning (FL) algorithms to combine the learned adapter weights, thereby respecting the resource limitations and data privacy. However, this approach does not fully leverage the knowledge from multiple adapters trained on diverse data distributions and for diverse tasks. The adapters are adversely impacted by data heterogeneity and task heterogeneity across clients resulting in suboptimal convergence. To this end, we propose a novel framework called FedPIA that improves upon the naive combinations of FL and PEFT by introducing Permutation and Integration of the local Adapters in the server and global Adapters in the clients exploiting Wasserstein barycenters for improved blending of client-specific and client-agnostic knowledge. This layerwise permutation helps to bridge the gap in the parameter space of local and global adapters before integration. We conduct over 2000 client-level experiments utilizing 48 medical image datasets across five different medical vision-language FL task settings encompassing visual question answering as well as image and report-based multi-label disease detection. Our experiments involving diverse client settings, ten different modalities, and two VLM backbones demonstrate that FedPIA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art PEFT-FL baselines.</description>

      <title>WildSAT: Learning Satellite Image Representations from Wildlife Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What does the presence of a species reveal about a geographic location? We posit that habitat, climate, and environmental preferences reflected in species distributions provide a rich source of supervision for learning satellite image representations. We introduce WildSAT, which pairs satellite images with millions of geo-tagged wildlife observations readily-available on citizen science platforms. WildSAT uses a contrastive learning framework to combine information from species distribution maps with text descriptions that capture habitat and range details, alongside satellite images, to train or fine-tune models. On a range of downstream satellite image recognition tasks, this significantly improves the performance of both randomly initialized models and pre-trained models from sources like ImageNet or specialized satellite image datasets. Additionally, the alignment with text enables zero-shot retrieval, allowing for search based on general descriptions of locations. We demonstrate that WildSAT achieves better representations than recent methods that utilize other forms of cross-modal supervision, such as aligning satellite images with ground images or wildlife photos. Finally, we analyze the impact of various design choices on downstream performance, highlighting the general applicability of our approach.</description>

      <title>GenHMR: Generative Human Mesh Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial in many computer vision applications; from health to arts and entertainment. HMR from monocular images has predominantly been addressed by deterministic methods that output a single prediction for a given 2D image. However, HMR from a single image is an ill-posed problem due to depth ambiguity and occlusions. Probabilistic methods have attempted to address this by generating and fusing multiple plausible 3D reconstructions, but their performance has often lagged behind deterministic approaches. In this paper, we introduce GenHMR, a novel generative framework that reformulates monocular HMR as an image-conditioned generative task, explicitly modeling and mitigating uncertainties in the 2D-to-3D mapping process. GenHMR comprises two key components: (1) a pose tokenizer to convert 3D human poses into a sequence of discrete tokens in a latent space, and (2) an image-conditional masked transformer to learn the probabilistic distributions of the pose tokens, conditioned on the input image prompt along with randomly masked token sequence. During inference, the model samples from the learned conditional distribution to iteratively decode high-confidence pose tokens, thereby reducing 3D reconstruction uncertainties. To further refine the reconstruction, a 2D pose-guided refinement technique is proposed to directly fine-tune the decoded pose tokens in the latent space, which forces the projected 3D body mesh to align with the 2D pose clues. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GenHMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>VLM-AD: End-to-End Autonomous Driving through Vision-Language Model Supervision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human drivers rely on commonsense reasoning to navigate diverse and dynamic real-world scenarios. Existing end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving (AD) models are typically optimized to mimic driving patterns observed in data, without capturing the underlying reasoning processes. This limitation constrains their ability to handle challenging driving scenarios. To close this gap, we propose VLM-AD, a method that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) as teachers to enhance training by providing additional supervision that incorporates unstructured reasoning information and structured action labels. Such supervision enhances the model's ability to learn richer feature representations that capture the rationale behind driving patterns. Importantly, our method does not require a VLM during inference, making it practical for real-time deployment. When integrated with state-of-the-art methods, VLM-AD achieves significant improvements in planning accuracy and reduced collision rates on the nuScenes dataset.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Latent Diffusion Model for Complex Sewing Pattern Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating sewing patterns in garment design is receiving increasing attention due to its CG-friendly and flexible-editing nature. Previous sewing pattern generation methods have been able to produce exquisite clothing, but struggle to design complex garments with detailed control. To address these issues, we propose SewingLDM, a multi-modal generative model that generates sewing patterns controlled by text prompts, body shapes, and garment sketches. Initially, we extend the original vector of sewing patterns into a more comprehensive representation to cover more intricate details and then compress them into a compact latent space. To learn the sewing pattern distribution in the latent space, we design a two-step training strategy to inject the multi-modal conditions, \ie, body shapes, text prompts, and garment sketches, into a diffusion model, ensuring the generated garments are body-suited and detail-controlled. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed method, significantly surpassing previous approaches in terms of complex garment design and various body adaptability.

      <title>GraphEQA: Using 3D Semantic Scene Graphs for Real-time Embodied Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Embodied Question Answering (EQA), agents must explore and develop a semantic understanding of an unseen environment in order to answer a situated question with confidence. This remains a challenging problem in robotics, due to the difficulties in obtaining useful semantic representations, updating these representations online, and leveraging prior world knowledge for efficient exploration and planning. Aiming to address these limitations, we propose GraphEQA, a novel approach that utilizes real-time 3D metric-semantic scene graphs (3DSGs) and task relevant images as multi-modal memory for grounding Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to perform EQA tasks in unseen environments. We employ a hierarchical planning approach that exploits the hierarchical nature of 3DSGs for structured planning and semantic-guided exploration. Through experiments in simulation on the HM-EQA dataset and in the real world in home and office environments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms key baselines by completing EQA tasks with higher success rates and fewer planning steps.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider an unconstrained stochastic optimization problem where the objective function exhibits a high order of smoothness. In particular, we propose a stochastic first-order method (SFOM) with multi-extrapolated momentum, in which multiple extrapolations are performed in each iteration, followed by a momentum step based on these extrapolations. We show that our proposed SFOM with multi-extrapolated momentum can accelerate optimization by exploiting the high-order smoothness of the objective function $f$. Specifically, assuming that the gradient and the $p$th-order derivative of $f$ are Lipschitz continuous for some $p\ge2$, and under some additional mild assumptions, we establish that our method achieves a sample complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-(3p+1)/p})$ for finding a point $x$ satisfying $\mathbb{E}[\|\nabla f(x)\|]\le\epsilon$. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first SFOM to leverage arbitrary order smoothness of the objective function for acceleration, resulting in a sample complexity that strictly improves upon the best-known results without assuming the average smoothness condition. Finally, preliminary numerical experiments validate the practical performance of our method and corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>MAIDS: Malicious Agent Identification-based Data Security Model for Cloud Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the vigorous development of cloud computing, most organizations have shifted their data and applications to the cloud environment for storage, computation, and sharing purposes. During storage and data sharing across the participating entities, a malicious agent may gain access to outsourced data from the cloud environment. A malicious agent is an entity that deliberately breaches the data. This information accessed might be misused or revealed to unauthorized parties. Therefore, data protection and prediction of malicious agents have become a demanding task that needs to be addressed appropriately. To deal with this crucial and challenging issue, this paper presents a Malicious Agent Identification-based Data Security (MAIDS) Model which utilizes XGBoost machine learning classification algorithm for securing data allocation and communication among different participating entities in the cloud system. The proposed model explores and computes intended multiple security parameters associated with online data communication or transactions. Correspondingly, a security-focused knowledge database is produced for developing the XGBoost Classifier-based Malicious Agent Prediction (XC-MAP) unit. Unlike the existing approaches, which only identify malicious agents after data leaks, MAIDS proactively identifies malicious agents by examining their eligibility for respective data access. In this way, the model provides a comprehensive solution to safeguard crucial data from both intentional and non-intentional breaches, by granting data to authorized agents only by evaluating the agents behavior and predicting the malicious agent before granting data.</description>

      <title>FaultExplainer: Leveraging Large Language Models for Interpretable Fault Detection and Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly being applied to fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) in chemical processes. However, existing data-driven FDD platforms often lack interpretability for process operators and struggle to identify root causes of previously unseen faults. This paper presents FaultExplainer, an interactive tool designed to improve fault detection, diagnosis, and explanation in the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). FaultExplainer integrates real-time sensor data visualization, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based fault detection, and identification of top contributing variables within an interactive user interface powered by large language models (LLMs). We evaluate the LLMs' reasoning capabilities in two scenarios: one where historical root causes are provided, and one where they are not to mimic the challenge of previously unseen faults. Experimental results using GPT-4o and o1-preview models demonstrate the system's strengths in generating plausible and actionable explanations, while also highlighting its limitations, including reliance on PCA-selected features and occasional hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Guided Diffusion Model for Sensor Data Obfuscation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensor data collected by Internet of Things (IoT) devices carries detailed information about individuals in their vicinity. Sharing this data with a semi-trusted service provider may compromise the individuals' privacy, as sensitive information can be extracted by powerful machine learning models. Data obfuscation empowered by generative models is a promising approach to generate synthetic sensor data such that the useful information contained in the original data is preserved and the sensitive information is obscured. This newly generated data will then be shared with the service provider instead of the original sensor data. In this work, we propose PrivDiffuser, a novel data obfuscation technique based on a denoising diffusion model that attains a superior trade-off between data utility and privacy through effective guidance techniques. Specifically, we extract latent representations that contain information about public and private attributes from sensor data to guide the diffusion model, and impose mutual information-based regularization when learning the latent representations to alleviate the entanglement of public and private attributes, thereby increasing the effectiveness of guidance. Evaluation on three real-world datasets containing different sensing modalities reveals that PrivDiffuser yields a better privacy-utility trade-off than the state-of-the-art obfuscation model, decreasing the utility loss by up to $1.81\%$ and the privacy loss by up to $3.42\%$. Moreover, we showed that users with diverse privacy needs can use PrivDiffuser to protect their privacy without having to retrain the model.</description>

      <title>Dynamic User Interface Generation for Enhanced Human-Computer Interaction Using Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel approach for intelligent user interaction interface generation and optimization, grounded in the variational autoencoder (VAE) model. With the rapid advancement of intelligent technologies, traditional interface design methods struggle to meet the evolving demands for diversity and personalization, often lacking flexibility in real-time adjustments to enhance the user experience. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) plays a critical role in addressing these challenges by focusing on creating interfaces that are functional, intuitive, and responsive to user needs. This research leverages the RICO dataset to train the VAE model, enabling the simulation and creation of user interfaces that align with user aesthetics and interaction habits. By integrating real-time user behavior data, the system dynamically refines and optimizes the interface, improving usability and underscoring the importance of HCI in achieving a seamless user experience. Experimental findings indicate that the VAE-based approach significantly enhances the quality and precision of interface generation compared to other methods, including autoencoders (AE), generative adversarial networks (GAN), conditional GANs (cGAN), deep belief networks (DBN), and VAE-GAN. This work contributes valuable insights into HCI, providing robust technical solutions for automated interface generation and enhanced user experience optimization.</description>

Abstract: Class imbalance and distributional differences in large datasets present significant challenges for classification tasks machine learning, often leading to biased models and poor predictive performance for minority classes. This work introduces two novel undersampling approaches: mutual information-based stratified simple random sampling and support points optimization. These methods prioritize representative data selection, effectively minimizing information loss. Empirical results across multiple classification tasks demonstrate that our methods outperform traditional undersampling techniques, achieving higher balanced classification accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of combining statistical concepts with machine learning to address class imbalance in practical applications.</description>

Abstract: This study introduces a federated learning-based approach to predict HER2 status from hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images (WSIs), reducing costs and speeding up treatment decisions. To address label imbalance and feature representation challenges in multisite datasets, a point transformer is proposed, incorporating dynamic label distribution, an auxiliary classifier, and farthest cosine sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across four sites (2687 WSIs) and strong generalization to two unseen sites (229 WSIs).</description>

      <title>ScaMo: Exploring the Scaling Law in Autoregressive Motion Generation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scaling law has been validated in various domains, such as natural language processing (NLP) and massive computer vision tasks; however, its application to motion generation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a scalable motion generation framework that includes the motion tokenizer Motion FSQ-VAE and a text-prefix autoregressive transformer. Through comprehensive experiments, we observe the scaling behavior of this system. For the first time, we confirm the existence of scaling laws within the context of motion generation. Specifically, our results demonstrate that the normalized test loss of our prefix autoregressive models adheres to a logarithmic law in relation to compute budgets. Furthermore, we also confirm the power law between Non-Vocabulary Parameters, Vocabulary Parameters, and Data Tokens with respect to compute budgets respectively. Leveraging the scaling law, we predict the optimal transformer size, vocabulary size, and data requirements for a compute budget of $1e18$. The test loss of the system, when trained with the optimal model size, vocabulary size, and required data, aligns precisely with the predicted test loss, thereby validating the scaling law.</description>

      <title>GBRIP: Granular Ball Representation for Imbalanced Partial Label Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial label learning (PLL) is a complicated weakly supervised multi-classification task compounded by class imbalance. Currently, existing methods only rely on inter-class pseudo-labeling from inter-class features, often overlooking the significant impact of the intra-class imbalanced features combined with the inter-class. To address these limitations, we introduce Granular Ball Representation for Imbalanced PLL (GBRIP), a novel framework for imbalanced PLL. GBRIP utilizes coarse-grained granular ball representation and multi-center loss to construct a granular ball-based nfeature space through unsupervised learning, effectively capturing the feature distribution within each class. GBRIP mitigates the impact of confusing features by systematically refining label disambiguation and estimating imbalance distributions. The novel multi-center loss function enhances learning by emphasizing the relationships between samples and their respective centers within the granular balls. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that GBRIP outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, offering a robust solution to the challenges of imbalanced PLL.</description>

      <title>AIArena: A Blockchain-Based Decentralized AI Training Platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI has underscored critical challenges in its development and implementation, largely due to centralized control by a few major corporations. This concentration of power intensifies biases within AI models, resulting from inadequate governance and oversight mechanisms. Additionally, it limits public involvement and heightens concerns about the integrity of model generation. Such monopolistic control over data and AI outputs threatens both innovation and fair data usage, as users inadvertently contribute data that primarily benefits these corporations. In this work, we propose AIArena, a blockchain-based decentralized AI training platform designed to democratize AI development and alignment through on-chain incentive mechanisms. AIArena fosters an open and collaborative environment where participants can contribute models and computing resources. Its on-chain consensus mechanism ensures fair rewards for participants based on their contributions. We instantiate and implement AIArena on the public Base blockchain Sepolia testnet, and the evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility of AIArena in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Patient-Specific Calibration via Differentiable Hemodynamics Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the goals of personalized medicine is to tailor diagnostics to individual patients. Diagnostics are performed in practice by measuring quantities, called biomarkers, that indicate the existence and progress of a disease. In common cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, biomarkers that are closely related to the clinical representation of a patient can be predicted using computational models. Personalizing computational models translates to considering patient-specific flow conditions, for example, the compliance of blood vessels that cannot be a priori known and quantities such as the patient geometry that can be measured using imaging. Therefore, a patient is identified by a set of measurable and nonmeasurable parameters needed to well-define a computational model; else, the computational model is not personalized, meaning it is prone to large prediction errors. Therefore, to personalize a computational model, sufficient information needs to be extracted from the data. The current methods by which this is done are either inefficient, due to relying on slow-converging optimization methods, or hard to interpret, due to using `black box` deep-learning algorithms. We propose a personalized diagnostic procedure based on a differentiable 0D-1D Navier-Stokes reduced order model solver and fast parameter inference methods that take advantage of gradients through the solver. By providing a faster method for performing parameter inference and sensitivity analysis through differentiability while maintaining the interpretability of well-understood mathematical models and numerical methods, the best of both worlds is combined. The performance of the proposed solver is validated against a well-established process on different geometries, and different parameter inference processes are successfully performed.</description>

      <title>Multi-Sensor Object Anomaly Detection: Unifying Appearance, Geometry, and Internal Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object anomaly detection is essential for industrial quality inspection, yet traditional single-sensor methods face critical limitations. They fail to capture the wide range of anomaly types, as single sensors are often constrained to either external appearance, geometric structure, or internal properties. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MulSen-AD, the first high-resolution, multi-sensor anomaly detection dataset tailored for industrial applications. MulSen-AD unifies data from RGB cameras, laser scanners, and lock-in infrared thermography, effectively capturing external appearance, geometric deformations, and internal defects. The dataset spans 15 industrial products with diverse, real-world anomalies. We also present MulSen-AD Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate multi-sensor methods, and propose MulSen-TripleAD, a decision-level fusion algorithm that integrates these three modalities for robust, unsupervised object anomaly detection. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-sensor fusion substantially outperforms single-sensor approaches, achieving 96.1% AUROC in object-level detection accuracy. These results highlight the importance of integrating multi-sensor data for comprehensive industrial anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>LDP: Generalizing to Multilingual Visual Information Extraction by Language Decoupled Pretraining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Information Extraction (VIE) plays a crucial role in the comprehension of semi-structured documents, and several pre-trained models have been developed to enhance performance. However, most of these works are monolingual (usually English). Due to the extremely unbalanced quantity and quality of pre-training corpora between English and other languages, few works can extend to non-English scenarios. In this paper, we conduct systematic experiments to show that vision and layout modality hold invariance among images with different languages. If decoupling language bias from document images, a vision-layout-based model can achieve impressive cross-lingual generalization. Accordingly, we present a simple but effective multilingual training paradigm LDP (Language Decoupled Pre-training) for better utilization of monolingual pre-training data. Our proposed model LDM (Language Decoupled Model) is first pre-trained on the language-independent data, where the language knowledge is decoupled by a diffusion model, and then the LDM is fine-tuned on the downstream languages. Extensive experiments show that the LDM outperformed all SOTA multilingual pre-trained models, and also maintains competitiveness on downstream monolingual/English benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Fast inverse lithography based on a model-driven block stacking convolutional neural network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of lithography, Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) is a crucial resolution enhancement technique that optimizes the transmission function of photomasks on a pixel-based to effectively counter Optical Proximity Effects (OPE). However, conventional pixel-based OPC methods often generate patterns that pose manufacturing challenges, thereby leading to the increased cost in practical scenarios. This paper presents a novel inverse lithographic approach to OPC, employing a model-driven, block stacking deep learning framework that expedites the generation of masks conducive to manufacturing. This method is founded on vector lithography modelling and streamlines the training process by eliminating the requirement for extensive labeled datasets. Furthermore, diversity of mask patterns is enhanced by employing a wave function collapse algorithm, which facilitates the random generation of a multitude of target patterns, therefore significantly expanding the range of mask paradigm. Numerical experiments have substantiated the efficacy of the proposed end-to-end approach, highlighting its superior capability to manage mask complexity within the context of advanced OPC lithography. This advancement is anticipated to enhance the feasibility and economic viability of OPC technology within actual manufacturing environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological correctness, i.e., the preservation of structural integrity and specific characteristics of shape, is a fundamental requirement for medical imaging tasks, such as neuron or vessel segmentation. Despite the recent surge in topology-aware methods addressing this challenge, their real-world applicability is hindered by flawed benchmarking practices. In this paper, we identify critical pitfalls in model evaluation that include inadequate connectivity choices, overlooked topological artifacts in ground truth annotations, and inappropriate use of evaluation metrics. Through detailed empirical analysis, we uncover these issues' profound impact on the evaluation and ranking of segmentation methods. Drawing from our findings, we propose a set of actionable recommendations to establish fair and robust evaluation standards for topology-aware medical image segmentation methods.</description>

      <title>Qua$^2$SeDiMo: Quantifiable Quantization Sensitivity of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Models (DM) have democratized AI image generation through an iterative denoising process. Quantization is a major technique to alleviate the inference cost and reduce the size of DM denoiser networks. However, as denoisers evolve from variants of convolutional U-Nets toward newer Transformer architectures, it is of growing importance to understand the quantization sensitivity of different weight layers, operations and architecture types to performance. In this work, we address this challenge with Qua$^2$SeDiMo, a mixed-precision Post-Training Quantization framework that generates explainable insights on the cost-effectiveness of various model weight quantization methods for different denoiser operation types and block structures. We leverage these insights to make high-quality mixed-precision quantization decisions for a myriad of diffusion models ranging from foundational U-Nets to state-of-the-art Transformers. As a result, Qua$^2$SeDiMo can construct 3.4-bit, 3.9-bit, 3.65-bit and 3.7-bit weight quantization on PixArt-${\alpha}$, PixArt-${\Sigma}$, Hunyuan-DiT and SDXL, respectively. We further pair our weight-quantization configurations with 6-bit activation quantization and outperform existing approaches in terms of quantitative metrics and generative image quality.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Prompt Tuning: Vision Guided Prompt Tuning with Cross-Attention for Fine-Grained Few-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-shot, fine-grained classification in computer vision poses significant challenges due to the need to differentiate subtle class distinctions with limited data. This paper presents a novel method that enhances the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model through adaptive prompt tuning, guided by real-time visual inputs. Unlike existing techniques such as Context Optimization (CoOp) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT), which are constrained by static prompts or visual token reliance, the proposed approach leverages a cross-attention mechanism to dynamically refine text prompts for the image at hand. This enables an image-specific alignment of textual features with image patches extracted from the Vision Transformer, making the model more effective for datasets with high intra-class variance and low inter-class differences. The method is evaluated on several datasets, including CUBirds, Oxford Flowers, and FGVC Aircraft, showing significant performance gains over static prompt tuning approaches. To ensure these performance gains translate into trustworthy predictions, we integrate Monte-Carlo Dropout in our approach to improve the reliability of the model predictions and uncertainty estimates. This integration provides valuable insights into the model's predictive confidence, helping to identify when predictions can be trusted and when additional verification is necessary. This dynamic approach offers a robust solution, advancing the state-of-the-art for few-shot fine-grained classification.</description>

      <title>Permutation recovery of spikes in noisy high-dimensional tensor estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of gradient flow in high dimensions for the multi-spiked tensor problem, where the goal is to estimate $r$ unknown signal vectors (spikes) from noisy Gaussian tensor observations. Specifically, we analyze the maximum likelihood estimation procedure, which involves optimizing a highly nonconvex random function. We determine the sample complexity required for gradient flow to efficiently recover all spikes, without imposing any assumptions on the separation of the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). More precisely, our results provide the sample complexity required to guarantee recovery of the spikes up to a permutation. Our work builds on our companion paper [Ben Arous, Gerbelot, Piccolo 2024], which studies Langevin dynamics and determines the sample complexity and separation conditions for the SNRs necessary for ensuring exact recovery of the spikes (where the recovered permutation matches the identity). During the recovery process, the correlations between the estimators and the hidden vectors increase in a sequential manner. The order in which these correlations become significant depends on their initial values and the corresponding SNRs, which ultimately determines the permutation of the recovered spikes.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Uncertainty: A Deep Dive into Calibration and Performance of Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) combine visual and textual data for tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. Proper uncertainty calibration is crucial, yet challenging, for reliable use in areas like healthcare and autonomous driving. This paper investigates representative MLLMs, focusing on their calibration across various scenarios, including before and after visual fine-tuning, as well as before and after multimodal training of the base LLMs. We observed miscalibration in their performance, and at the same time, no significant differences in calibration across these scenarios. We also highlight how uncertainty differs between text and images and how their integration affects overall uncertainty. To better understand MLLMs' miscalibration and their ability to self-assess uncertainty, we construct the IDK (I don't know) dataset, which is key to evaluating how they handle unknowns. Our findings reveal that MLLMs tend to give answers rather than admit uncertainty, but this self-assessment improves with proper prompt adjustments. Finally, to calibrate MLLMs and enhance model reliability, we propose techniques such as temperature scaling and iterative prompt optimization. Our results provide insights into improving MLLMs for effective and responsible deployment in multimodal applications.

      <title>How to Synthesize Text Data without Model Collapse?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model collapse in synthetic data indicates that iterative training on self-generated data leads to a gradual decline in performance. With the proliferation of AI models, synthetic data will fundamentally reshape the web data ecosystem. Future GPT-$\{n\}$ models will inevitably be trained on a blend of synthetic and human-produced data. In this paper, we focus on two questions: what is the impact of synthetic data on language model training, and how to synthesize data without model collapse? We first pre-train language models across different proportions of synthetic data, revealing a negative correlation between the proportion of synthetic data and model performance. We further conduct statistical analysis on synthetic data to uncover distributional shift phenomenon and over-concentration of n-gram features. Inspired by the above findings, we propose token editing on human-produced data to obtain semi-synthetic data. As a proof of concept, we theoretically demonstrate that token-level editing can prevent model collapse, as the test error is constrained by a finite upper bound. We conduct extensive experiments on pre-training from scratch, continual pre-training, and supervised fine-tuning. The results validate our theoretical proof that token-level editing improves data quality and enhances model performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kubernetes offers a powerful orchestration platform for machine learning training, but memory management can be challenging due to specialized needs and resource constraints. This paper outlines how Kubernetes handles memory requests, limits, Quality of Service classes, and eviction policies for ML workloads, with special focus on GPU memory and ephemeral storage. Common pitfalls such as overcommitment, memory leaks, and ephemeral volume exhaustion are examined. We then provide best practices for stable, scalable memory utilization to help ML practitioners prevent out-of-memory events and ensure high-performance ML training pipelines.</description>

      <title>Prototypical Calibrating Ambiguous Samples for Micro-Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro-Action Recognition (MAR) has gained increasing attention due to its crucial role as a form of non-verbal communication in social interactions, with promising potential for applications in human communication and emotion analysis. However, current approaches often overlook the inherent ambiguity in micro-actions, which arises from the wide category range and subtle visual differences between categories. This oversight hampers the accuracy of micro-action recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel Prototypical Calibrating Ambiguous Network (\textbf{PCAN}) to unleash and mitigate the ambiguity of MAR. \textbf{Firstly}, we employ a hierarchical action-tree to identify the ambiguous sample, categorizing them into distinct sets of ambiguous samples of false negatives and false positives, considering both body- and action-level categories. \textbf{Secondly}, we implement an ambiguous contrastive refinement module to calibrate these ambiguous samples by regulating the distance between ambiguous samples and their corresponding prototypes. This calibration process aims to pull false negative ($\mathbb{FN}$) samples closer to their respective prototypes and push false positive ($\mathbb{FP}$) samples apart from their affiliated prototypes. In addition, we propose a new prototypical diversity amplification loss to strengthen the model's capacity by amplifying the differences between different prototypes. \textbf{Finally}, we propose a prototype-guided rectification to rectify prediction by incorporating the representability of prototypes. Extensive experiments conducted on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing approaches.

      <title>On the Use of Deep Learning Models for Semantic Clone Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting and tracking code clones can ease various software development and maintenance tasks when changes in a code fragment should be propagated over all its copies. Several deep learning-based clone detection models have appeared in the literature for detecting syntactic and semantic clones, widely evaluated with the BigCloneBench dataset. However, class imbalance and the small number of semantic clones make BigCloneBench less ideal for interpreting model performance. Researchers also use other datasets such as GoogleCodeJam, OJClone, and SemanticCloneBench to understand model generalizability. To overcome the limitations of existing datasets, the GPT-assisted semantic and cross-language clone dataset GPTCloneBench has been released. However, how these models compare across datasets remains unclear. In this paper, we propose a multi-step evaluation approach for five state-of-the-art clone detection models leveraging existing benchmark datasets, including GPTCloneBench, and using mutation operators to study model ability. Specifically, we examine three highly-performing single-language models (ASTNN, GMN, CodeBERT) on BigCloneBench, SemanticCloneBench, and GPTCloneBench, testing their robustness with mutation operations. Additionally, we compare them against cross-language models (C4, CLCDSA) known for detecting semantic clones. While single-language models show high F1 scores for BigCloneBench, their performance on SemanticCloneBench varies (up to 20%). Interestingly, the cross-language model (C4) shows superior performance (around 7%) on SemanticCloneBench over other models and performs similarly on BigCloneBench and GPTCloneBench. On mutation-based datasets, C4 has more robust performance (less than 1% difference) compared to single-language models, which show high variability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active Inference is a closed-loop computational theoretical basis for understanding behaviour, based on agents with internal probabilistic generative models that encode their beliefs about how hidden states in their environment cause their sensations. We review Active Inference and how it could be applied to model the human-computer interaction loop. Active Inference provides a coherent framework for managing generative models of humans, their environments, sensors and interface components. It informs off-line design and supports real-time, online adaptation. It provides model-based explanations for behaviours observed in HCI, and new tools to measure important concepts such as agency and engagement. We discuss how Active Inference offers a new basis for a theory of interaction in HCI, tools for design of modern, complex sensor-based systems, and integration of artificial intelligence technologies, enabling it to cope with diversity in human users and contexts. We discuss the practical challenges in implementing such Active Inference-based systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional calibration of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data relies on estimation of the sound horizon at drag epoch $r_d$ from early universe observations by assuming a cosmological model. We present a recalibration of two independent BAO datasets, SDSS and DESI, by employing deep learning techniques for model-independent estimation of $r_d$, and explore the impacts on $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters. Significant reductions in both Hubble ($H_0$) and clustering ($S_8$) tensions are observed for both the recalibrated datasets. Moderate shifts in some other parameters hint towards further exploration of such data-driven approaches.</description>

      <title>Opportunities and limitations of explaining quantum machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common trait of many machine learning models is that it is often difficult to understand and explain what caused the model to produce the given output. While the explainability of neural networks has been an active field of research in the last years, comparably little is known for quantum machine learning models. Despite a few recent works analyzing some specific aspects of explainability, as of now there is no clear big picture perspective as to what can be expected from quantum learning models in terms of explainability. In this work, we address this issue by identifying promising research avenues in this direction and lining out the expected future results. We additionally propose two explanation methods designed specifically for quantum machine learning models, as first of their kind to the best of our knowledge. Next to our pre-view of the field, we compare both existing and novel methods to explain the predictions of quantum learning models. By studying explainability in quantum machine learning, we can contribute to the sustainable development of the field, preventing trust issues in the future.</description>

      <title>ALKAFI-LLAMA3: Fine-Tuning LLMs for Precise Legal Understanding in Palestine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in diverse domains, yet their application in the legal sector, particularly in low-resource contexts, remains limited. This study addresses the challenges of adapting LLMs to the Palestinian legal domain, where political instability, fragmented legal frameworks, and limited AI resources hinder effective machine-learning applications. We present a fine-tuned model based on a quantized version of Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, trained on a synthetic data set derived from Palestinian legal texts. Using smaller-scale models and strategically generated question-answer pairs, we achieve a cost-effective, locally sustainable solution that provides accurate and contextually relevant legal guidance. Our experiments demonstrate promising performance on various query types, ranging from yes/no questions and narrative explanations to complex legal differentiations, while highlighting areas for improvement, such as handling calculation-based inquiries and structured list formatting. This work provides a pathway for the deployment of AI-driven legal assistance tools tailored to the needs of resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Agent-Temporal Credit Assignment for Optimal Policy Preservation in Sparse Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multi-agent environments, agents often struggle to learn optimal policies due to sparse or delayed global rewards, particularly in long-horizon tasks where it is challenging to evaluate actions at intermediate time steps. We introduce Temporal-Agent Reward Redistribution (TAR$^2$), a novel approach designed to address the agent-temporal credit assignment problem by redistributing sparse rewards both temporally and across agents. TAR$^2$ decomposes sparse global rewards into time-step-specific rewards and calculates agent-specific contributions to these rewards. We theoretically prove that TAR$^2$ is equivalent to potential-based reward shaping, ensuring that the optimal policy remains unchanged. Empirical results demonstrate that TAR$^2$ stabilizes and accelerates the learning process. Additionally, we show that when TAR$^2$ is integrated with single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, it performs as well as or better than traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning methods.</description>

      <title>Stack Trace Deduplication: Faster, More Accurately, and in More Realistic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In large-scale software systems, there are often no fully-fledged bug reports with human-written descriptions when an error occurs. In this case, developers rely on stack traces, i.e., series of function calls that led to the error. Since there can be tens and hundreds of thousands of them describing the same issue from different users, automatic deduplication into categories is necessary to allow for processing. Recent works have proposed powerful deep learning-based approaches for this, but they are evaluated and compared in isolation from real-life workflows, and it is not clear whether they will actually work well at scale.
  To overcome this gap, this work presents three main contributions: a novel model, an industry-based dataset, and a multi-faceted evaluation. Our model consists of two parts - (1) an embedding model with byte-pair encoding and approximate nearest neighbor search to quickly find the most relevant stack traces to the incoming one, and (2) a reranker that re-ranks the most fitting stack traces, taking into account the repeated frames between them. To complement the existing datasets collected from open-source projects, we share with the community SlowOps - a dataset of stack traces from IntelliJ-based products developed by JetBrains, which has an order of magnitude more stack traces per category. Finally, we carry out an evaluation that strives to be realistic: measuring not only the accuracy of categorization, but also the operation time and the ability to create new categories. The evaluation shows that our model strikes a good balance - it outperforms other models on both open-source datasets and SlowOps, while also being faster on time than most. We release all of our code and data, and hope that our work can pave the way to further practice-oriented research in the area.</description>

      <title>Answer Set Networks: Casting Answer Set Programming into Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although Answer Set Programming (ASP) allows constraining neural-symbolic (NeSy) systems, its employment is hindered by the prohibitive costs of computing stable models and the CPU-bound nature of state-of-the-art solvers. To this end, we propose Answer Set Networks (ASN), a NeSy solver. Based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN), ASNs are a scalable approach to ASP-based Deep Probabilistic Logic Programming (DPPL). Specifically, we show how to translate ASPs into ASNs and demonstrate how ASNs can efficiently solve the encoded problem by leveraging GPU's batching and parallelization capabilities. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that ASNs outperform state-of-the-art CPU-bound NeSy systems on multiple tasks. Simultaneously, we make the following two contributions based on the strengths of ASNs. Namely, we are the first to show the finetuning of Large Language Models (LLM) with DPPLs, employing ASNs to guide the training with logic. Further, we show the "constitutional navigation" of drones, i.e., encoding public aviation laws in an ASN for routing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>Surrogate-assisted multi-objective design of complex multibody systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimization of large-scale multibody systems is a numerically challenging task, in particular when considering multiple conflicting criteria at the same time. In this situation, we need to approximate the Pareto set of optimal compromises, which is significantly more expensive than finding a single optimum in single-objective optimization. To prevent large costs, the usage of surrogate models, constructed from a small but informative number of expensive model evaluations, is a very popular and widely studied approach. The central challenge then is to ensure a high quality (that is, near-optimality) of the solutions that were obtained using the surrogate model, which can be hard to guarantee with a single pre-computed surrogate. We present a back-and-forth approach between surrogate modeling and multi-objective optimization to improve the quality of the obtained solutions. Using the example of an expensive-to-evaluate multibody system, we compare different strategies regarding multi-objective optimization, sampling and also surrogate modeling, to identify the most promising approach in terms of computational efficiency and solution quality.</description>

      <title>AI-Powered Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection: A Co-Scale Convolutional Attention Model with Uncertainty-Based Fuzzy Integral Operator and Feature Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) refers to the leakage or accumulation of blood within the skull, which occurs due to the rupture of blood vessels in or around the brain. If this condition is not diagnosed in a timely manner and appropriately treated, it can lead to serious complications such as decreased consciousness, permanent neurological disabilities, or even death.The primary aim of this study is to detect the occurrence or non-occurrence of ICH, followed by determining the type of subdural hemorrhage (SDH). These tasks are framed as two separate binary classification problems. By adding two layers to the co-scale convolutional attention (CCA) classifier architecture, we introduce a novel approach for ICH detection. In the first layer, after extracting features from different slices of computed tomography (CT) scan images, we combine these features and select the 50 components that capture the highest variance in the data, considering them as informative features. We then assess the discriminative power of these features using the bootstrap forest algorithm, discarding those that lack sufficient discriminative ability between different classes. This algorithm explicitly determines the contribution of each feature to the final prediction, assisting us in developing an explainable AI model. The features feed into a boosting neural network as a latent feature space. In the second layer, we introduce a novel uncertainty-based fuzzy integral operator to fuse information from different CT scan slices. This operator, by accounting for the dependencies between consecutive slices, significantly improves detection accuracy.</description>

      <title>From Point to probabilistic gradient boosting for claim frequency and severity prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient boosting for decision tree algorithms are increasingly used in actuarial applications as they show superior predictive performance over traditional generalized linear models. Many improvements and sophistications to the first gradient boosting machine algorithm exist. We present in a unified notation, and contrast, all the existing point and probabilistic gradient boosting for decision tree algorithms: GBM, XGBoost, DART, LightGBM, CatBoost, EGBM, PGBM, XGBoostLSS, cyclic GBM, and NGBoost. In this comprehensive numerical study, we compare their performance on five publicly available datasets for claim frequency and severity, of various size and comprising different number of (high cardinality) categorical variables. We explain how varying exposure-to-risk can be handled with boosting in frequency models. We compare the algorithms on the basis of computational efficiency, predictive performance, and model adequacy. LightGBM and XGBoostLSS win in terms of computational efficiency. The fully interpretable EGBM achieves competitive predictive performance compared to the black box algorithms considered. We find that there is no trade-off between model adequacy and predictive accuracy: both are achievable simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Corn Ear Detection and Orientation Estimation Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring growth behavior of maize plants such as the development of ears can give key insights into the plant's health and development. Traditionally, the measurement of the angle of ears is performed manually, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. To address these challenges, this paper presents a computer vision-based system for detecting and tracking ears of corn in an image sequence. The proposed system could accurately detect, track, and predict the ear's orientation, which can be useful in monitoring their growth behavior. This can significantly save time compared to manual measurement and enables additional areas of ear orientation research and potential increase in efficiencies for maize production. Using an object detector with keypoint detection, the algorithm proposed could detect 90 percent of all ears. The cardinal estimation had a mean absolute error (MAE) of 18 degrees, compared to a mean 15 degree difference between two people measuring by hand. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using computer vision techniques for monitoring maize growth and can lead to further research in this area.</description>

      <title>IDOL: Instant Photorealistic 3D Human Creation from a Single Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating a high-fidelity, animatable 3D full-body avatar from a single image is a challenging task due to the diverse appearance and poses of humans and the limited availability of high-quality training data. To achieve fast and high-quality human reconstruction, this work rethinks the task from the perspectives of dataset, model, and representation. First, we introduce a large-scale HUman-centric GEnerated dataset, HuGe100K, consisting of 100K diverse, photorealistic sets of human images. Each set contains 24-view frames in specific human poses, generated using a pose-controllable image-to-multi-view model. Next, leveraging the diversity in views, poses, and appearances within HuGe100K, we develop a scalable feed-forward transformer model to predict a 3D human Gaussian representation in a uniform space from a given human image. This model is trained to disentangle human pose, body shape, clothing geometry, and texture. The estimated Gaussians can be animated without post-processing. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset and method. Our model demonstrates the ability to efficiently reconstruct photorealistic humans at 1K resolution from a single input image using a single GPU instantly. Additionally, it seamlessly supports various applications, as well as shape and texture editing tasks.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Injection via Prompt Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many practical applications, large language models (LLMs) need to incorporate new knowledge not present in their pre-training data. The primary methods for this are fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Although RAG has emerged as the industry standard for knowledge injection, fine-tuning has not yet achieved comparable success. In this paper, we propose a new fine-tuning technique for learning new knowledge and show that it can reach the performance of RAG. The proposed method is based on the self-distillation approach, which we call prompt distillation. First, we generate question-answer pairs about the new knowledge. Then, we fine-tune a student model on the question-answer pairs to imitate the output distributions of a teacher model, which additionally receives the new knowledge in its prompt. The student model is identical to the teacher, except it is equipped with a LoRA adapter. This training procedure facilitates distilling the new knowledge from the teacher's prompt into the student's weights.</description>

      <title>Stitch Contrast and Segment_Learning a Human Action Segmentation Model Using Trimmed Skeleton Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing skeleton-based human action classification models rely on well-trimmed action-specific skeleton videos for both training and testing, precluding their scalability to real-world applications where untrimmed videos exhibiting concatenated actions are predominant. To overcome this limitation, recently introduced skeleton action segmentation models involve un-trimmed skeleton videos into end-to-end training. The model is optimized to provide frame-wise predictions for any length of testing videos, simultaneously realizing action localization and classification. Yet, achieving such an improvement im-poses frame-wise annotated skeleton videos, which remains time-consuming in practice. This paper features a novel framework for skeleton-based action segmentation trained on short trimmed skeleton videos, but that can run on longer un-trimmed videos. The approach is implemented in three steps: Stitch, Contrast, and Segment. First, Stitch proposes a tem-poral skeleton stitching scheme that treats trimmed skeleton videos as elementary human motions that compose a semantic space and can be sampled to generate multi-action stitched se-quences. Contrast learns contrastive representations from stitched sequences with a novel discrimination pretext task that enables a skeleton encoder to learn meaningful action-temporal contexts to improve action segmentation. Finally, Segment relates the proposed method to action segmentation by learning a segmentation layer while handling particular da-ta availability. Experiments involve a trimmed source dataset and an untrimmed target dataset in an adaptation formulation for real-world skeleton-based human action segmentation to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>DisCo: Graph-Based Disentangled Contrastive Learning for Cold-Start Cross-Domain Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems are widely used in various real-world applications, but they often encounter the persistent challenge of the user cold-start problem. Cross-domain recommendation (CDR), which leverages user interactions from one domain to improve prediction performance in another, has emerged as a promising solution. However, users with similar preferences in the source domain may exhibit different interests in the target domain. Therefore, directly transferring embeddings may introduce irrelevant source-domain collaborative information. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based disentangled contrastive learning framework to capture fine-grained user intent and filter out irrelevant collaborative information, thereby avoiding negative transfer. Specifically, for each domain, we use a multi-channel graph encoder to capture diverse user intents. We then construct the affinity graph in the embedding space and perform multi-step random walks to capture high-order user similarity relationships. Treating one domain as the target, we propose a disentangled intent-wise contrastive learning approach, guided by user similarity, to refine the bridging of user intents across domains. Extensive experiments on four benchmark CDR datasets demonstrate that DisCo consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines, thereby validating the effectiveness of both DisCo and its components.</description>

      <title>Stable-V2A: Synthesis of Synchronized Sound Effects with Temporal and Semantic Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sound designers and Foley artists usually sonorize a scene, such as from a movie or video game, by manually annotating and sonorizing each action of interest in the video. In our case, the intent is to leave full creative control to sound designers with a tool that allows them to bypass the more repetitive parts of their work, thus being able to focus on the creative aspects of sound production. We achieve this presenting Stable-V2A, a two-stage model consisting of: an RMS-Mapper that estimates an envelope representative of the audio characteristics associated with the input video; and Stable-Foley, a diffusion model based on Stable Audio Open that generates audio semantically and temporally aligned with the target video. Temporal alignment is guaranteed by the use of the envelope as a ControlNet input, while semantic alignment is achieved through the use of sound representations chosen by the designer as cross-attention conditioning of the diffusion process. We train and test our model on Greatest Hits, a dataset commonly used to evaluate V2A models. In addition, to test our model on a case study of interest, we introduce Walking The Maps, a dataset of videos extracted from video games depicting animated characters walking in different locations. Samples and code available on our demo page at https://ispamm.github.io/Stable-V2A.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores image modeling from the frequency space and introduces DCTdiff, an end-to-end diffusion generative paradigm that efficiently models images in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) space. We investigate the design space of DCTdiff and reveal the key design factors. Experiments on different frameworks (UViT, DiT), generation tasks, and various diffusion samplers demonstrate that DCTdiff outperforms pixel-based diffusion models regarding generative quality and training efficiency. Remarkably, DCTdiff can seamlessly scale up to high-resolution generation without using the latent diffusion paradigm. Finally, we illustrate several intriguing properties of DCT image modeling. For example, we provide a theoretical proof of why `image diffusion can be seen as spectral autoregression', bridging the gap between diffusion and autoregressive models. The effectiveness of DCTdiff and the introduced properties suggest a promising direction for image modeling in the frequency space.

      <title>MultiverSeg: Scalable Interactive Segmentation of Biomedical Imaging Datasets with In-Context Guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical researchers and clinicians often need to perform novel segmentation tasks on a set of related images. Existing methods for segmenting a new dataset are either interactive, requiring substantial human effort for each image, or require an existing set of manually labeled images. We introduce a system, MultiverSeg, that enables practitioners to rapidly segment an entire new dataset without requiring access to any existing labeled data from that task or domain. Along with the image to segment, the model takes user interactions such as clicks, bounding boxes or scribbles as input, and predicts a segmentation. As the user segments more images, those images and segmentations become additional inputs to the model, providing context. As the context set of labeled images grows, the number of interactions required to segment each new image decreases. We demonstrate that MultiverSeg enables users to interactively segment new datasets efficiently, by amortizing the number of interactions per image to achieve an accurate segmentation. Compared to using a state-of-the-art interactive segmentation method, using MultiverSeg reduced the total number of scribble steps by 53% and clicks by 36% to achieve 90% Dice on sets of images from unseen tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce AceMath, a suite of frontier math models that excel in solving complex math problems, along with highly effective reward models capable of evaluating generated solutions and reliably identifying the correct ones. To develop the instruction-tuned math models, we propose a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process that first achieves competitive performance across general domains, followed by targeted fine-tuning for the math domain using a carefully curated set of prompts and synthetically generated responses. The resulting model, AceMath-72B-Instruct greatly outperforms Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct, GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 Sonnet. To develop math-specialized reward model, we first construct AceMath-RewardBench, a comprehensive and robust benchmark for evaluating math reward models across diverse problems and difficulty levels. After that, we present a systematic approach to build our math reward models. The resulting model, AceMath-72B-RM, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reward models. Furthermore, when combining AceMath-72B-Instruct with AceMath-72B-RM, we achieve the highest average rm@8 score across the math reasoning benchmarks. We will release model weights, training data, and evaluation benchmarks at: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/adlr/acemath</description>

      <title>Tests for model misspecification in simulation-based inference: from local distortions to global model checks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model misspecification analysis strategies, such as anomaly detection, model validation, and model comparison are a key component of scientific model development. Over the last few years, there has been a rapid rise in the use of simulation-based inference (SBI) techniques for Bayesian parameter estimation, applied to increasingly complex forward models. To move towards fully simulation-based analysis pipelines, however, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive simulation-based framework for model misspecification analysis. In this work, we provide a solid and flexible foundation for a wide range of model discrepancy analysis tasks, using distortion-driven model misspecification tests. From a theoretical perspective, we introduce the statistical framework built around performing many hypothesis tests for distortions of the simulation model. We also make explicit analytic connections to classical techniques: anomaly detection, model validation, and goodness-of-fit residual analysis. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient self-calibrating training algorithm that is useful for practitioners. We demonstrate the performance of the framework in multiple scenarios, making the connection to classical results where they are valid. Finally, we show how to conduct such a distortion-driven model misspecification test for real gravitational wave data, specifically on the event GW150914.</description>

      <title>Outcome-Refining Process Supervision for Code Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, yet they often struggle with complex programming tasks that require deep algorithmic reasoning. While process supervision through learned reward models shows promise in guiding reasoning steps, it requires expensive training data and suffers from unreliable evaluation. We propose Outcome-Refining Process Supervision, a novel paradigm that treats outcome refinement itself as the process to be supervised. Our framework leverages concrete execution signals to ground the supervision of reasoning steps, while using tree-structured exploration to maintain multiple solution trajectories simultaneously. Experiments demonstrate that our approach enables even smaller models to achieve high success accuracy and performance metrics on competitive programming tasks, creates more reliable verification than traditional reward models without requiring training PRMs. Our approach achieves significant improvements across 5 models and 3 datasets: an average of 26.9% increase in correctness and 42.2% in efficiency. The results suggest that providing structured reasoning space with concrete verification signals is crucial for solving complex programming tasks. We open-source all our code and data at: https://github.com/zhuohaoyu/ORPS</description>

      <title>Adaptive Pruning for Large Language Models with Structural Importance Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved language understanding and generation capabilities. However, it is difficult to deploy LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices due to their high computational and storage resource demands. To address this issue, we propose a novel LLM model pruning method, namely structurally-aware adaptive pruning (SAAP), to significantly reduce the computational and memory costs while maintaining model performance. We first define an adaptive importance fusion metric to evaluate the importance of all coupled structures in LLMs by considering their homoscedastic uncertainty. Then, we rank the importance of all modules to determine the specific layers that should be pruned to meet particular performance requirements. Furthermore, we develop a new group fine-tuning strategy to improve the inference efficiency of LLMs. Finally, we evaluate the proposed SAAP method on multiple LLMs across two common tasks, i.e., zero-shot classification and text generation. Experimental results show that our SAAP method outperforms several state-of-the-art baseline methods, achieving 2.17%, 2.37%, and 2.39% accuracy gains on LLaMA-7B, Vicuna-7B, and LLaMA-13B. Additionally, SAAP improves the token generation speed by 5%, showcasing its practical advantages in resource-constrained scenarios.</description>

      <title>Jet: A Modern Transformer-Based Normalizing Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past, normalizing generative flows have emerged as a promising class of generative models for natural images. This type of model has many modeling advantages: the ability to efficiently compute log-likelihood of the input data, fast generation and simple overall structure. Normalizing flows remained a topic of active research but later fell out of favor, as visual quality of the samples was not competitive with other model classes, such as GANs, VQ-VAE-based approaches or diffusion models. In this paper we revisit the design of the coupling-based normalizing flow models by carefully ablating prior design choices and using computational blocks based on the Vision Transformer architecture, not convolutional neural networks. As a result, we achieve state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance with a much simpler architecture. While the overall visual quality is still behind the current state-of-the-art models, we argue that strong normalizing flow models can help advancing research frontier by serving as building components of more powerful generative models.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Color Channel Independence for Improved Unsupervised Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object-centric architectures can learn to extract distinct object representations from visual scenes, enabling downstream applications on the object level. Similarly to autoencoder-based image models, object-centric approaches have been trained on the unsupervised reconstruction loss of images encoded by RGB color spaces. In our work, we challenge the common assumption that RGB images are the optimal color space for unsupervised learning in computer vision. We discuss conceptually and empirically that other color spaces, such as HSV, bear essential characteristics for object-centric representation learning, like robustness to lighting conditions. We further show that models improve when requiring them to predict additional color channels. Specifically, we propose to transform the predicted targets to the RGB-S space, which extends RGB with HSV's saturation component and leads to markedly better reconstruction and disentanglement for five common evaluation datasets. The use of composite color spaces can be implemented with basically no computational overhead, is agnostic of the models' architecture, and is universally applicable across a wide range of visual computing tasks and training types. The findings of our approach encourage additional investigations in computer vision tasks beyond object-centric learning.</description>

      <title>Operationalising Rawlsian Ethics for Fairness in Norm-Learning Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social norms are standards of behaviour common in a society. However, when agents make decisions without considering how others are impacted, norms can emerge that lead to the subjugation of certain agents. We present RAWL-E, a method to create ethical norm-learning agents. RAWL-E agents operationalise maximin, a fairness principle from Rawlsian ethics, in their decision-making processes to promote ethical norms by balancing societal well-being with individual goals. We evaluate RAWL-E agents in simulated harvesting scenarios. We find that norms emerging in RAWL-E agent societies enhance social welfare, fairness, and robustness, and yield higher minimum experience compared to those that emerge in agent societies that do not implement Rawlsian ethics.</description>

      <title>HPC-Coder-V2: Studying Code LLMs Across Low-Resource Parallel Languages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based coding tools have been tremendously successful as software development assistants, yet they are often designed for general purpose programming tasks and perform poorly for more specialized domains such as high performance computing. Creating specialized models and tools for these domains is crucial towards gaining the benefits of LLMs in areas such as HPC. While previous work has explored HPC-specific models, LLMs still struggle to generate parallel code and it is not at all clear what hurdles are still holding back these LLMs and what must be done to overcome them. In this work, we conduct an in-depth study along the many axes of fine-tuning a specialized HPC LLM in order to better understand the challenges. Based on our findings we fine-tune and evaluate a specialized HPC LLM that is shown to be the best performing open-source code LLM for parallel code generation to date.</description>

      <title>STRAP: Robot Sub-Trajectory Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robot learning is witnessing a significant increase in the size, diversity, and complexity of pre-collected datasets, mirroring trends in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Many robot learning methods treat such datasets as multi-task expert data and learn a multi-task, generalist policy by training broadly across them. Notably, while these generalist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the performance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to negative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific specialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training policies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than deploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we non-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test time. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts of low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the "sub"-trajectory granularity enables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness in adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory retrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared cross-task content. This work proposes STRAP, a technique for leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models and dynamic time warping to retrieve sub-sequences of trajectories from large training corpora in a robust fashion. STRAP outperforms both prior retrieval algorithms and multi-task learning methods in simulated and real experiments, showing the ability to scale to much larger offline datasets in the real world as well as the ability to learn robust control policies with just a handful of real-world demonstrations.</description>

      <title>LlamaFusion: Adapting Pretrained Language Models for Multimodal Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present LlamaFusion, a framework for empowering pretrained text-only large language models (LLMs) with multimodal generative capabilities, enabling them to understand and generate both text and images in arbitrary sequences. LlamaFusion leverages existing Llama-3's weights for processing texts autoregressively while introducing additional and parallel transformer modules for processing images with diffusion. During training, the data from each modality is routed to its dedicated modules: modality-specific feedforward layers, query-key-value projections, and normalization layers process each modality independently, while the shared self-attention layers allow interactions across text and image features. By freezing the text-specific modules and only training the image-specific modules, LlamaFusion preserves the language capabilities of text-only LLMs while developing strong visual understanding and generation abilities. Compared to methods that pretrain multimodal generative models from scratch, our experiments demonstrate that, LlamaFusion improves image understanding by 20% and image generation by 3.6% using only 50% of the FLOPs while maintaining Llama-3's language capabilities. We also demonstrate that this framework can adapt existing vision-language models with multimodal generation ability. Overall, this framework not only leverages existing computational investments in text-only LLMs but also enables the parallel development of language and vision capabilities, presenting a promising direction for efficient multimodal model development.</description>

      <title>AV-Link: Temporally-Aligned Diffusion Features for Cross-Modal Audio-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose AV-Link, a unified framework for Video-to-Audio and Audio-to-Video generation that leverages the activations of frozen video and audio diffusion models for temporally-aligned cross-modal conditioning. The key to our framework is a Fusion Block that enables bidirectional information exchange between our backbone video and audio diffusion models through a temporally-aligned self attention operation. Unlike prior work that uses feature extractors pretrained for other tasks for the conditioning signal, AV-Link can directly leverage features obtained by the complementary modality in a single framework i.e. video features to generate audio, or audio features to generate video. We extensively evaluate our design choices and demonstrate the ability of our method to achieve synchronized and high-quality audiovisual content, showcasing its potential for applications in immersive media generation.

      <title>Preventing Local Pitfalls in Vector Quantization via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector-quantized networks (VQNs) have exhibited remarkable performance across various tasks, yet they are prone to training instability, which complicates the training process due to the necessity for techniques such as subtle initialization and model distillation. In this study, we identify the local minima issue as the primary cause of this instability. To address this, we integrate an optimal transport method in place of the nearest neighbor search to achieve a more globally informed assignment. We introduce OptVQ, a novel vector quantization method that employs the Sinkhorn algorithm to optimize the optimal transport problem, thereby enhancing the stability and efficiency of the training process. To mitigate the influence of diverse data distributions on the Sinkhorn algorithm, we implement a straightforward yet effective normalization strategy. Our comprehensive experiments on image reconstruction tasks demonstrate that OptVQ achieves 100% codebook utilization and surpasses current state-of-the-art VQNs in reconstruction quality.</description>

      <title>LiDAR-RT: Gaussian-based Ray Tracing for Dynamic LiDAR Re-simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper targets the challenge of real-time LiDAR re-simulation in dynamic driving scenarios. Recent approaches utilize neural radiance fields combined with the physical modeling of LiDAR sensors to achieve high-fidelity re-simulation results. Unfortunately, these methods face limitations due to high computational demands in large-scale scenes and cannot perform real-time LiDAR rendering. To overcome these constraints, we propose LiDAR-RT, a novel framework that supports real-time, physically accurate LiDAR re-simulation for driving scenes. Our primary contribution is the development of an efficient and effective rendering pipeline, which integrates Gaussian primitives and hardware-accelerated ray tracing technology. Specifically, we model the physical properties of LiDAR sensors using Gaussian primitives with learnable parameters and incorporate scene graphs to handle scene dynamics. Building upon this scene representation, our framework first constructs a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH), then casts rays for each pixel and generates novel LiDAR views through a differentiable rendering algorithm. Importantly, our framework supports realistic rendering with flexible scene editing operations and various sensor configurations. Extensive experiments across multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of rendering quality and efficiency.

      <title>AutoTrust: Benchmarking Trustworthiness in Large Vision Language Models for Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large vision language models (VLMs) tailored for autonomous driving (AD) have shown strong scene understanding and reasoning capabilities, making them undeniable candidates for end-to-end driving systems. However, limited work exists on studying the trustworthiness of DriveVLMs -- a critical factor that directly impacts public transportation safety. In this paper, we introduce AutoTrust, a comprehensive trustworthiness benchmark for large vision-language models in autonomous driving (DriveVLMs), considering diverse perspectives -- including trustfulness, safety, robustness, privacy, and fairness. We constructed the largest visual question-answering dataset for investigating trustworthiness issues in driving scenarios, comprising over 10k unique scenes and 18k queries. We evaluated six publicly available VLMs, spanning from generalist to specialist, from open-source to commercial models. Our exhaustive evaluations have unveiled previously undiscovered vulnerabilities of DriveVLMs to trustworthiness threats. Specifically, we found that the general VLMs like LLaVA-v1.6 and GPT-4o-mini surprisingly outperform specialized models fine-tuned for driving in terms of overall trustworthiness. DriveVLMs like DriveLM-Agent are particularly vulnerable to disclosing sensitive information. Additionally, both generalist and specialist VLMs remain susceptible to adversarial attacks and struggle to ensure unbiased decision-making across diverse environments and populations. Our findings call for immediate and decisive action to address the trustworthiness of DriveVLMs -- an issue of critical importance to public safety and the welfare of all citizens relying on autonomous transportation systems. Our benchmark is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/taco-group/AutoTrust}, and the leaderboard is released at \url{https://taco-group.github.io/AutoTrust/}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they have made a significant impact across a wide range of real-world applications, particularly in Autonomous Driving (AD). Their ability to process complex visual data and reason about intricate driving scenarios has paved the way for a new paradigm in end-to-end AD systems. However, the progress of developing end-to-end models for AD has been slow, as existing fine-tuning methods demand substantial resources, including extensive computational power, large-scale datasets, and significant funding. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in inference computing, we propose OpenEMMA, an open-source end-to-end framework based on MLLMs. By incorporating the Chain-of-Thought reasoning process, OpenEMMA achieves significant improvements compared to the baseline when leveraging a diverse range of MLLMs. Furthermore, OpenEMMA demonstrates effectiveness, generalizability, and robustness across a variety of challenging driving scenarios, offering a more efficient and effective approach to autonomous driving. We release all the codes in https://github.com/taco-group/OpenEMMA.</description>

      <title>PRIMA: Multi-Image Vision-Language Models for Reasoning Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), existing pixel-grounding models operate on single-image settings, limiting their ability to perform detailed, fine-grained comparisons across multiple images. Conversely, current multi-image understanding models lack pixel-level grounding. Our work addresses this gap by introducing the task of multi-image pixel-grounded reasoning segmentation, and PRIMA, a novel LVLM that integrates pixel-level grounding with robust multi-image reasoning capabilities to produce contextually rich, pixel-grounded explanations. Central to PRIMA is an efficient vision module that queries fine-grained visual representations across multiple images, reducing TFLOPs by $25.3\%$. To support training and evaluation, we curate $M^4Seg$, a new reasoning segmentation benchmark consisting of $\sim$224K question-answer pairs that require fine-grained visual understanding across multiple images. Experimental results demonstrate PRIMA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Scaling 4D Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling has not yet been convincingly demonstrated for pure self-supervised learning from video. However, prior work has focused evaluations on semantic-related tasks $\unicode{x2013}$ action classification, ImageNet classification, etc. In this paper we focus on evaluating self-supervised learning on non-semantic vision tasks that are more spatial (3D) and temporal (+1D = 4D), such as camera pose estimation, point and object tracking, and depth estimation. We show that by learning from very large video datasets, masked auto-encoding (MAE) with transformer video models actually scales, consistently improving performance on these 4D tasks, as model size increases from 20M all the way to the largest by far reported self-supervised video model $\unicode{x2013}$ 22B parameters. Rigorous apples-to-apples comparison with many recent image and video models demonstrates the benefits of scaling 4D representations.</description>

      <title>Selective Uncertainty Propagation in Offline RL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the finite-horizon offline reinforcement learning (RL) setting, and are motivated by the challenge of learning the policy at any step h in dynamic programming (DP) algorithms. To learn this, it is sufficient to evaluate the treatment effect of deviating from the behavioral policy at step h after having optimized the policy for all future steps. Since the policy at any step can affect next-state distributions, the related distributional shift challenges can make this problem far more statistically hard than estimating such treatment effects in the stochastic contextual bandit setting. However, the hardness of many real-world RL instances lies between the two regimes. We develop a flexible and general method called selective uncertainty propagation for confidence interval construction that adapts to the hardness of the associated distribution shift challenges. We show benefits of our approach on toy environments and demonstrate the benefits of these techniques for offline policy learning.</description>

      <title>Learning Discretized Neural Networks under Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03390v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Discretized Neural Networks (DNNs) composed of low-precision weights and activations, which suffer from either infinite or zero gradients due to the non-differentiable discrete function during training. Most training-based DNNs in such scenarios employ the standard Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to approximate the gradient w.r.t. discrete values. However, the use of STE introduces the problem of gradient mismatch, arising from perturbations in the approximated gradient. To address this problem, this paper reveals that this mismatch can be interpreted as a metric perturbation in a Riemannian manifold, viewed through the lens of duality theory. Building on information geometry, we construct the Linearly Nearly Euclidean (LNE) manifold for DNNs, providing a background for addressing perturbations. By introducing a partial differential equation on metrics, i.e., the Ricci flow, we establish the dynamical stability and convergence of the LNE metric with the $L^2$-norm perturbation. In contrast to previous perturbation theories with convergence rates in fractional powers, the metric perturbation under the Ricci flow exhibits exponential decay in the LNE manifold. Experimental results across various datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior and more stable performance for DNNs compared to other representative training-based methods.</description>

      <title>On the Expressivity of Persistent Homology in Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09826v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent homology, a technique from computational topology, has recently shown strong empirical performance in the context of graph classification. Being able to capture long range graph properties via higher-order topological features, such as cycles of arbitrary length, in combination with multi-scale topological descriptors, has improved predictive performance for data sets with prominent topological structures, such as molecules. At the same time, the theoretical properties of persistent homology have not been formally assessed in this context. This paper intends to bridge the gap between computational topology and graph machine learning by providing a brief introduction to persistent homology in the context of graphs, as well as a theoretical discussion and empirical analysis of its expressivity for graph learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Imitation Learning in Single-Agent Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is one of the most widely used methods in machine learning. Yet, many works find it is often unable to fully recover the underlying expert behavior, even in constrained environments like single-agent games. However, none of these works deeply investigate the role of scaling up the model and data size. Inspired by recent work in Natural Language Processing (NLP) where "scaling up" has resulted in increasingly more capable LLMs, we investigate whether carefully scaling up model and data size can bring similar improvements in the imitation learning setting for single-agent games. We first demonstrate our findings on a variety of Atari games, and thereafter focus on the extremely challenging game of NetHack. In all games, we find that IL loss and mean return scale smoothly with the compute budget (FLOPs) and are strongly correlated, resulting in power laws for training compute-optimal IL agents. Finally, we forecast and train several NetHack agents with IL and find they outperform prior state-of-the-art by 1.5x in all settings. Our work both demonstrates the scaling behavior of imitation learning in a variety of single-agent games, as well as the viability of scaling up current approaches for increasingly capable agents in NetHack, a game that remains elusively hard for current AI systems.</description>

      <title>DTW+S: Shape-based Comparison of Time-series with Ordered Local Trend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring distance or similarity between time-series data is a fundamental aspect of many applications including classification, clustering, and ensembling/alignment. Existing measures may fail to capture similarities among local trends (shapes) and may even produce misleading results. Our goal is to develop a measure that looks for similar trends occurring around similar times and is easily interpretable for researchers in applied domains. This is particularly useful for applications where time-series have a sequence of meaningful local trends that are ordered, such as in epidemics (a surge to an increase to a peak to a decrease). We propose a novel measure, DTW+S, which creates an interpretable "closeness-preserving" matrix representation of the time-series, where each column represents local trends, and then it applies Dynamic Time Warping to compute distances between these matrices. We present a theoretical analysis that supports the choice of this representation. We demonstrate the utility of DTW+S in several tasks. For the clustering of epidemic curves, we show that DTW+S is the only measure able to produce good clustering compared to the baselines. For ensemble building, we propose a combination of DTW+S and barycenter averaging that results in the best preservation of characteristics of the underlying trajectories. We also demonstrate that our approach results in better classification compared to Dynamic Time Warping for a class of datasets, particularly when local trends rather than scale play a decisive role.</description>

      <title>Scalable Acceleration for Classification-Based Derivative-Free Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Derivative-free optimization algorithms play an important role in scientific and engineering design optimization problems, especially when derivative information is not accessible. In this paper, we study the framework of sequential classification-based derivative-free optimization algorithms. By introducing learning theoretic concept hypothesis-target shattering rate, we revisit the computational complexity upper bound of SRACOS (Hu, Qian, and Yu 2017). Inspired by the revisited upper bound, we propose an algorithm named RACE-CARS, which adds a random region-shrinking step compared with SRACOS. We further establish theorems showing the acceleration by region shrinking. Experiments on the synthetic functions as well as black-box tuning for language-model-as-a-service demonstrate empirically the efficiency of RACE-CARS. An ablation experiment on the introduced hyperparameters is also conducted, revealing the mechanism of RACE-CARS and putting forward an empirical hyper-parameter tuning guidance.</description>

      <title>DavIR: Data Selection via Implicit Reward for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce DavIR, a model-based data selection method for post-training Large Language Models. DavIR generalizes Reducible Holdout Loss to core-set selection problem of causal language modeling, and quantifies the learnability of a given datum with respect to a pre-trained LLM based on relative reduction in loss during fine-tuning, a metric we show to be closely related to the implicit reward model described in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We show that 6% of Alpaca dataset selected with DavIR can steer both the LLaMA and Gemma model family to produce superior performance compared to the same models trained on the full 52K dataset. We also show that Alpaca dataset compressed with DavIR can be combined with GSM8K dataset to effectively balance open-domain freeform QA and mathematical reasoning capabilities. Finally, we apply the DavIR objective to DPO and develop a normalized DavIR-DPO objective which improves alignment performance of Zephyr-7B-SFT model by 8% (relative) on AlpacaEval, compared against training on vanilla DPO objective.</description>

      <title>Robust and Communication-Efficient Federated Domain Adaptation via Random Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern machine learning (ML) models have grown to a scale where training them on a single machine becomes impractical. As a result, there is a growing trend to leverage federated learning (FL) techniques to train large ML models in a distributed and collaborative manner. These models, however, when deployed on new devices, might struggle to generalize well due to domain shifts. In this context, federated domain adaptation (FDA) emerges as a powerful approach to address this challenge.
  Most existing FDA approaches typically focus on aligning the distributions between source and target domains by minimizing their (e.g., MMD) distance. Such strategies, however, inevitably introduce high communication overheads and can be highly sensitive to network reliability.
  In this paper, we introduce RF-TCA, an enhancement to the standard Transfer Component Analysis approach that significantly accelerates computation without compromising theoretical and empirical performance. Leveraging the computational advantage of RF-TCA, we further extend it to FDA setting with FedRF-TCA. The proposed FedRF-TCA protocol boasts communication complexity that is independent of the sample size, while maintaining performance that is either comparable to or even surpasses state-of-the-art FDA methods. We present extensive experiments to showcase the superior performance and robustness (to network condition) of FedRF-TCA.</description>

      <title>MetaSymNet: A Tree-like Symbol Network with Adaptive Architecture and Activation Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical formulas serve as the means of communication between humans and nature, encapsulating the operational laws governing natural phenomena. The concise formulation of these laws is a crucial objective in scientific research and an important challenge for artificial intelligence (AI). While traditional artificial neural networks (MLP) excel at data fitting, they often yield uninterpretable black box results that hinder our understanding of the relationship between variables x and predicted values y. Moreover, the fixed network architecture in MLP often gives rise to redundancy in both network structure and parameters. To address these issues, we propose MetaSymNet, a novel neural network that dynamically adjusts its structure in real-time, allowing for both expansion and contraction. This adaptive network employs the PANGU meta function as its activation function, which is a unique type capable of evolving into various basic functions during training to compose mathematical formulas tailored to specific needs. We then evolve the neural network into a concise, interpretable mathematical expression. To evaluate MetaSymNet's performance, we compare it with four state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms across more than 10 public datasets comprising 222 formulas. Our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms others consistently regardless of noise presence or absence. Furthermore, we assess MetaSymNet against MLP and SVM regarding their fitting ability and extrapolation capability, these are two essential aspects of machine learning algorithms. The findings reveal that our algorithm excels in both areas. Finally, we compared MetaSymNet with MLP using iterative pruning in network structure complexity. The results show that MetaSymNet's network structure complexity is obviously less than MLP under the same goodness of fit.</description>

      <title>RankFeat&amp;RankWeight: Rank-1 Feature/Weight Removal for Out-of-distribution Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13959v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying machine learning models in real-world settings. In this paper, we observe that the singular value distributions of the in-distribution (ID) and OOD features are quite different: the OOD feature matrix tends to have a larger dominant singular value than the ID feature, and the class predictions of OOD samples are largely determined by it. This observation motivates us to propose \texttt{RankFeat}, a simple yet effective \emph{post hoc} approach for OOD detection by removing the rank-1 matrix composed of the largest singular value and the associated singular vectors from the high-level feature. \texttt{RankFeat} achieves \emph{state-of-the-art} performance and reduces the average false positive rate (FPR95) by 17.90\% compared with the previous best method. The success of \texttt{RankFeat} motivates us to investigate whether a similar phenomenon would exist in the parameter matrices of neural networks. We thus propose \texttt{RankWeight} which removes the rank-1 weight from the parameter matrices of a single deep layer. Our \texttt{RankWeight}is also \emph{post hoc} and only requires computing the rank-1 matrix once. As a standalone approach, \texttt{RankWeight} has very competitive performance against other methods across various backbones. Moreover, \texttt{RankWeight} enjoys flexible compatibility with a wide range of OOD detection methods. The combination of \texttt{RankWeight} and \texttt{RankFeat} refreshes the new \emph{state-of-the-art} performance, achieving the FPR95 as low as 16.13\% on the ImageNet-1k benchmark. Extensive ablation studies and comprehensive theoretical analyses are presented to support the empirical results.

Abstract: Real-world time series analysis faces significant challenges when dealing with irregular and incomplete data. While Neural Differential Equation (NDE) based methods have shown promise, they struggle with limited expressiveness, scalability issues, and stability concerns. Conversely, Neural Flows offer stability but falter with irregular data. We introduce 'DualDynamics', a novel framework that synergistically combines NDE-based method and Neural Flow-based method. This approach enhances expressive power while balancing computational demands, addressing critical limitations of existing techniques. We demonstrate DualDynamics' effectiveness across diverse tasks: classification of robustness to dataset shift, irregularly-sampled series analysis, interpolation of missing data, and forecasting with partial observations. Our results show consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art methods, indicating DualDynamics' potential to advance irregular time series analysis significantly.</description>

      <title>TurboSVM-FL: Boosting Federated Learning through SVM Aggregation for Lazy Clients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12012v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning is a distributed collaborative machine learning paradigm that has gained strong momentum in recent years. In federated learning, a central server periodically coordinates models with clients and aggregates the models trained locally by clients without necessitating access to local data. Despite its potential, the implementation of federated learning continues to encounter several challenges, predominantly the slow convergence that is largely due to data heterogeneity. The slow convergence becomes particularly problematic in cross-device federated learning scenarios where clients may be strongly limited by computing power and storage space, and hence counteracting methods that induce additional computation or memory cost on the client side such as auxiliary objective terms and larger training iterations can be impractical. In this paper, we propose a novel federated aggregation strategy, TurboSVM-FL, that poses no additional computation burden on the client side and can significantly accelerate convergence for federated classification task, especially when clients are "lazy" and train their models solely for few epochs for next global aggregation. TurboSVM-FL extensively utilizes support vector machine to conduct selective aggregation and max-margin spread-out regularization on class embeddings. We evaluate TurboSVM-FL on multiple datasets including FEMNIST, CelebA, and Shakespeare using user-independent validation with non-iid data distribution. Our results show that TurboSVM-FL can significantly outperform existing popular algorithms on convergence rate and reduce communication rounds while delivering better test metrics including accuracy, F1 score, and MCC.</description>

      <title>XTSFormer: Cross-Temporal-Scale Transformer for Irregular-Time Event Prediction in Clinical Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adverse clinical events related to unsafe care are among the top ten causes of death in the U.S. Accurate modeling and prediction of clinical events from electronic health records (EHRs) play a crucial role in patient safety enhancement. An example is modeling de facto care pathways that characterize common step-by-step plans for treatment or care. However, clinical event data pose several unique challenges, including the irregularity of time intervals between consecutive events, the existence of cycles, periodicity, multi-scale event interactions, and the high computational costs associated with long event sequences. Existing neural temporal point processes (TPPs) methods do not effectively capture the multi-scale nature of event interactions, which is common in many real-world clinical applications. To address these issues, we propose the cross-temporal-scale transformer (XTSFormer), specifically designed for irregularly timed event data. Our model consists of two vital components: a novel Feature-based Cycle-aware Time Positional Encoding (FCPE) that adeptly captures the cyclical nature of time, and a hierarchical multi-scale temporal attention mechanism, where different temporal scales are determined by a bottom-up clustering approach. Extensive experiments on several real-world EHR datasets show that our XTSFormer outperforms multiple baseline methods. The code is available at https://github.com/spatialdatasciencegroup/XTSFormer.</description>

      <title>Clustering of timed sequences -- Application to the analysis of care pathways</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improving the future of healthcare starts by better understanding the current actual practices in hospital settings. This motivates the objective of discovering typical care pathways from patient data. Revealing typical care pathways can be achieved through clustering. The difficulty in clustering care pathways, represented by sequences of timestamped events, lies in defining a semantically appropriate metric and clustering algorithms. In this article, we adapt two methods developed for time series to the clustering of timed sequences: the drop-DTW metric and the DBA approach for the construction of averaged time sequences. These methods are then applied in clustering algorithms to propose original and sound clustering algorithms for timed sequences. This approach is experimented with and evaluated on synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Towards trustable SHAP scores</title>

Abstract: SHAP scores represent the proposed use of the well-known Shapley values in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Recent work has shown that the exact computation of SHAP scores can produce unsatisfactory results. Concretely, for some ML models, SHAP scores will mislead with respect to relative feature influence. To address these limitations, recently proposed alternatives exploit different axiomatic aggregations, all of which are defined in terms of abductive explanations. However, the proposed axiomatic aggregations are not Shapley values. This paper investigates how SHAP scores can be modified so as to extend axiomatic aggregations to the case of Shapley values in XAI. More importantly, the proposed new definition of SHAP scores avoids all the known cases where unsatisfactory results have been identified. The paper also characterizes the complexity of computing the novel definition of SHAP scores, highlighting families of classifiers for which computing these scores is tractable. Furthermore, the paper proposes modifications to the existing implementations of SHAP scores. These modifications eliminate some of the known limitations of SHAP scores, and have negligible impact in terms of performance.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Human-Allied Learning of Probabilistic Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) have emerged as an efficient framework for representing and learning complex probability distributions. Nevertheless, the existing body of research on PCs predominantly concentrates on data-driven parameter learning, often neglecting the potential of knowledge-intensive learning, a particular issue in data-scarce/knowledge-rich domains such as healthcare. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel unified framework that can systematically integrate diverse domain knowledge into the parameter learning process of PCs. Experiments on several benchmarks as well as real world datasets show that our proposed framework can both effectively and efficiently leverage domain knowledge to achieve superior performance compared to purely data-driven learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Mitigating federated learning contribution allocation instability through randomized aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative and privacy-preserving Machine Learning paradigm, allowing the development of robust models without the need to centralise sensitive data. A critical challenge in FL lies in fairly and accurately allocating contributions from diverse participants. Inaccurate allocation can undermine trust, lead to unfair compensation, and thus participants may lack the incentive to join or actively contribute to the federation.
  Various remuneration strategies have been proposed to date, including auction-based approaches and Shapley-value based methods, the latter offering a means to quantify the contribution of each participant. However, little to no work has studied the stability of these contribution evaluation methods.
  In this paper, we focus on calculating contributions using gradient-based model reconstruction techniques with Shapley values. We first show that baseline Shapley values do not accurately reflect clients' contributions, leading to unstable reward allocations amongst participants in a cross-silo federation. We then introduce \textsc{FedRandom}, a new method that mitigates these shortcomings with additional data samplings, and show its efficacy at increasing the stability of contribution evaluation in federated learning.</description>

      <title>Learning from Linear Algebra: A Graph Neural Network Approach to Preconditioner Design for Conjugate Gradient Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large linear systems are ubiquitous in modern computational science and engineering. The main recipe for solving them is the use of Krylov subspace iterative methods with well-designed preconditioners. Deep learning models can be used as nonlinear preconditioners during the iteration of linear solvers such as the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Neural network models require an enormous number of parameters to approximate well in this setup. Another approach is to take advantage of small graph neural networks (GNNs) to construct preconditioners with predefined sparsity patterns. Recently, GNNs have been shown to be a promising tool for designing preconditioners to reduce the overall computational cost of iterative methods by constructing them more efficiently than with classical linear algebra techniques. However, preconditioners designed with these approaches cannot outperform those designed with classical methods in terms of the number of iterations in CG. In our work, we recall well-established preconditioners from linear algebra and use them as a starting point for training the GNN to obtain preconditioners that reduce the condition number of the system more significantly. Numerical experiments show that our approach outperforms both classical and neural network-based methods for an important class of parametric partial differential equations. We also provide a heuristic justification for the loss function used and show that preconditioners obtained by learning with this loss function reduce the condition number in a more desirable way for CG.</description>

      <title>Do Parameters Reveal More than Loss for Membership Inference?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11544v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Membership inference attacks are used as a key tool for disclosure auditing. They aim to infer whether an individual record was used to train a model. While such evaluations are useful to demonstrate risk, they are computationally expensive and often make strong assumptions about potential adversaries' access to models and training environments, and thus do not provide tight bounds on leakage from potential attacks. We show how prior claims around black-box access being sufficient for optimal membership inference do not hold for stochastic gradient descent, and that optimal membership inference indeed requires white-box access. Our theoretical results lead to a new white-box inference attack, IHA (Inverse Hessian Attack), that explicitly uses model parameters by taking advantage of computing inverse-Hessian vector products. Our results show that both auditors and adversaries may be able to benefit from access to model parameters, and we advocate for further research into white-box methods for membership inference.</description>

      <title>Latent Variable Sequence Identification for Cognitive Models with Neural Network Estimators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracting time-varying latent variables from computational cognitive models is a key step in model-based neural analysis, which aims to understand the neural correlates of cognitive processes. However, existing methods only allow researchers to infer latent variables that explain subjects' behavior in a relatively small class of cognitive models. For example, a broad class of relevant cognitive models with analytically intractable likelihood is currently out of reach from standard techniques, based on Maximum a Posteriori parameter estimation. Here, we present an approach that extends neural Bayes estimation to learn a direct mapping between experimental data and the targeted latent variable space using recurrent neural networks and simulated datasets. We show that our approach achieves competitive performance in inferring latent variable sequences in both tractable and intractable models. Furthermore, the approach is generalizable across different computational models and is adaptable for both continuous and discrete latent spaces. We then demonstrate its applicability in real world datasets. Our work underscores that combining recurrent neural networks and simulation-based inference to identify latent variable sequences can enable researchers to access a wider class of cognitive models for model-based neural analyses, and thus test a broader set of theories.</description>

      <title>Cherry on the Cake: Fairness is NOT an Optimization Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Fair AI literature, the practice of maliciously creating unfair models that nevertheless satisfy fairness constraints is known as "cherry-picking". A cherry-picking model is a model that makes mistakes on purpose, selecting bad individuals from a minority class instead of better candidates from the same minority. The model literally cherry-picks whom to select to superficially meet the fairness constraints while making minimal changes to the unfair model. This practice has been described as "blatantly unfair" and has a negative impact on already marginalized communities, undermining the intended purpose of fairness measures specifically designed to protect these communities. A common assumption is that cherry-picking arises solely from malicious intent and that models designed only to optimize fairness metrics would avoid this behavior. We show that this is not the case: models optimized to minimize fairness metrics while maximizing performance are often forced to cherry-pick to some degree. In other words, cherry-picking might be an inevitable outcome of the optimization process itself. To demonstrate this, we use tools from fair cake-cutting, a mathematical subfield that studies the problem of fairly dividing a resource, referred to as the "cake," among a number of participants. This concept is connected to supervised multi-label classification: any dataset can be thought of as a cake that needs to be distributed among different labels, and the model is the function that divides the cake. We adapt these classical results for machine learning and demonstrate how this connection can be prolifically used for fairness and classification in general.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Machine Unlearning with Dimensional Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine unlearning, an emerging research topic focusing on compliance with data privacy regulations, enables trained models to remove the information learned from specific data. While many existing methods indirectly address this issue by intentionally injecting incorrect supervisions, they can drastically and unpredictably alter the decision boundaries and feature spaces, leading to training instability and undesired side effects. To fundamentally approach this task, we first analyze the changes in latent feature spaces between original and retrained models, and observe that the feature representations of samples not involved in training are closely aligned with the feature manifolds of previously seen samples in training. Based on these findings, we introduce a novel evaluation metric for machine unlearning, coined dimensional alignment, which measures the alignment between the eigenspaces of the forget and retain set samples. We employ this metric as a regularizer loss to build a robust and stable unlearning framework, which is further enhanced by integrating a self-distillation loss and an alternating training scheme. Our framework effectively eliminates information from the forget set and preserves knowledge from the retain set. Lastly, we identify critical flaws in established evaluation metrics for machine unlearning, and introduce new evaluation tools that more accurately reflect the fundamental goals of machine unlearning.</description>

      <title>Safetywashing: Do AI Safety Benchmarks Actually Measure Safety Progress?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems grow more powerful, there has been increasing interest in "AI safety" research to address emerging and future risks. However, the field of AI safety remains poorly defined and inconsistently measured, leading to confusion about how researchers can contribute. This lack of clarity is compounded by the unclear relationship between AI safety benchmarks and upstream general capabilities (e.g., general knowledge and reasoning). To address these issues, we conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis of AI safety benchmarks, empirically analyzing their correlation with general capabilities across dozens of models and providing a survey of existing directions in AI safety. Our findings reveal that many safety benchmarks highly correlate with both upstream model capabilities and training compute, potentially enabling "safetywashing" -- where capability improvements are misrepresented as safety advancements. Based on these findings, we propose an empirical foundation for developing more meaningful safety metrics and define AI safety in a machine learning research context as a set of clearly delineated research goals that are empirically separable from generic capabilities advancements. In doing so, we aim to provide a more rigorous framework for AI safety research, advancing the science of safety evaluations and clarifying the path towards measurable progress.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Ethereum Fraud Detection via Generative and Contrastive Self-supervision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rampant fraudulent activities on Ethereum hinder the healthy development of the blockchain ecosystem, necessitating the reinforcement of regulations. However, multiple imbalances involving account interaction frequencies and interaction types in the Ethereum transaction environment pose significant challenges to data mining-based fraud detection research. To address this, we first propose the concept of meta-interactions to refine interaction behaviors in Ethereum, and based on this, we present a dual self-supervision enhanced Ethereum fraud detection framework, named Meta-IFD. This framework initially introduces a generative self-supervision mechanism to augment the interaction features of accounts, followed by a contrastive self-supervision mechanism to differentiate various behavior patterns, and ultimately characterizes the behavioral representations of accounts and mines potential fraud risks through multi-view interaction feature learning. Extensive experiments on real Ethereum datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework in detecting common Ethereum fraud behaviors such as Ponzi schemes and phishing scams. Additionally, the generative module can effectively alleviate the interaction distribution imbalance in Ethereum data, while the contrastive module significantly enhances the framework's ability to distinguish different behavior patterns. The source code will be available in https://github.com/GISec-Team/Meta-IFD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In causal inference, encouragement designs (EDs) are widely used to analyze causal effects, when randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are impractical or compliance to treatment cannot be perfectly enforced. Unlike RCTs, which directly allocate treatments, EDs randomly assign encouragement policies that positively motivate individuals to engage in a specific treatment. These random encouragements act as instrumental variables (IVs), facilitating the identification of causal effects through leveraging exogenous perturbations in discrete treatment scenarios. However, real-world applications of encouragement designs often face challenges such as incomplete randomization, limited experimental data, and significantly fewer encouragements compared to treatments, hindering precise causal effect estimation. To address this, this paper introduces novel theories and algorithms for identifying the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) using variations in encouragement. Further, by leveraging both observational and encouragement data, we propose a generalized IV estimator, named Encouragement-based Counterfactual Regression (EnCounteR), to effectively estimate the causal effects. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of EnCounteR over existing methods.</description>

Abstract: This study challenges strictly guaranteeing ``dissipativity'' of a dynamical system represented by neural networks learned from given time-series data. Dissipativity is a crucial indicator for dynamical systems that generalizes stability and input-output stability, known to be valid across various systems including robotics, biological systems, and molecular dynamics. By analytically proving the general solution to the nonlinear Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for dissipativity, we propose a differentiable projection that transforms any dynamics represented by neural networks into dissipative ones and a learning method for the transformed dynamics. Utilizing the generality of dissipativity, our method strictly guarantee stability, input-output stability, and energy conservation of trained dynamical systems. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our method against out-of-domain input through applications to robotic arms and fluid dynamics.

      <title>Sum of Squares Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing expressive generative models that support exact and efficient inference is a core question in probabilistic ML. Probabilistic circuits (PCs) offer a framework where this tractability-vs-expressiveness trade-off can be analyzed theoretically. Recently, squared PCs encoding subtractive mixtures via negative parameters have emerged as tractable models that can be exponentially more expressive than monotonic PCs, i.e., PCs with positive parameters only. In this paper, we provide a more precise theoretical characterization of the expressiveness relationships among these models. First, we prove that squared PCs can be less expressive than monotonic ones. Second, we formalize a novel class of PCs -- sum of squares PCs -- that can be exponentially more expressive than both squared and monotonic PCs. Around sum of squares PCs, we build an expressiveness hierarchy that allows us to precisely unify and separate different tractable model classes such as Born Machines and PSD models, and other recently introduced tractable probabilistic models by using complex parameters. Finally, we empirically show the effectiveness of sum of squares circuits in performing distribution estimation.</description>

      <title>LLMs as Zero-shot Graph Learners: Alignment of GNN Representations with LLM Token Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-shot graph machine learning, especially with graph neural networks (GNNs), has garnered significant interest due to the challenge of scarce labeled data. While methods like self-supervised learning and graph prompt learning have been extensively explored, they often rely on fine-tuning with task-specific labels, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of instruction-fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework named Token Embedding-Aligned Graph Language Model (TEA-GLM) that leverages LLMs as cross-dataset and cross-task zero-shot learners for graph machine learning. Concretely, we pretrain a GNN, aligning its representations with token embeddings of an LLM. We then train a linear projector that transforms the GNN's representations into a fixed number of graph token embeddings without tuning the LLM. A unified instruction is designed for various graph tasks at different levels, such as node classification (node-level) and link prediction (edge-level). These design choices collectively enhance our method's effectiveness in zero-shot learning, setting it apart from existing methods. Experiments show that our graph token embeddings help the LLM predictor achieve state-of-the-art performance on unseen datasets and tasks compared to other methods using LLMs as predictors.</description>

      <title>Latent Ewald summation for machine learning of long-range interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often neglect long-range interactions, such as electrostatic and dispersion forces. In this work, we introduce a straightforward and efficient method to account for long-range interactions by learning a latent variable from local atomic descriptors and applying an Ewald summation to this variable. We demonstrate that in systems including charged and polar molecular dimers, bulk water, and water-vapor interface, standard short-ranged MLIPs can lead to unphysical predictions even when employing message passing. The long-range models effectively eliminate these artifacts, with only about twice the computational cost of short-range MLIPs.</description>

      <title>Alt-MoE: Multimodal Alignment via Alternating Optimization of Multi-directional MoE with Unimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent Large Multi-Modal Models (LMMs) have made significant advancements in multi-modal alignment by employing lightweight connection modules to facilitate the representation and fusion of knowledge from existing pre-trained uni-modal models. However, these methods still rely on modality-specific and direction-specific connectors, leading to compartmentalized knowledge representations and reduced computational efficiency, which limits the model's ability to form unified multi-modal representations. To address these issues, we introduce a novel training framework, Alt-MoE, which employs the Mixture of Experts (MoE) as a unified multi-directional connector across modalities, and employs a multi-step sequential alternating unidirectional alignment strategy, which converges to bidirectional alignment over iterations. The extensive empirical studies revealed the following key points: 1) Alt-MoE achieves competitive results by integrating diverse knowledge representations from uni-modal models. This approach seamlessly fuses the specialized expertise of existing high-performance uni-modal models, effectively synthesizing their domain-specific knowledge into a cohesive multi-modal representation. 2) Alt-MoE efficiently scales to new tasks and modalities without altering its model architecture or training strategy. Furthermore, Alt-MoE operates in latent space, supporting vector pre-storage and real-time retrieval via lightweight multi-directional MoE, thereby facilitating massive data processing. Our methodology has been validated on several well-performing uni-modal models (LLAMA3, Qwen2, and DINOv2), achieving competitive results on a wide range of downstream tasks and datasets.</description>

      <title>Erase then Rectify: A Training-Free Parameter Editing Approach for Cost-Effective Graph Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph unlearning, which aims to eliminate the influence of specific nodes, edges, or attributes from a trained Graph Neural Network (GNN), is essential in applications where privacy, bias, or data obsolescence is a concern. However, existing graph unlearning techniques often necessitate additional training on the remaining data, leading to significant computational costs, particularly with large-scale graphs. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage training-free approach, Erase then Rectify (ETR), designed for efficient and scalable graph unlearning while preserving the model utility. Specifically, we first build a theoretical foundation showing that masking parameters critical for unlearned samples enables effective unlearning. Building on this insight, the Erase stage strategically edits model parameters to eliminate the impact of unlearned samples and their propagated influence on intercorrelated nodes. To further ensure the GNN's utility, the Rectify stage devises a gradient approximation method to estimate the model's gradient on the remaining dataset, which is then used to enhance model performance. Overall, ETR achieves graph unlearning without additional training or full training data access, significantly reducing computational overhead and preserving data privacy. Extensive experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate the consistent superiority of ETR in model utility, unlearning efficiency, and unlearning effectiveness, establishing it as a promising solution for real-world graph unlearning challenges.</description>

      <title>T-JEPA: Augmentation-Free Self-Supervised Learning for Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervision is often used for pre-training to foster performance on a downstream task by constructing meaningful representations of samples. Self-supervised learning (SSL) generally involves generating different views of the same sample and thus requires data augmentations that are challenging to construct for tabular data. This constitutes one of the main challenges of self-supervision for structured data. In the present work, we propose a novel augmentation-free SSL method for tabular data. Our approach, T-JEPA, relies on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) and is akin to mask reconstruction in the latent space. It involves predicting the latent representation of one subset of features from the latent representation of a different subset within the same sample, thereby learning rich representations without augmentations. We use our method as a pre-training technique and train several deep classifiers on the obtained representation. Our experimental results demonstrate a substantial improvement in both classification and regression tasks, outperforming models trained directly on samples in their original data space. Moreover, T-JEPA enables some methods to consistently outperform or match the performance of traditional methods likes Gradient Boosted Decision Trees. To understand why, we extensively characterize the obtained representations and show that T-JEPA effectively identifies relevant features for downstream tasks without access to the labels. Additionally, we introduce regularization tokens, a novel regularization method critical for training of JEPA-based models on structured data.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Diffusion Transformers with Token-wise Feature Caching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion transformers have shown significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis at the expense of huge computation costs. To address this problem, feature caching methods have been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the features in previous timesteps and reusing them in the following timesteps. However, previous caching methods ignore that different tokens exhibit different sensitivities to feature caching, and feature caching on some tokens may lead to 10$\times$ more destruction to the overall generation quality compared with other tokens. In this paper, we introduce token-wise feature caching, allowing us to adaptively select the most suitable tokens for caching, and further enable us to apply different caching ratios to neural layers in different types and depths. Extensive experiments on PixArt-$\alpha$, OpenSora, and DiT demonstrate our effectiveness in both image and video generation with no requirements for training. For instance, 2.36$\times$ and 1.93$\times$ acceleration are achieved on OpenSora and PixArt-$\alpha$ with almost no drop in generation quality.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel approach for accelerating AI performance by leveraging Anderson extrapolation, a vector-to-vector mapping technique based on a window of historical iterations. By identifying the crossover point (Fig. 1) where a mixing penalty is incurred, the method focuses on reducing iterations to convergence, with fewer more compute-intensive but generally cacheable iterations, balancing speed and memory usage with accuracy and algorithmic stability, respectively. We demonstrate significant improvements, in both training and inference, motivated by scalability and efficiency extensions to the realm of high-performance computing (HPC).</description>

      <title>Learning Infinitesimal Generators of Continuous Symmetries from Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploiting symmetry inherent in data can significantly improve the sample efficiency of a learning procedure and the generalization of learned models. When data clearly reveals underlying symmetry, leveraging this symmetry can naturally inform the design of model architectures or learning strategies. Yet, in numerous real-world scenarios, identifying the specific symmetry within a given data distribution often proves ambiguous. To tackle this, some existing works learn symmetry in a data-driven manner, parameterizing and learning expected symmetry through data. However, these methods often rely on explicit knowledge, such as pre-defined Lie groups, which are typically restricted to linear or affine transformations. In this paper, we propose a novel symmetry learning algorithm based on transformations defined with one-parameter groups, continuously parameterized transformations flowing along the directions of vector fields called infinitesimal generators. Our method is built upon minimal inductive biases, encompassing not only commonly utilized symmetries rooted in Lie groups but also extending to symmetries derived from nonlinear generators. To learn these symmetries, we introduce a notion of a validity score that examine whether the transformed data is still valid for the given task. The validity score is designed to be fully differentiable and easily computable, enabling effective searches for transformations that achieve symmetries innate to the data. We apply our method mainly in two domains: image data and partial differential equations, and demonstrate its advantages.

      <title>DECRL: A Deep Evolutionary Clustering Jointed Temporal Knowledge Graph Representation Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) representation learning aims to map temporal evolving entities and relations to embedded representations in a continuous low-dimensional vector space. However, existing approaches cannot capture the temporal evolution of high-order correlations in TKGs. To this end, we propose a Deep Evolutionary Clustering jointed temporal knowledge graph Representation Learning approach (DECRL). Specifically, a deep evolutionary clustering module is proposed to capture the temporal evolution of high-order correlations among entities. Furthermore, a cluster-aware unsupervised alignment mechanism is introduced to ensure the precise one-to-one alignment of soft overlapping clusters across timestamps, thereby maintaining the temporal smoothness of clusters. In addition, an implicit correlation encoder is introduced to capture latent correlations between any pair of clusters under the guidance of a global graph. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that DECRL achieves the state-of-the-art performances, outperforming the best baseline by an average of 9.53%, 12.98%, 10.42%, and 14.68% in MRR, Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10, respectively.</description>

Abstract: Particle collisions at accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, recorded and analyzed by experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, enable exquisite measurements of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. Simulations of collision events at these detectors have played a pivotal role in shaping the design of future experiments and analyzing ongoing ones. However, the quest for accuracy in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collisions comes at an imposing computational cost, with projections estimating the need for millions of CPU-years annually during the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run \cite{collaboration2022atlas}. Simulating a single LHC event with \textsc{Geant4} currently devours around 1000 CPU seconds, with simulations of the calorimeter subdetectors in particular imposing substantial computational demands \cite{rousseau2023experimental}. To address this challenge, we propose a conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative model. Our model integrates a conditioned variational autoencoder (VAE) on the exterior with a conditioned Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in the latent space, providing enhanced expressiveness compared to conventional VAEs. The RBM nodes and connections are meticulously engineered to enable the use of qubits and couplers on D-Wave's Pegasus-structured \textit{Advantage} quantum annealer (QA) for sampling. We introduce a novel method for conditioning the quantum-assisted RBM using \textit{flux biases}. We further propose a novel adaptive mapping to estimate the effective inverse temperature in quantum annealers. The effectiveness of our framework is illustrated using Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge \cite{calochallenge}.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Spurious Correlations via Disagreement Probability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) are prone to be biased towards spurious correlations between target labels and bias attributes, which leads to poor performance on data groups lacking spurious correlations. It is particularly challenging to address this problem when access to bias labels is not permitted. To mitigate the effect of spurious correlations without bias labels, we first introduce a novel training objective designed to robustly enhance model performance across all data samples, irrespective of the presence of spurious correlations. From this objective, we then derive a debiasing method, Disagreement Probability based Resampling for debiasing (DPR), which does not require bias labels. DPR leverages the disagreement between the target label and the prediction of a biased model to identify bias-conflicting samples-those without spurious correlations-and upsamples them according to the disagreement probability. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DPR achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines that do not use bias labels. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis that details how DPR reduces dependency on spurious correlations.</description>

      <title>Explanations that reveal all through the definition of encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature attributions attempt to highlight what inputs drive predictive power. Good attributions or explanations are thus those that produce inputs that retain this predictive power; accordingly, evaluations of explanations score their quality of prediction. However, evaluations produce scores better than what appears possible from the values in the explanation for a class of explanations, called encoding explanations. Probing for encoding remains a challenge because there is no general characterization of what gives the extra predictive power. We develop a definition of encoding that identifies this extra predictive power via conditional dependence and show that the definition fits existing examples of encoding. This definition implies, in contrast to encoding explanations, that non-encoding explanations contain all the informative inputs used to produce the explanation, giving them a "what you see is what you get" property, which makes them transparent and simple to use. Next, we prove that existing scores (ROAR, FRESH, EVAL-X) do not rank non-encoding explanations above encoding ones, and develop STRIPE-X which ranks them correctly. After empirically demonstrating the theoretical insights, we use STRIPE-X to show that despite prompting an LLM to produce non-encoding explanations for a sentiment analysis task, the LLM-generated explanations encode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although quantization for linear layers has been widely used, its application to accelerate the attention process remains limited. To further enhance the efficiency of attention computation compared to SageAttention while maintaining precision, we propose SageAttention2, which utilizes significantly faster 4-bit matrix multiplication (Matmul) alongside additional precision-enhancing techniques. First, we propose to quantize matrixes $(Q, K)$ to INT4 in a hardware-friendly thread-level granularity and quantize matrixes $(\widetilde P, V)$ to FP8. Second, we propose a method to smooth $Q$, enhancing the accuracy of INT4 $QK$. Third, we propose to use an FP32 Matmul buffer for $PV$ to enhance the accuracy of FP8 $\widetilde PV$. The operations per second (OPS) of SageAttention2 surpass FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 3x and 5x on RTX4090, respectively. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs negligible end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for large language processing, image generation, and video generation.

      <title>Task Adaptation of Reinforcement Learning-based NAS Agents through Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a novel paradigm has been proposed for reinforcement learning-based NAS agents, that revolves around the incremental improvement of a given architecture. We assess the abilities of such reinforcement learning agents to transfer between different tasks. We perform our evaluation using the Trans-NASBench-101 benchmark, and consider the efficacy of the transferred agents, as well as how quickly they can be trained. We find that pretraining an agent on one task benefits the performance of the agent in another task in all but 1 task when considering final performance. We also show that the training procedure for an agent can be shortened significantly by pretraining it on another task. Our results indicate that these effects occur regardless of the source or target task, although they are more pronounced for some tasks than for others. Our results show that transfer learning can be an effective tool in mitigating the computational cost of the initial training procedure for reinforcement learning-based NAS agents.</description>

      <title>Sometimes I am a Tree: Data Drives Unstable Hierarchical Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language models (LMs), like other neural networks, often favor shortcut heuristics based on surface-level patterns. Although LMs behave like n-gram models early in training, they must eventually learn hierarchical syntactic representations to correctly apply grammatical rules out-of-distribution (OOD). In this work, we use case studies of English grammar to explore how complex, diverse training data drives models to generalize OOD. We construct a framework that unifies our understanding of random variation with training dynamics, rule selection with memorization, and data diversity with complexity. We show that these factors are nuanced, and that intermediate levels of diversity and complexity lead to inconsistent behavior across random seeds and to unstable training dynamics. Our findings emphasize the critical role of training data in shaping generalization patterns and illuminate how competing model strategies lead to inconsistent generalization outcomes across random seeds.

      <title>S$^{2}$FT: Efficient, Scalable and Generalizable LLM Fine-tuning by Structured Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current PEFT methods for LLMs can achieve either high quality, efficient training, or scalable serving, but not all three simultaneously. To address this limitation, we investigate sparse fine-tuning and observe a remarkable improvement in generalization ability. Utilizing this key insight, we propose a family of Structured Sparse Fine-Tuning (S$^{2}$FT) methods for LLMs, which concurrently achieve state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance, training efficiency, and inference scalability. S$^{2}$FT accomplishes this by "selecting sparsely and computing densely". It selects a few heads and channels in the MHA and FFN modules for each Transformer block, respectively. Next, it co-permutes weight matrices on both sides of the coupled structures in LLMs to connect the selected components in each layer into a dense submatrix. Finally, S$^{2}$FT performs in-place gradient updates on all submatrices. Through theoretical analysis and empirical results, our method prevents forgetting while simplifying optimization, delivers SOTA performance on both commonsense and arithmetic reasoning with 4.6% and 1.3% average improvements compared to LoRA, and surpasses full FT by 11.5% when generalizing to various domains after instruction tuning. Using our partial backpropagation algorithm, S$^{2}$FT saves training memory up to 3$\times$ and improves latency by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to full FT, while delivering an average 10% improvement over LoRA on both metrics. We further demonstrate that the weight updates in S$^{2}$FT can be decoupled into adapters, enabling effective fusion, fast switch, and efficient parallelism for serving multiple fine-tuned models.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Personalized Federated Learning through Adaptive Layer-Wise Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-life deployment of federated Learning (FL) often faces non-IID data, which leads to poor accuracy and slow convergence. Personalized FL (pFL) tackles these issues by tailoring local models to individual data sources and using weighted aggregation methods for client-specific learning. However, existing pFL methods often fail to provide each local model with global knowledge on demand while maintaining low computational overhead. Additionally, local models tend to over-personalize their data during the training process, potentially dropping previously acquired global information. We propose FLAYER, a novel layer-wise learning method for pFL that optimizes local model personalization performance. FLAYER considers the different roles and learning abilities of neural network layers of individual local models. It incorporates global information for each local model as needed to initialize the local model cost-effectively. It then dynamically adjusts learning rates for each layer during local training, optimizing the personalized learning process for each local model while preserving global knowledge. Additionally, to enhance global representation in pFL, FLAYER selectively uploads parameters for global aggregation in a layer-wise manner. We evaluate FLAYER on four representative datasets in computer vision and natural language processing domains. Compared to six state-of-the-art pFL methods, FLAYER improves the inference accuracy, on average, by 7.21\% (up to 14.29\%).</description>

      <title>DG-Mamba: Robust and Efficient Dynamic Graph Structure Learning with Selective State Space Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08160v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic graphs exhibit intertwined spatio-temporal evolutionary patterns, widely existing in the real world. Nevertheless, the structure incompleteness, noise, and redundancy result in poor robustness for Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs). Dynamic Graph Structure Learning (DGSL) offers a promising way to optimize graph structures. However, aside from encountering unacceptable quadratic complexity, it overly relies on heuristic priors, making it hard to discover underlying predictive patterns. How to efficiently refine the dynamic structures, capture intrinsic dependencies, and learn robust representations, remains under-explored. In this work, we propose the novel DG-Mamba, a robust and efficient Dynamic Graph structure learning framework with the Selective State Space Models (Mamba). To accelerate the spatio-temporal structure learning, we propose a kernelized dynamic message-passing operator that reduces the quadratic time complexity to linear. To capture global intrinsic dynamics, we establish the dynamic graph as a self-contained system with State Space Model. By discretizing the system states with the cross-snapshot graph adjacency, we enable the long-distance dependencies capturing with the selective snapshot scan. To endow learned dynamic structures more expressive with informativeness, we propose the self-supervised Principle of Relevant Information for DGSL to regularize the most relevant yet least redundant information, enhancing global robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the robustness and efficiency of our DG-Mamba compared with the state-of-the-art baselines against adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>How Does the Smoothness Approximation Method Facilitate Generalization for Federated Adversarial Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Adversarial Learning (FAL) is a robust framework for resisting adversarial attacks on federated learning. Although some FAL studies have developed efficient algorithms, they primarily focus on convergence performance and overlook generalization. Generalization is crucial for evaluating algorithm performance on unseen data. However, generalization analysis is more challenging due to non-smooth adversarial loss functions. A common approach to addressing this issue is to leverage smoothness approximation. In this paper, we develop algorithm stability measures to evaluate the generalization performance of two popular FAL algorithms: \textit{Vanilla FAL (VFAL)} and {\it Slack FAL (SFAL)}, using three different smooth approximation methods: 1) \textit{Surrogate Smoothness Approximation (SSA)}, (2) \textit{Randomized Smoothness Approximation (RSA)}, and (3) \textit{Over-Parameterized Smoothness Approximation (OPSA)}. Based on our in-depth analysis, we answer the question of how to properly set the smoothness approximation method to mitigate generalization error in FAL. Moreover, we identify RSA as the most effective method for reducing generalization error. In highly data-heterogeneous scenarios, we also recommend employing SFAL to mitigate the deterioration of generalization performance caused by heterogeneity. Based on our theoretical results, we provide insights to help develop more efficient FAL algorithms, such as designing new metrics and dynamic aggregation rules to mitigate heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Grimm: A Plug-and-Play Perturbation Rectifier for Graph Neural Networks Defending against Poisoning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of graph neural networks (GNNs) to adversarial poisoning attacks on node classification tasks. Current defensive methods require substituting the original GNNs with defense models, regardless of the original's type. This approach, while targeting adversarial robustness, compromises the enhancements developed in prior research to boost GNNs' practical performance. Here we introduce Grimm, the first plug-and-play defense model. With just a minimal interface requirement for extracting features from any layer of the protected GNNs, Grimm is thus enabled to seamlessly rectify perturbations. Specifically, we utilize the feature trajectories (FTs) generated by GNNs, as they evolve through epochs, to reflect the training status of the networks. We then theoretically prove that the FTs of victim nodes will inevitably exhibit discriminable anomalies. Consequently, inspired by the natural parallelism between the biological nervous and immune systems, we construct Grimm, a comprehensive artificial immune system for GNNs. Grimm not only detects abnormal FTs and rectifies adversarial edges during training but also operates efficiently in parallel, thereby mirroring the concurrent functionalities of its biological counterparts. We experimentally confirm that Grimm offers four empirically validated advantages: 1) Harmlessness, as it does not actively interfere with GNN training; 2) Parallelism, ensuring monitoring, detection, and rectification functions operate independently of the GNN training process; 3) Generalizability, demonstrating compatibility with mainstream GNNs such as GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE; and 4) Transferability, as the detectors for abnormal FTs can be efficiently transferred across different systems for one-step rectification.</description>

      <title>Optimized Gradient Clipping for Noisy Label Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous research has shown that constraining the gradient of loss function with respect to model-predicted probabilities can enhance the model robustness against noisy labels. These methods typically specify a fixed optimal threshold for gradient clipping through validation data to obtain the desired robustness against noise. However, this common practice overlooks the dynamic distribution of gradients from both clean and noisy-labeled samples at different stages of training, significantly limiting the model capability to adapt to the variable nature of gradients throughout the training process. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach called Optimized Gradient Clipping (OGC), which dynamically adjusts the clipping threshold based on the ratio of noise gradients to clean gradients after clipping, estimated by modeling the distributions of clean and noisy samples. This approach allows us to modify the clipping threshold at each training step, effectively controlling the influence of noise gradients. Additionally, we provide statistical analysis to certify the noise-tolerance ability of OGC. Our extensive experiments across various types of label noise, including symmetric, asymmetric, instance-dependent, and real-world noise, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>How to Re-enable PDE Loss for Physical Systems Modeling Under Partial Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In science and engineering, machine learning techniques are increasingly successful in physical systems modeling (predicting future states of physical systems). Effectively integrating PDE loss as a constraint of system transition can improve the model's prediction by overcoming generalization issues due to data scarcity, especially when data acquisition is costly. However, in many real-world scenarios, due to sensor limitations, the data we can obtain is often only partial observation, making the calculation of PDE loss seem to be infeasible, as the PDE loss heavily relies on high-resolution states. We carefully study this problem and propose a novel framework named Re-enable PDE Loss under Partial Observation (RPLPO). The key idea is that although enabling PDE loss to constrain system transition solely is infeasible, we can re-enable PDE loss by reconstructing the learnable high-resolution state and constraining system transition simultaneously. Specifically, RPLPO combines an encoding module for reconstructing learnable high-resolution states with a transition module for predicting future states. The two modules are jointly trained by data and PDE loss. We conduct experiments in various physical systems to demonstrate that RPLPO has significant improvement in generalization, even when observation is sparse, irregular, noisy, and PDE is inaccurate.</description>

Abstract: Structure determination is essential to a mechanistic understanding of diseases and the development of novel therapeutics. Machine-learning-based structure prediction methods have made significant advancements by computationally predicting protein and bioassembly structures from sequences and molecular topology alone. Despite substantial progress in the field, challenges remain to deliver structure prediction models to real-world drug discovery. Here, we present NeuralPLexer3 -- a physics-inspired flow-based generative model that achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy on key biomolecular interaction types and improves training and sampling efficiency compared to its predecessors and alternative methodologies. Examined through newly developed benchmarking strategies, NeuralPLexer3 excels in vital areas that are crucial to structure-based drug design, such as physical validity and ligand-induced conformational changes.</description>

      <title>TrimLLM: Progressive Layer Dropping for Domain-Specific LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Specializing large language models (LLMs) for local deployment in domain-specific use cases is necessary for strong performance while meeting latency and privacy constraints. However, conventional task-specific adaptation approaches do not show simultaneous memory saving and inference speedup at deployment time. Practical compression techniques like quantization and pruning require dedicated hardware or kernel support to achieve measured inference speedup. We develop TrimLLM based on the layer-wise specialization phenomenon we empirically observed and verified on contemporary LLMs. TrimLLM reduces the depth of LLMs via progressive layer dropping. We show it retains LLMs' capacity in specific domains and achieves inference speedup irrespective of hardware and deep learning frameworks. We evaluated TrimLLM on LLMs of various sizes for inference; models adapted on medical, legal, and financial datasets all demonstrate $2.1-5.7\times$ inference speedup on consumer GPUs and up to $3.1\times$ speedup on A100 when compared to state-of-the-art model compression algorithms, with no loss in accuracy at 50$\sim$60\% model compression ratio.</description>

      <title>TRAIL: Trust-Aware Client Scheduling for Semi-Decentralized Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the sensitivity of data, Federated Learning (FL) is employed to enable distributed machine learning while safeguarding data privacy and accommodating the requirements of various devices. However, in the context of semi-decentralized FL, clients' communication and training states are dynamic. This variability arises from local training fluctuations, heterogeneous data distributions, and intermittent client participation. Most existing studies primarily focus on stable client states, neglecting the dynamic challenges inherent in real-world scenarios. To tackle this issue, we propose a TRust-Aware clIent scheduLing mechanism called TRAIL, which assesses client states and contributions, enhancing model training efficiency through selective client participation. We focus on a semi-decentralized FL framework where edge servers and clients train a shared global model using unreliable intra-cluster model aggregation and inter-cluster model consensus. First, we propose an adaptive hidden semi-Markov model to estimate clients' communication states and contributions. Next, we address a client-server association optimization problem to minimize global training loss. Using convergence analysis, we propose a greedy client scheduling algorithm. Finally, our experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that TRAIL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an improvement of 8.7% in test accuracy and a reduction of 15.3% in training loss.</description>

      <title>THESAURUS: Contrastive Graph Clustering by Swapping Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph node clustering is a fundamental unsupervised task. Existing methods typically train an encoder through selfsupervised learning and then apply K-means to the encoder output. Some methods use this clustering result directly as the final assignment, while others initialize centroids based on this initial clustering and then finetune both the encoder and these learnable centroids. However, due to their reliance on K-means, these methods inherit its drawbacks when the cluster separability of encoder output is low, facing challenges from the Uniform Effect and Cluster Assimilation. We summarize three reasons for the low cluster separability in existing methods: (1) lack of contextual information prevents discrimination between similar nodes from different clusters; (2) training tasks are not sufficiently aligned with the downstream clustering task; (3) the cluster information in the graph structure is not appropriately exploited. To address these issues, we propose conTrastive grapH clustEring by SwApping fUsed gRomov-wasserstein coUplingS (THESAURUS). Our method introduces semantic prototypes to provide contextual information, and employs a cross-view assignment prediction pretext task that aligns well with the downstream clustering task. Additionally, it utilizes Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (GW-OT) along with the proposed prototype graph to thoroughly exploit cluster information in the graph structure. To adapt to diverse real-world data, THESAURUS updates the prototype graph and the prototype marginal distribution in OT by using momentum. Extensive experiments demonstrate that THESAURUS achieves higher cluster separability than the prior art, effectively mitigating the Uniform Effect and Cluster Assimilation issues</description>

      <title>Smoothness Really Matters: A Simple Yet Effective Approach for Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) seeks to bridge distribution shifts between domains by transferring knowledge from labeled source graphs to given unlabeled target graphs. Existing UGDA methods primarily focus on aligning features in the latent space learned by graph neural networks (GNNs) across domains, often overlooking structural shifts, resulting in limited effectiveness when addressing structurally complex transfer scenarios. Given the sensitivity of GNNs to local structural features, even slight discrepancies between source and target graphs could lead to significant shifts in node embeddings, thereby reducing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach for UGDA called Target-Domain Structural Smoothing (TDSS). TDSS is a simple and effective method designed to perform structural smoothing directly on the target graph, thereby mitigating structural distribution shifts and ensuring the consistency of node representations. Specifically, by integrating smoothing techniques with neighborhood sampling, TDSS maintains the structural coherence of the target graph while mitigating the risk of over-smoothing. Our theoretical analysis shows that TDSS effectively reduces target risk by improving model smoothness. Empirical results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that TDSS outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant improvements across six transfer scenarios. The code is available in https://github.com/cwei01/TDSS.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Group Classification with Descending Soft Labeling for Deep Imbalanced Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep imbalanced regression (DIR), where the target values have a highly skewed distribution and are also continuous, is an intriguing yet under-explored problem in machine learning.
  While recent works have already shown that incorporating various classification-based regularizers can produce enhanced outcomes, the role of classification remains elusive in DIR.
  Moreover, such regularizers (e.g., contrastive penalties) merely focus on learning discriminative features of data, which inevitably results in ignorance of either continuity or similarity across the data.
  To address these issues, we first bridge the connection between the objectives of DIR and classification from a Bayesian perspective.
  Consequently, this motivates us to decompose the objective of DIR into a combination of classification and regression tasks, which naturally guides us toward a divide-and-conquer manner to solve the DIR problem.
  Specifically, by aggregating the data at nearby labels into the same groups, we introduce an ordinal group-aware contrastive learning loss along with a multi-experts regressor to tackle the different groups of data thereby maintaining the data continuity.
  Meanwhile, considering the similarity between the groups, we also propose a symmetric descending soft labeling strategy to exploit the intrinsic similarity across the data, which allows classification to facilitate regression more effectively.
  Extensive experiments on real-world datasets also validate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Multi-view Granular-ball Contrastive Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous multi-view contrastive learning methods typically operate at two scales: instance-level and cluster-level. Instance-level approaches construct positive and negative pairs based on sample correspondences, aiming to bring positive pairs closer and push negative pairs further apart in the latent space. Cluster-level methods focus on calculating cluster assignments for samples under each view and maximize view consensus by reducing distribution discrepancies, e.g., minimizing KL divergence or maximizing mutual information. However, these two types of methods either introduce false negatives, leading to reduced model discriminability, or overlook local structures and cannot measure relationships between clusters across views explicitly. To this end, we propose a method named Multi-view Granular-ball Contrastive Clustering (MGBCC). MGBCC segments the sample set into coarse-grained granular balls, and establishes associations between intra-view and cross-view granular balls. These associations are reinforced in a shared latent space, thereby achieving multi-granularity contrastive learning. Granular balls lie between instances and clusters, naturally preserving the local topological structure of the sample set. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Online MDP with Transition Prototypes: A Robust Adaptive Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider an online robust Markov Decision Process (MDP) where we have the information of finitely many prototypes of the underlying transition kernel. We consider an adaptively updated ambiguity set of the prototypes and propose an algorithm that efficiently identifies the true underlying transition kernel while guaranteeing the performance of the corresponding robust policy. To be more specific, we provide a sublinear regret of the subsequent optimal robust policy. We also provide an early stopping mechanism and a worst-case performance bound of the value function. In numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, particularly in the early stage with limited data. This work contributes to robust MDPs by considering possible prior information about the underlying transition probability and online learning, offering both theoretical insights and practical algorithms for improved decision-making under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>MAPFAST: A Deep Algorithm Selector for Multi Agent Path Finding using Shortest Path Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.12461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving the Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem optimally is known to be NP-Hard for both make-span and total arrival time minimization. While many algorithms have been developed to solve MAPF problems, there is no dominating optimal MAPF algorithm that works well in all types of problems and no standard guidelines for when to use which algorithm. In this work, we develop the deep convolutional network MAPFAST (Multi-Agent Path Finding Algorithm SelecTor), which takes a MAPF problem instance and attempts to select the fastest algorithm to use from a portfolio of algorithms. We improve the performance of our model by including single-agent shortest paths in the instance embedding given to our model and by utilizing supplemental loss functions in addition to a classification loss. We evaluate our model on a large and diverse dataset of MAPF instances, showing that it outperforms all individual algorithms in its portfolio as well as the state-of-the-art optimal MAPF algorithm selector. We also provide an analysis of algorithm behavior in our dataset to gain a deeper understanding of optimal MAPF algorithms' strengths and weaknesses to help other researchers leverage different heuristics in algorithm designs.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Non-Intrusive Multi-Objective Speech Assessment Model with Cross-Domain Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.02363v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a cross-domain multi-objective speech assessment model called MOSA-Net, which can estimate multiple speech assessment metrics simultaneously. Experimental results show that MOSA-Net can improve the linear correlation coefficient (LCC) by 0.026 (0.990 vs 0.964 in seen noise environments) and 0.012 (0.969 vs 0.957 in unseen noise environments) in perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) prediction, compared to Quality-Net, an existing single-task model for PESQ prediction, and improve LCC by 0.021 (0.985 vs 0.964 in seen noise environments) and 0.047 (0.836 vs 0.789 in unseen noise environments) in short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) prediction, compared to STOI-Net (based on CRNN), an existing single-task model for STOI prediction. Moreover, MOSA-Net, originally trained to assess objective scores, can be used as a pre-trained model to be effectively adapted to an assessment model for predicting subjective quality and intelligibility scores with a limited amount of training data. Experimental results show that MOSA-Net can improve LCC by 0.018 (0.805 vs 0.787) in mean opinion score (MOS) prediction, compared to MOS-SSL, a strong single-task model for MOS prediction. In light of the confirmed prediction capability, we further adopt the latent representations of MOSA-Net to guide the speech enhancement (SE) process and derive a quality-intelligibility (QI)-aware SE (QIA-SE) approach accordingly. Experimental results show that QIA-SE provides superior enhancement performance compared with the baseline SE system in terms of objective evaluation metrics and qualitative evaluation test. For example, QIA-SE can improve PESQ by 0.301 (2.953 vs 2.652 in seen noise environments) and 0.18 (2.658 vs 2.478 in unseen noise environments) over a CNN-based baseline SE model.</description>

      <title>Holdouts set for safe predictive model updating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06374v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictive risk scores for adverse outcomes are increasingly crucial in guiding health interventions. Such scores may need to be periodically updated due to change in the distributions they model. However, directly updating risk scores used to guide intervention can lead to biased risk estimates. To address this, we propose updating using a `holdout set' - a subset of the population that does not receive interventions guided by the risk score. Balancing the holdout set size is essential to ensure good performance of the updated risk score whilst minimising the number of held out samples. We prove that this approach reduces adverse outcome frequency to an asymptotically optimal level and argue that often there is no competitive alternative. We describe conditions under which an optimal holdout size (OHS) can be readily identified, and introduce parametric and semi-parametric algorithms for OHS estimation. We apply our methods to the ASPRE risk score for pre-eclampsia to recommend a plan for updating it in the presence of change in the underlying data distribution. We show that, in order to minimise the number of pre-eclampsia cases over time, this is best achieved using a holdout set of around 10,000 individuals.</description>

      <title>Metric Compatible Training for Online Backfilling in Large-Scale Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backfilling is the process of re-extracting all gallery embeddings from upgraded models in image retrieval systems. It inevitably requires a prohibitively large amount of computational cost and even entails the downtime of the service. Although backward-compatible learning sidesteps this challenge by tackling query-side representations, this leads to suboptimal solutions in principle because gallery embeddings cannot benefit from model upgrades. We address this dilemma by introducing an online backfilling algorithm, which enables us to achieve a progressive performance improvement during the backfilling process while not sacrificing the final performance of new model after the completion of backfilling. To this end, we first propose a simple distance rank merge technique for online backfilling. Then, we incorporate a reverse transformation module for more effective and efficient merging, which is further enhanced by adopting a metric-compatible contrastive learning approach. These two components help to make the distances of old and new models compatible, resulting in desirable merge results during backfilling with no extra computational overhead. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our framework on four standard benchmarks in various settings.</description>

      <title>Mixed Semi-Supervised Generalized-Linear-Regression with Applications to Deep-Learning and Interpolators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09526v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a methodology for using unlabeled data to design semi supervised learning (SSL) methods that improve the prediction performance of supervised learning for regression tasks. The main idea is to design different mechanisms for integrating the unlabeled data, and include in each of them a mixing parameter $\alpha$, controlling the weight given to the unlabeled data. Focusing on Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and linear interpolators classes of models, we analyze the characteristics of different mixing mechanisms, and prove that in all cases, it is invariably beneficial to integrate the unlabeled data with some nonzero mixing ratio $\alpha&gt;0$, in terms of predictive performance. Moreover, we provide a rigorous framework to estimate the best mixing ratio $\alpha^*$ where mixed SSL delivers the best predictive performance, while using the labeled and unlabeled data on hand.
  The effectiveness of our methodology in delivering substantial improvement compared to the standard supervised models, in a variety of settings, is demonstrated empirically through extensive simulation, in a manner that supports the theoretical analysis. We also demonstrate the applicability of our methodology (with some intuitive modifications) to improve more complex models, such as deep neural networks, in real-world regression tasks.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Damage Detection in Fiber Lifting Ropes Using Lightweight Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The health and safety hazards posed by worn crane lifting ropes mandate periodic inspection for damage. This task is time-consuming, prone to human error, halts operation, and may result in the premature disposal of ropes. Therefore, we propose using efficient deep learning and computer vision methods to automate the process of detecting damaged ropes. Specifically, we present a vision-based system for detecting damage in synthetic fiber rope images using lightweight convolutional neural networks. We develop a camera-based apparatus to photograph the lifting rope's surface, while in operation, and capture the progressive wear-and-tear as well as the more significant degradation in the rope's health state. Experts from Konecranes annotate the collected images in accordance with the rope's condition; normal or damaged. Then, we pre-process the images, systematically design a deep learning model, evaluate its detection and prediction performance, analyze its computational complexity, and compare it with various other models. Experimental results show the proposed model outperforms other similar techniques with 96.5% accuracy, 94.8% precision, 98.3% recall, 96.5% F1-score, and 99.3% AUC. Besides, they demonstrate the model's real-time operation, low memory footprint, robustness to various environmental and operational conditions, and adequacy for deployment in industrial applications such as lifting, mooring, towing, climbing, and sailing.</description>

      <title>Toward Falsifying Causal Graphs Using a Permutation-Based Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding causal relationships among the variables of a system is paramount to explain and control its behavior. For many real-world systems, however, the true causal graph is not readily available and one must resort to predictions made by algorithms or domain experts. Therefore, metrics that quantitatively assess the goodness of a causal graph provide helpful checks before using it in downstream tasks. Existing metrics provide an $\textit{absolute}$ number of inconsistencies between the graph and the observed data, and without a baseline, practitioners are left to answer the hard question of how many such inconsistencies are acceptable or expected. Here, we propose a novel consistency metric by constructing a baseline through node permutations. By comparing the number of inconsistencies with those on the baseline, we derive an interpretable metric that captures whether the graph is significantly better than random. Evaluating on both simulated and real data sets from various domains, including biology and cloud monitoring, we demonstrate that the true graph is not falsified by our metric, whereas the wrong graphs given by a hypothetical user are likely to be falsified.</description>

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence in drug discovery encounters challenges with generalization and extensive training, yet Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise in reshaping interactions with complex molecular data. Our novel contribution, InstructMol, a multi-modal LLM, effectively aligns molecular structures with natural language via an instruction-tuning approach, utilizing a two-stage training strategy that adeptly combines limited domain-specific data with molecular and textual information.

      <title>Union-over-Intersections: Object Detection beyond Winner-Takes-All</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper revisits the problem of predicting box locations in object detection architectures. Typically, each box proposal or box query aims to directly maximize the intersection-over-union score with the ground truth, followed by a winner-takes-all non-maximum suppression where only the highest scoring box in each region is retained. We observe that both steps are sub-optimal: the first involves regressing proposals to the entire ground truth, which is a difficult task even with large receptive fields, and the second neglects valuable information from boxes other than the top candidate. Instead of regressing proposals to the whole ground truth, we propose a simpler approach: regress only to the area of intersection between the proposal and the ground truth. This avoids the need for proposals to extrapolate beyond their visual scope, improving localization accuracy. Rather than adopting a winner-takes-all strategy, we take the union over the regressed intersections of all boxes in a region to generate the final box outputs. Our plug-and-play method integrates seamlessly into proposal-based, grid-based, and query-based detection architectures with minimal modifications, consistently improving object localization and instance segmentation. We demonstrate its broad applicability and versatility across various detection and segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Polynomial Separations in Trainable Quantum Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical results in quantum machine learning have demonstrated a general trade-off between the expressive power of quantum neural networks (QNNs) and their trainability; as a corollary of these results, practical exponential separations in expressive power over classical machine learning models are believed to be infeasible as such QNNs take a time to train that is exponential in the model size. We here circumvent these negative results by constructing a hierarchy of efficiently trainable QNNs that exhibit unconditionally provable, polynomial memory separations of arbitrary constant degree over classical neural networks -- including state-of-the-art models, such as Transformers -- in performing a classical sequence modeling task. This construction is also computationally efficient, as each unit cell of the introduced class of QNNs only has constant gate complexity. We show that contextuality -- informally, a quantitative notion of semantic ambiguity -- is the source of the expressivity separation, suggesting that other learning tasks with this property may be a natural setting for the use of quantum learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>CAP: A General Algorithm for Online Selective Conformal Prediction with FCR Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of post-selection predictive inference in an online fashion. To avoid devoting resources to unimportant units, a preliminary selection of the current individual before reporting its prediction interval is common and meaningful in online predictive tasks. Since the online selection causes a temporal multiplicity in the selected prediction intervals, it is important to control the real-time false coverage-statement rate (FCR) which measures the overall miscoverage level. We develop a general framework named CAP (Calibration after Adaptive Pick) that performs an adaptive pick rule on historical data to construct a calibration set if the current individual is selected and then outputs a conformal prediction interval for the unobserved label. We provide tractable procedures for constructing the calibration set for popular online selection rules. We proved that CAP can achieve an exact selection-conditional coverage guarantee in the finite-sample and distribution-free regimes. To account for the distribution shift in online data, we also embed CAP into some recent dynamic conformal prediction algorithms and show that the proposed method can deliver long-run FCR control. Numerical results on both synthetic and real data corroborate that CAP can effectively control FCR around the target level and yield more narrowed prediction intervals over existing baselines across various settings.</description>

      <title>PALM: Pushing Adaptive Learning Rate Mechanisms for Continual Test-Time Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world vision models in dynamic environments face rapid shifts in domain distributions, leading to decreased recognition performance. Using unlabeled test data, continuous test-time adaptation (CTTA) directly adjusts a pre-trained source discriminative model to these changing domains. A highly effective CTTA method involves applying layer-wise adaptive learning rates for selectively adapting pre-trained layers. However, it suffers from the poor estimation of domain shift and the inaccuracies arising from the pseudo-labels. This work aims to overcome these limitations by identifying layers for adaptation via quantifying model prediction uncertainty without relying on pseudo-labels. We utilize the magnitude of gradients as a metric, calculated by backpropagating the KL divergence between the softmax output and a uniform distribution, to select layers for further adaptation. Subsequently, for the parameters exclusively belonging to these selected layers, with the remaining ones frozen, we evaluate their sensitivity to approximate the domain shift and adjust their learning rates accordingly. We conduct extensive image classification experiments on CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, and ImageNet-C, demonstrating the superior efficacy of our method compared to prior approaches.</description>

      <title>Image Classification with Rotation-Invariant Variational Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are gaining attention as an early application of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. One of the main problems of variational methods lies in the phenomenon of Barren Plateaus, present in the optimization of variational parameters. Adding geometric inductive bias to the quantum models has been proposed as a potential solution to mitigate this problem, leading to a new field called Geometric Quantum Machine Learning. In this work, an equivariant architecture for variational quantum classifiers is introduced to create a label-invariant model for image classification with $C_4$ rotational label symmetry. The equivariant circuit is benchmarked against two different architectures, and it is experimentally observed that the geometric approach boosts the model's performance. Finally, a classical equivariant convolution operation is proposed to extend the quantum model for the processing of larger images, employing the resources available in NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>Spectral Motion Alignment for Video Motion Transfer using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of diffusion models has greatly impacted video generation and understanding. Particularly, text-to-video diffusion models (VDMs) have significantly facilitated the customization of input video with target appearance, motion, etc. Despite these advances, challenges persist in accurately distilling motion information from video frames. While existing works leverage the consecutive frame residual as the target motion vector, they inherently lack global motion context and are vulnerable to frame-wise distortions. To address this, we present Spectral Motion Alignment (SMA), a novel framework that refines and aligns motion vectors using Fourier and wavelet transforms. SMA learns motion patterns by incorporating frequency-domain regularization, facilitating the learning of whole-frame global motion dynamics, and mitigating spatial artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate SMA's efficacy in improving motion transfer while maintaining computational efficiency and compatibility across various video customization frameworks.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Consumer IoT Traffic from Security and Privacy Perspectives: a Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT), a notable segment within the IoT domain, involves the integration of IoT technology into consumer electronics and devices, such as smart homes and smart wearables. Compared to traditional IoT fields, CIoT differs notably in target users, product types, and design approaches. While offering convenience to users, it also raises new security and privacy concerns. Network traffic analysis, a widely used technique in the security community, has been extensively applied to investigate these concerns about CIoT. Compared to network traffic analysis in other fields such as mobile apps and websites, CIoT presents unique characteristics, introducing new challenges and research opportunities. Researchers have made significant contributions in this area. To aid researchers in understanding the application of traffic analysis tools for studying CIoT security and privacy risks, this survey reviews 303 publications on traffic analysis within the CIoT security and privacy domain from January 2018 to June 2024, focusing on three research questions. Our work: 1) outlines the CIoT traffic analysis process and highlights its differences from general network traffic analysis. 2) summarizes and classifies existing research into four categories according to its application objectives: device fingerprinting, user activity inference, malicious traffic detection, and measurement. 3) explores emerging challenges and potential future research directions based on each step of the CIoT traffic analysis process. This will provide new insights to the community and guide the industry towards safer product designs.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis Generation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective generation of novel hypotheses is instrumental to scientific progress. So far, researchers have been the main powerhouse behind hypothesis generation by painstaking data analysis and thinking (also known as the Eureka moment). In this paper, we examine the potential of large language models (LLMs) to generate hypotheses. We focus on hypothesis generation based on data (i.e., labeled examples). To enable LLMs to handle arbitrarily long contexts, we generate initial hypotheses from a small number of examples and then update them iteratively to improve the quality of hypotheses. Inspired by multi-armed bandits, we design a reward function to inform the exploitation-exploration tradeoff in the update process. Our algorithm is able to generate hypotheses that enable much better predictive performance than few-shot prompting in classification tasks, improving accuracy by 31.7% on a synthetic dataset and by 13.9%, 3.3% and, 24.9% on three real-world datasets. We also outperform supervised learning by 12.8% and 11.2% on two challenging real-world datasets. Furthermore, we find that the generated hypotheses not only corroborate human-verified theories but also uncover new insights for the tasks.</description>

      <title>Stable Learning Using Spiking Neural Networks Equipped With Affine Encoders and Decoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the learning problem associated with spiking neural networks. Specifically, we focus on spiking neural networks composed of simple spiking neurons having only positive synaptic weights, equipped with an affine encoder and decoder. These neural networks are shown to depend continuously on their parameters, which facilitates classical covering number-based generalization statements and supports stable gradient-based training. We demonstrate that the positivity of the weights continues to enable a wide range of expressivity results, including rate-optimal approximation of smooth functions and dimension-independent approximation of Barron regular functions. In particular, we show in theory and simulations that affine spiking neural networks are capable of approximating shallow ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we apply these neural networks to standard machine learning benchmarks, reaching competitive results. Finally, and remarkably, we observe that from a generalization perspective, contrary to feedforward neural networks or previous results for general spiking neural networks, the depth has little to no adverse effect on the generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Feature selection in linear SVMs via a hard cardinality constraint: a scalable SDP decomposition approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the embedded feature selection problem in linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs), in which a cardinality constraint is employed, leading to an interpretable classification model. The problem is NP-hard due to the presence of the cardinality constraint, even though the original linear SVM amounts to a problem solvable in polynomial time. To handle the hard problem, we first introduce two mixed-integer formulations for which novel semidefinite relaxations are proposed. Exploiting the sparsity pattern of the relaxations, we decompose the problems and obtain equivalent relaxations in a much smaller cone, making the conic approaches scalable. To make the best usage of the decomposed relaxations, we propose heuristics using the information of its optimal solution. Moreover, an exact procedure is proposed by solving a sequence of mixed-integer decomposed semidefinite optimization problems. Numerical results on classical benchmarking datasets are reported, showing the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Online Policy Learning and Inference by Matrix Completion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is it possible to make online decisions when personalized covariates are unavailable? We take a collaborative-filtering approach for decision-making based on collective preferences. By assuming low-dimensional latent features, we formulate the covariate-free decision-making problem as a matrix completion bandit. We propose a policy learning procedure that combines an $\varepsilon$-greedy policy for decision-making with an online gradient descent algorithm for bandit parameter estimation. Our novel two-phase design balances policy learning accuracy and regret performance. For policy inference, we develop an online debiasing method based on inverse propensity weighting and establish its asymptotic normality. Our methods are applied to data from the San Francisco parking pricing project, revealing intriguing discoveries and outperforming the benchmark policy.</description>

      <title>SCONE: A Novel Stochastic Sampling to Generate Contrastive Views and Hard Negative Samples for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph-based collaborative filtering (CF) has emerged as a promising approach in recommender systems. Despite its achievements, graph-based CF models face challenges due to data sparsity and negative sampling. In this paper, we propose a novel Stochastic sampling for i) COntrastive views and ii) hard NEgative samples (SCONE) to overcome these issues. SCONE generates dynamic augmented views and diverse hard negative samples via a unified stochastic sampling approach based on score-based generative models. Our extensive experiments on 6 benchmark datasets show that SCONE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. SCONE shows efficacy in addressing user sparsity and item popularity issues, while enhancing performance for both cold-start users and long-tail items. Furthermore, our approach improves the diversity of the recommendation and the uniformity of the representations. The code is available at https://github.com/jeongwhanchoi/SCONE.</description>

      <title>Agent Planning with World Knowledge Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14205v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent endeavors towards directly using large language models (LLMs) as agent models to execute interactive planning tasks have shown commendable results. Despite their achievements, however, they still struggle with brainless trial-and-error in global planning and generating hallucinatory actions in local planning due to their poor understanding of the ``real'' physical world. Imitating humans' mental world knowledge model which provides global prior knowledge before the task and maintains local dynamic knowledge during the task, in this paper, we introduce parametric World Knowledge Model (WKM) to facilitate agent planning. Concretely, we steer the agent model to self-synthesize knowledge from both expert and sampled trajectories. Then we develop WKM, providing prior task knowledge to guide the global planning and dynamic state knowledge to assist the local planning. Experimental results on three complex real-world simulated datasets with three state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, Mistral-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama-3-8B, demonstrate that our method can achieve superior performance compared to various strong baselines. Besides, we analyze to illustrate that our WKM can effectively alleviate the blind trial-and-error and hallucinatory action issues, providing strong support for the agent's understanding of the world. Other interesting findings include: 1) our instance-level task knowledge can generalize better to unseen tasks, 2) weak WKM can guide strong agent model planning, and 3) unified WKM training has promising potential for further development.

      <title>Iterative Methods for Full-Scale Gaussian Process Approximations for Large Spatial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes are flexible probabilistic regression models which are widely used in statistics and machine learning. However, a drawback is their limited scalability to large data sets. To alleviate this, we consider full-scale approximations (FSAs) that combine predictive process methods and covariance tapering, thus approximating both global and local structures. We show how iterative methods can be used to reduce the computational costs for calculating likelihoods, gradients, and predictive distributions with FSAs. We introduce a novel preconditioner and show that it accelerates the conjugate gradient method's convergence speed and mitigates its sensitivity with respect to the FSA parameters and the eigenvalue structure of the original covariance matrix, and we demonstrate empirically that it outperforms a state-of-the-art pivoted Cholesky preconditioner. Further, we present a novel, accurate, and fast way to calculate predictive variances relying on stochastic estimations and iterative methods. In both simulated and real-world data experiments, we find that our proposed methodology achieves the same accuracy as Cholesky-based computations with a substantial reduction in computational time. Finally, we also compare different approaches for determining inducing points in predictive process and FSA models. All methods are implemented in a free C++ software library with high-level Python and R packages.</description>

      <title>AndroidWorld: A Dynamic Benchmarking Environment for Autonomous Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14573v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents that execute human tasks by controlling computers can enhance human productivity and application accessibility. However, progress in this field will be driven by realistic and reproducible benchmarks. We present AndroidWorld, a fully functional Android environment that provides reward signals for 116 programmatic tasks across 20 real-world Android apps. Unlike existing interactive environments, which provide a static test set, AndroidWorld dynamically constructs tasks that are parameterized and expressed in natural language in unlimited ways, thus enabling testing on a much larger and more realistic suite of tasks. To ensure reproducibility, each task includes dedicated initialization, success-checking, and tear-down logic, which modifies and inspects the device's system state. We experiment with baseline agents to test AndroidWorld and provide initial results on the benchmark. Our best agent can complete 30.6% of AndroidWorld's tasks, leaving ample room for future work. Furthermore, we adapt a popular desktop web agent to work on Android, which we find to be less effective on mobile, suggesting future research is needed to achieve universal, cross-platform agents. Finally, we also conduct a robustness analysis, showing that task variations can significantly affect agent performance, demonstrating that without such testing, agent performance metrics may not fully reflect practical challenges. AndroidWorld and the experiments in this paper are available at github.com/google-research/android_world.</description>

      <title>WISE: Rethinking the Knowledge Memory for Lifelong Model Editing of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) need knowledge updates to meet the ever-growing world facts and correct the hallucinated responses, facilitating the methods of lifelong model editing. Where the updated knowledge resides in memories is a fundamental question for model editing. In this paper, we find that editing either long-term memory (direct model parameters) or working memory (non-parametric knowledge of neural network activations/representations by retrieval) will result in an impossible triangle -- reliability, generalization, and locality can not be realized together in the lifelong editing settings. For long-term memory, directly editing the parameters will cause conflicts with irrelevant pretrained knowledge or previous edits (poor reliability and locality). For working memory, retrieval-based activations can hardly make the model understand the edits and generalize (poor generalization). Therefore, we propose WISE to bridge the gap between memories. In WISE, we design a dual parametric memory scheme, which consists of the main memory for the pretrained knowledge and a side memory for the edited knowledge. We only edit the knowledge in the side memory and train a router to decide which memory to go through when given a query. For continual editing, we devise a knowledge-sharding mechanism where different sets of edits reside in distinct subspaces of parameters, and are subsequently merged into a shared memory without conflicts. Extensive experiments show that WISE can outperform previous model editing methods and overcome the impossible triangle under lifelong model editing of question answering, hallucination, and out-of-distribution settings across trending LLM architectures, e.g., GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral.

      <title>Knowledge Circuits in Pretrained Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large language models are rooted in their vast repositories of knowledge encoded within their parameters, enabling them to perceive the world and engage in reasoning. The inner workings of how these models store knowledge have long been a subject of intense interest and investigation among researchers. To date, most studies have concentrated on isolated components within these models, such as the Multilayer Perceptrons and attention head. In this paper, we delve into the computation graph of the language model to uncover the knowledge circuits that are instrumental in articulating specific knowledge. The experiments, conducted with GPT2 and TinyLLAMA, have allowed us to observe how certain information heads, relation heads, and Multilayer Perceptrons collaboratively encode knowledge within the model. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of current knowledge editing techniques on these knowledge circuits, providing deeper insights into the functioning and constraints of these editing methodologies. Finally, we utilize knowledge circuits to analyze and interpret language model behaviors such as hallucinations and in-context learning. We believe the knowledge circuits hold potential for advancing our understanding of Transformers and guiding the improved design of knowledge editing.

      <title>Guiding a Diffusion Model with a Bad Version of Itself</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary axes of interest in image-generating diffusion models are image quality, the amount of variation in the results, and how well the results align with a given condition, e.g., a class label or a text prompt. The popular classifier-free guidance approach uses an unconditional model to guide a conditional model, leading to simultaneously better prompt alignment and higher-quality images at the cost of reduced variation. These effects seem inherently entangled, and thus hard to control. We make the surprising observation that it is possible to obtain disentangled control over image quality without compromising the amount of variation by guiding generation using a smaller, less-trained version of the model itself rather than an unconditional model. This leads to significant improvements in ImageNet generation, setting record FIDs of 1.01 for 64x64 and 1.25 for 512x512, using publicly available networks. Furthermore, the method is also applicable to unconditional diffusion models, drastically improving their quality.</description>

      <title>Discovering Continuous-Time Memory-Based Symbolic Policies using Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02765v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence techniques are increasingly being applied to solve control problems, but often rely on black-box methods without transparent output generation. To improve the interpretability and transparency in control systems, models can be defined as white-box symbolic policies described by mathematical expressions. For better performance in partially observable and volatile environments, the symbolic policies are extended with memory represented by continuous-time latent variables, governed by differential equations. Genetic programming is used for optimisation, resulting in interpretable policies consisting of symbolic expressions. Our results show that symbolic policies with memory compare with black-box policies on a variety of control tasks. Furthermore, the benefit of the memory in symbolic policies is demonstrated on experiments where memory-less policies fall short. Overall, we present a method for evolving high-performing symbolic policies that offer interpretability and transparency, which lacks in black-box models.</description>

      <title>VisualRWKV: Exploring Recurrent Neural Networks for Visual Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly progressed with the recent success of large language models. However, there have been few attempts to incorporate efficient linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) architectures into VLMs. In this study, we introduce VisualRWKV, the first application of a linear RNN model to multimodal learning tasks, leveraging the pre-trained RWKV language model. We propose a data-dependent recurrence and sandwich prompts to enhance our modeling capabilities, along with a 2D image scanning mechanism to enrich the processing of visual sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VisualRWKV achieves competitive performance compared to Transformer-based models like LLaVA-1.5 on various benchmarks. Compared to LLaVA-1.5, VisualRWKV has a speed advantage of 3.98 times and can save 54% of GPU memory when reaching an inference length of 24K tokens. To facilitate further research and analysis, we have made the checkpoints and the associated code publicly accessible at the following GitHub repository: see https://github.com/howard-hou/VisualRWKV.</description>

      <title>Quantum Curriculum Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02419v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) requires significant quantum resources to address practical real-world problems. When the underlying quantum information exhibits hierarchical structures in the data, limitations persist in training complexity and generalization. Research should prioritize both the efficient design of quantum architectures and the development of learning strategies to optimize resource usage. We propose a framework called quantum curriculum learning (Q-CurL) for quantum data, where the curriculum introduces simpler tasks or data to the learning model before progressing to more challenging ones. Q-CurL exhibits robustness to noise and data limitations, which is particularly relevant for current and near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We achieve this through a curriculum design based on quantum data density ratios and a dynamic learning schedule that prioritizes the most informative quantum data. Empirical evidence shows that Q-CurL significantly enhances training convergence and generalization for unitary learning and improves the robustness of quantum phase recognition tasks. Q-CurL is effective with broad physical learning applications in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Langevin dynamics for high-dimensional optimization: the case of multi-spiked tensor PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonconvex optimization in high dimensions through Langevin dynamics, focusing on the multi-spiked tensor PCA problem. This tensor estimation problem involves recovering $r$ hidden signal vectors (spikes) from noisy Gaussian tensor observations using maximum likelihood estimation. We study the number of samples required for Langevin dynamics to efficiently recover the spikes and determine the necessary separation condition on the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for exact recovery, distinguishing the cases $p \ge 3$ and $p=2$, where $p$ denotes the order of the tensor. In particular, we show that the sample complexity required for recovering the spike associated with the largest SNR matches the well-known algorithmic threshold for the single-spike case, while this threshold degrades when recovering all $r$ spikes. As a key step, we provide a detailed characterization of the trajectory and interactions of low-dimensional projections that capture the high-dimensional dynamics.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Large Language Models for Math Reasoning Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning has become a cornerstone of related research, demonstrating the intelligence of these models and enabling potential practical applications through their advanced performance, such as in educational settings. Despite the variety of datasets and in-context learning algorithms designed to improve the ability of LLMs to automate mathematical problem solving, the lack of comprehensive benchmarking across different datasets makes it complicated to select an appropriate model for specific tasks. In this project, we present a benchmark that fairly compares seven state-of-the-art in-context learning algorithms for mathematical problem solving across five widely used mathematical datasets on four powerful foundation models. Furthermore, we explore the trade-off between efficiency and performance, highlighting the practical applications of LLMs for mathematical reasoning. Our results indicate that larger foundation models like GPT-4o and LLaMA 3-70B can solve mathematical reasoning independently from the concrete prompting strategy, while for smaller models the in-context learning approach significantly influences the performance. Moreover, the optimal prompt depends on the chosen foundation model. We open-source our benchmark code to support the integration of additional models in future research.</description>

      <title>Prompt Compression with Context-Aware Sentence Encoding for Fast and Improved LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have triggered a new stream of research focusing on compressing the context length to reduce the computational cost while ensuring the retention of helpful information for LLMs to answer the given question. Token-based removal methods are one of the most prominent approaches in this direction, but risk losing the semantics of the context caused by intermediate token removal, especially under high compression ratios, while also facing challenges in computational efficiency. In this work, we propose context-aware prompt compression (CPC), a sentence-level prompt compression technique where its key innovation is a novel context-aware sentence encoder that provides a relevance score for each sentence for a given question. To train this encoder, we generate a new dataset consisting of questions, positives, and negative pairs where positives are sentences relevant to the question, while negatives are irrelevant context sentences. We train the encoder in a contrastive setup to learn context-aware sentence representations. Our method considerably outperforms prior works on prompt compression on benchmark datasets and is up to 10.93x faster at inference compared to the best token-level compression method. We also find better improvement for shorter length constraints in most benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of our proposed solution in the compression of relevant information in a shorter context. Finally, we release the code and the dataset for quick reproducibility and further development: https://github.com/Workday/cpc.</description>

      <title>Hybridization of Persistent Homology with Neural Networks for Time-Series Prediction: A Case Study in Wave Height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-series prediction is an active area of research across various fields, often challenged by the fluctuating influence of short-term and long-term factors. In this study, we introduce a feature engineering method that enhances the predictive performance of neural network models. Specifically, we leverage computational topology techniques to derive valuable topological features from input data, boosting the predictive accuracy of our models. Our focus is on predicting wave heights, utilizing models based on topological features within feedforward neural networks (FNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), and RNNs with gated recurrent units (GRU). For time-ahead predictions, the enhancements in $R^2$ score were significant for FNNs, RNNs, LSTM, and GRU models. Additionally, these models also showed significant reductions in maximum errors and mean squared errors.</description>

      <title>Training Datasets Generation for Machine Learning: Application to Vision Based Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Based Navigation consists in utilizing cameras as precision sensors for GNC after extracting information from images. To enable the adoption of machine learning for space applications, one of obstacles is the demonstration that available training datasets are adequate to validate the algorithms. The objective of the study is to generate datasets of images and metadata suitable for training machine learning algorithms. Two use cases were selected and a robust methodology was developed to validate the datasets including the ground truth. The first use case is in-orbit rendezvous with a man-made object: a mockup of satellite ENVISAT. The second use case is a Lunar landing scenario. Datasets were produced from archival datasets (Chang'e 3), from the laboratory at DLR TRON facility and at Airbus Robotic laboratory, from SurRender software high fidelity image simulator using Model Capture and from Generative Adversarial Networks. The use case definition included the selection of algorithms as benchmark: an AI-based pose estimation algorithm and a dense optical flow algorithm were selected. Eventually it is demonstrated that datasets produced with SurRender and selected laboratory facilities are adequate to train machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>URIEL+: Enhancing Linguistic Inclusion and Usability in a Typological and Multilingual Knowledge Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: URIEL is a knowledge base offering geographical, phylogenetic, and typological vector representations for 7970 languages. It includes distance measures between these vectors for 4005 languages, which are accessible via the lang2vec tool. Despite being frequently cited, URIEL is limited in terms of linguistic inclusion and overall usability. To tackle these challenges, we introduce URIEL+, an enhanced version of URIEL and lang2vec that addresses these limitations. In addition to expanding typological feature coverage for 2898 languages, URIEL+ improves the user experience with robust, customizable distance calculations to better suit the needs of users. These upgrades also offer competitive performance on downstream tasks and provide distances that better align with linguistic distance studies.</description>

      <title>Nonstationary Sparse Spectral Permanental Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing permanental processes often impose constraints on kernel types or stationarity, limiting the model's expressiveness. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach utilizing the sparse spectral representation of nonstationary kernels. This technique relaxes the constraints on kernel types and stationarity, allowing for more flexible modeling while reducing computational complexity to the linear level. Additionally, we introduce a deep kernel variant by hierarchically stacking multiple spectral feature mappings, further enhancing the model's expressiveness to capture complex patterns in data. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in scenarios with pronounced data nonstationarity. Additionally, ablation studies are conducted to provide insights into the impact of various hyperparameters on model performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the flavour sector of the supersymmetric $SU(5)$ Grand Unified Theory (GUT) model using machine learning techniques. The minimal $SU(5)$ model is known to predict fermion masses that disagree with observed values in nature. There are two well-known approaches to address this issue: one involves introducing a 45-representation Higgs field, while the other employs a higher-dimensional operator involving the 24-representation GUT Higgs field. We compare these two approaches by numerically optimising a loss function, defined as the ratio of determinants of mass matrices. Our findings indicate that the 24-Higgs approach achieves the observed fermion masses with smaller modifications to the original minimal $SU(5)$ model.</description>

      <title>Self-Generated Critiques Boost Reward Modeling for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reward modeling is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, especially in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, current reward models mainly produce scalar scores and struggle to incorporate critiques in a natural language format. We hypothesize that predicting both critiques and the scalar reward would improve reward modeling ability. Motivated by this, we propose Critic-RM, a framework that improves reward models using self-generated critiques without extra supervision. Critic-RM employs a two-stage process: generating and filtering high-quality critiques, followed by joint fine-tuning on reward prediction and critique generation. Experiments across benchmarks show that Critic-RM improves reward modeling accuracy by 3.7%-7.3% compared to standard reward models and LLM judges, demonstrating strong performance and data efficiency. Additional studies further validate the effectiveness of generated critiques in rectifying flawed reasoning steps with 2.5%-3.2% gains in improving reasoning accuracy.</description>

Abstract: We present an audit mechanism for language models, with a focus on models deployed in the healthcare setting. Our proposed mechanism takes inspiration from clinical trial design where we posit the language model audit as a single blind equivalence trial, with the comparison of interest being the subject matter experts. We show that using our proposed method, we can follow principled sample size and power calculations, leading to the requirement of sampling minimum number of records while maintaining the audit integrity and statistical soundness. Finally, we provide a real-world example of the audit used in a production environment in a large-scale public health network.</description>

      <title>SoK: Watermarking for AI-Generated Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the outputs of generative AI (GenAI) techniques improve in quality, it becomes increasingly challenging to distinguish them from human-created content. Watermarking schemes are a promising approach to address the problem of distinguishing between AI and human-generated content. These schemes embed hidden signals within AI-generated content to enable reliable detection. While watermarking is not a silver bullet for addressing all risks associated with GenAI, it can play a crucial role in enhancing AI safety and trustworthiness by combating misinformation and deception. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of watermarking techniques for GenAI, beginning with the need for watermarking from historical and regulatory perspectives. We formalize the definitions and desired properties of watermarking schemes and examine the key objectives and threat models for existing approaches. Practical evaluation strategies are also explored, providing insights into the development of robust watermarking techniques capable of resisting various attacks. Additionally, we review recent representative works, highlight open challenges, and discuss potential directions for this emerging field. By offering a thorough understanding of watermarking in GenAI, this work aims to guide researchers in advancing watermarking methods and applications, and support policymakers in addressing the broader implications of GenAI.</description>

      <title>The Data-Driven Censored Newsvendor Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a censored variant of the data-driven newsvendor problem, where the decision-maker must select an ordering quantity that minimizes expected overage and underage costs based only on offline censored sales data, rather than historical demand realizations. Our goal is to understand how the degree of historical demand censoring affects the performance of any learning algorithm for this problem. To isolate this impact, we adopt a distributionally robust optimization framework, evaluating policies according to their worst-case regret over an ambiguity set of distributions. This set is defined by the largest historical order quantity (the observable boundary of the dataset), and contains all distributions matching the true demand distribution up to this boundary, while allowing them to be arbitrary afterwards. We demonstrate a spectrum of achievability under demand censoring by deriving a natural necessary and sufficient condition under which vanishing regret is an achievable goal. In regimes in which it is not, we exactly characterize the information loss due to censoring: an insurmountable lower bound on the performance of any policy, even when the decision-maker has access to infinitely many demand samples. We then leverage these sharp characterizations to propose a natural robust algorithm that adapts to the historical level of demand censoring. We derive finite-sample guarantees for this algorithm across all possible censoring regimes and show its near-optimality with matching lower bounds (up to polylogarithmic factors). We moreover demonstrate its robust performance via extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Samudra: An AI Global Ocean Emulator for Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI emulators for forecasting have emerged as powerful tools that can outperform conventional numerical predictions. The next frontier is to build emulators for long climate simulations with skill across a range of spatiotemporal scales, a particularly important goal for the ocean. Our work builds a skillful global emulator of the ocean component of a state-of-the-art climate model. We emulate key ocean variables, sea surface height, horizontal velocities, temperature, and salinity, across their full depth. We use a modified ConvNeXt UNet architecture trained on multidepth levels of ocean data. We show that the ocean emulator - Samudra - which exhibits no drift relative to the truth, can reproduce the depth structure of ocean variables and their interannual variability. Samudra is stable for centuries and 150 times faster than the original ocean model. Samudra struggles to capture the correct magnitude of the forcing trends and simultaneously remains stable, requiring further work.</description>

      <title>When Every Token Counts: Optimal Segmentation for Low-Resource Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional greedy tokenization methods have been a critical step in Natural Language Processing (NLP), influencing how text is converted into tokens and directly impacting model performance. While subword tokenizers like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely used, questions remain about their optimality across model scales and languages. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive experiments that an optimal BPE configuration significantly reduces token count compared to greedy segmentation, yielding improvements in token-saving percentages and performance benefits, particularly for smaller models. We evaluate tokenization performance across various intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, including generation and classification. Our findings suggest that compression-optimized tokenization strategies could provide substantial advantages for multilingual and low-resource language applications, highlighting a promising direction for further research and inclusive NLP.</description>

      <title>RAZOR: Sharpening Knowledge by Cutting Bias with Unsupervised Text Rewriting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the widespread use of LLMs due to their superior performance in various tasks, their high computational costs often lead potential users to opt for the pretraining-finetuning pipeline. However, biases prevalent in manually constructed datasets can introduce spurious correlations between tokens and labels, creating so-called shortcuts and hindering the generalizability of fine-tuned models. Existing debiasing methods often rely on prior knowledge of specific dataset biases, which is challenging to acquire a priori. We propose RAZOR (Rewriting And Zero-bias Optimization Refinement), a novel, unsupervised, and data-focused debiasing approach based on text rewriting for shortcut mitigation. RAZOR leverages LLMs to iteratively rewrite potentially biased text segments by replacing them with heuristically selected alternatives in a shortcut space defined by token statistics and positional information. This process aims to align surface-level text features more closely with diverse label distributions, thereby promoting the learning of genuine linguistic patterns. Compared with unsupervised SoTA models, RAZOR improves by 3.5% on the FEVER and 6.5% on MNLI and SNLI datasets according to the F1 score. Additionally, RAZOR effectively mitigates specific known biases, reducing bias-related terms by x2 without requiring prior bias information, a result that is on par with SoTA models that leverage prior information. Our work prioritizes data manipulation over architectural modifications, emphasizing the pivotal role of data quality in enhancing model performance and fairness. This research contributes to developing more robust evaluation benchmarks for debiasing methods by incorporating metrics for bias reduction and overall model efficacy.</description>

      <title>Progressive Multi-granular Alignments for Grounded Reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel at matching concepts across multi-modal inputs but struggle with compositional concepts and high-level relationships between entities. This paper introduces Progressive multi-granular Vision-Language alignments (PromViL), a novel framework to enhance LVLMs' ability in performing grounded compositional visual reasoning tasks. Our approach constructs a hierarchical structure of multi-modal alignments, ranging from simple to complex concepts. By progressively aligning textual descriptions with corresponding visual regions, our model learns to leverage contextual information from lower levels to inform higher-level reasoning. To facilitate this learning process, we introduce a data generation process that creates a novel dataset derived from Visual Genome, providing a wide range of nested compositional vision-language pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that our PromViL framework significantly outperforms baselines on various visual grounding and compositional question answering tasks. The code is available at: https://github.com/lqh52/PromViL.</description>

      <title>Score and Distribution Matching Policy: Advanced Accelerated Visuomotor Policies via Matched Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09265v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual-motor policy learning has advanced with architectures like diffusion-based policies, known for modeling complex robotic trajectories. However, their prolonged inference times hinder high-frequency control tasks requiring real-time feedback. While consistency distillation (CD) accelerates inference, it introduces errors that compromise action quality. To address these limitations, we propose the Score and Distribution Matching Policy (SDM Policy), which transforms diffusion-based policies into single-step generators through a two-stage optimization process: score matching ensures alignment with true action distributions, and distribution matching minimizes KL divergence for consistency. A dual-teacher mechanism integrates a frozen teacher for stability and an unfrozen teacher for adversarial training, enhancing robustness and alignment with target distributions. Evaluated on a 57-task simulation benchmark, SDM Policy achieves a 6x inference speedup while having state-of-the-art action quality, providing an efficient and reliable framework for high-frequency robotic tasks.</description>

      <title>SimAvatar: Simulation-Ready Avatars with Layered Hair and Clothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce SimAvatar, a framework designed to generate simulation-ready clothed 3D human avatars from a text prompt. Current text-driven human avatar generation methods either model hair, clothing, and the human body using a unified geometry or produce hair and garments that are not easily adaptable for simulation within existing simulation pipelines. The primary challenge lies in representing the hair and garment geometry in a way that allows leveraging established prior knowledge from foundational image diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) while being simulation-ready using either physics or neural simulators. To address this task, we propose a two-stage framework that combines the flexibility of 3D Gaussians with simulation-ready hair strands and garment meshes. Specifically, we first employ three text-conditioned 3D generative models to generate garment mesh, body shape and hair strands from the given text prompt. To leverage prior knowledge from foundational diffusion models, we attach 3D Gaussians to the body mesh, garment mesh, as well as hair strands and learn the avatar appearance through optimization. To drive the avatar given a pose sequence, we first apply physics simulators onto the garment meshes and hair strands. We then transfer the motion onto 3D Gaussians through carefully designed mechanisms for each body part. As a result, our synthesized avatars have vivid texture and realistic dynamic motion. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to produce highly realistic, fully simulation-ready 3D avatars, surpassing the capabilities of current approaches.</description>

      <title>Shape error prediction in 5-axis machining using graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative method for predicting shape errors in 5-axis machining using graph neural networks. The graph structure is defined with nodes representing workpiece surface points and edges denoting the neighboring relationships. The dataset encompasses data from a material removal simulation, process data, and post-machining quality information. Experimental results show that the presented approach can generalize the shape error prediction for the investigated workpiece geometry. Moreover, by modelling spatial and temporal connections within the workpiece, the approach handles a low number of labels compared to non-graphical methods such as Support Vector Machines.</description>

      <title>Generalization Analysis for Deep Contrastive Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present generalization bounds for the unsupervised risk in the Deep Contrastive Representation Learning framework, which employs deep neural networks as representation functions. We approach this problem from two angles. On the one hand, we derive a parameter-counting bound that scales with the overall size of the neural networks. On the other hand, we provide a norm-based bound that scales with the norms of neural networks' weight matrices. Ignoring logarithmic factors, the bounds are independent of $k$, the size of the tuples provided for contrastive learning. To the best of our knowledge, this property is only shared by one other work, which employed a different proof strategy and suffers from very strong exponential dependence on the depth of the network which is due to a use of the peeling technique. Our results circumvent this by leveraging powerful results on covering numbers with respect to uniform norms over samples. In addition, we utilize loss augmentation techniques to further reduce the dependency on matrix norms and the implicit dependence on network depth. In fact, our techniques allow us to produce many bounds for the contrastive learning setting with similar architectural dependencies as in the study of the sample complexity of ordinary loss functions, thereby bridging the gap between the learning theories of contrastive learning and DNNs.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Newton Dynamics for Neural Networks: A Riemannian Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the convergence of Gauss-Newton dynamics for training neural networks with smooth activation functions. In the underparameterized regime, the Gauss-Newton gradient flow induces a Riemannian gradient flow on a low-dimensional, smooth, embedded submanifold of the Euclidean output space. Using tools from Riemannian optimization, we prove \emph{last-iterate} convergence of the Riemannian gradient flow to the optimal in-class predictor at an \emph{exponential rate} that is independent of the conditioning of the Gram matrix, \emph{without} requiring explicit regularization. We further characterize the critical impacts of the neural network scaling factor and the initialization on the convergence behavior. In the overparameterized regime, we show that the Levenberg-Marquardt dynamics with an appropriately chosen damping factor yields robustness to ill-conditioned kernels, analogous to the underparameterized regime. These findings demonstrate the potential of Gauss-Newton methods for efficiently optimizing neural networks, particularly in ill-conditioned problems where kernel and Gram matrices have small singular values.</description>

      <title>E-CAR: Efficient Continuous Autoregressive Image Generation via Multistage Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models with continuous tokens for image generation show promising results by eliminating the need for discrete tokenization. However, these models face efficiency challenges due to their sequential token generation nature and reliance on computationally intensive diffusion-based sampling. We present ECAR (Efficient Continuous Auto-Regressive Image Generation via Multistage Modeling), an approach that addresses these limitations through two intertwined innovations: (1) a stage-wise continuous token generation strategy that reduces computational complexity and provides progressively refined token maps as hierarchical conditions, and (2) a multistage flow-based distribution modeling method that transforms only partial-denoised distributions at each stage comparing to complete denoising in normal diffusion models. Holistically, ECAR operates by generating tokens at increasing resolutions while simultaneously denoising the image at each stage. This design not only reduces token-to-image transformation cost by a factor of the stage number but also enables parallel processing at the token level. Our approach not only enhances computational efficiency but also aligns naturally with image generation principles by operating in continuous token space and following a hierarchical generation process from coarse to fine details. Experimental results demonstrate that ECAR achieves comparable image quality to DiT Peebles &amp; Xie [2023] while requiring 10$\times$ FLOPs reduction and 5$\times$ speedup to generate a 256$\times$256 image.</description>
