      <title>LLM-Driven Preference Data Synthesis for Proactive Prediction of the Next User Utterance in Human-Machine Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proactively predicting a users next utterance in human-machine dialogue can streamline interaction and improve user experience. Existing commercial API-based solutions are subject to privacy concerns while deploying general-purpose LLMs locally remains computationally expensive. As such, training a compact, task-specific LLM provides a practical alternative. Although user simulator methods can predict a user's next utterance, they mainly imitate their speaking style rather than advancing the dialogue. Preference data synthesis has been investigated to generate data for proactive next utterance prediction and help align LLMs with user preferences. Yet existing methods lack the ability to explicitly model the intent reasoning that leads to the user's next utterance and to define and synthesize preference and non-preference reasoning processes for predicting the user's next utterance.To address these challenges, we propose ProUtt, an LLM-driven preference data synthesis method for proactive next utterance prediction. ProUtt converts dialogue history into an intent tree and explicitly models intent reasoning trajectories by predicting the next plausible path from both exploitation and exploration perspectives. It then constructs preference and non-preference reasoning processes by perturbing or revising intent tree paths at different future turns. Extensive evaluations using LLM-as-a-judge and human judgments demonstrate that ProUtt consistently outperforms existing data synthesis methods, user simulators, and commercial LLM APIs across four benchmark datasets. We release both the code and the synthesized datasets to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Novelty in AI-Generated Research Plans Using Multi-Workflow LLM Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the scientific ecosystem raises fundamental questions about the creativity and originality of AI-generated research. Recent work has identified ``smart plagiarism'' as a concern in single-step prompting approaches, where models reproduce existing ideas with terminological shifts. This paper investigates whether agentic workflows -- multi-step systems employing iterative reasoning, evolutionary search, and recursive decomposition -- can generate more novel and feasible research plans. We benchmark five reasoning architectures: Reflection-based iterative refinement, Sakana AI v2 evolutionary algorithms, Google Co-Scientist multi-agent framework, GPT Deep Research (GPT-5.1) recursive decomposition, and Gemini~3 Pro multimodal long-context pipeline. Using evaluations from thirty proposals each on novelty, feasibility, and impact, we find that decomposition-based and long-context workflows achieve mean novelty of 4.17/5, while reflection-based approaches score significantly lower (2.33/5). Results reveal varied performance across research domains, with high-performing workflows maintaining feasibility without sacrificing creativity. These findings support the view that carefully designed multi-stage agentic workflows can advance AI-assisted research ideation.</description>

      <title>Introducing Axlerod: An LLM-based Chatbot for Assisting Independent Insurance Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The insurance industry is undergoing a paradigm shift through the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly in the realm of intelligent conversational agents. Chatbots have evolved into sophisticated AI-driven systems capable of automating complex workflows, including policy recommendation and claims triage, while simultaneously enabling dynamic, context-aware user engagement. This paper presents the design, implementation, and empirical evaluation of Axlerod, an AI-powered conversational interface designed to improve the operational efficiency of independent insurance agents. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and domain-specific knowledge integration, Axlerod demonstrates robust capabilities in parsing user intent, accessing structured policy databases, and delivering real-time, contextually relevant responses. Experimental results underscore Axlerod's effectiveness, achieving an overall accuracy of 93.18% in policy retrieval tasks while reducing the average search time by 2.42 seconds. This work contributes to the growing body of research on enterprise-grade AI applications in insurtech, with a particular focus on agent-assistive rather than consumer-facing architectures.</description>

      <title>Opportunities and Challenges of Natural Language Processing for Low-Resource Senegalese Languages in Social Science Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is rapidly transforming research methodologies across disciplines, yet African languages remain largely underrepresented in this technological shift. This paper provides the first comprehensive overview of NLP progress and challenges for the six national languages officially recognized by the Senegalese Constitution: Wolof, Pulaar, Sereer, Joola, Mandingue, and Soninke. We synthesize linguistic, sociotechnical, and infrastructural factors that shape their digital readiness and identify gaps in data, tools, and benchmarks. Building on existing initiatives and research works, we analyze ongoing efforts in text normalization, machine translation, and speech processing. We also provide a centralized GitHub repository that compiles publicly accessible resources for a range of NLP tasks across these languages, designed to facilitate collaboration and reproducibility. A special focus is devoted to the application of NLP to the social sciences, where multilingual transcription, translation, and retrieval pipelines can significantly enhance the efficiency and inclusiveness of field research. The paper concludes by outlining a roadmap toward sustainable, community-centered NLP ecosystems for Senegalese languages, emphasizing ethical data governance, open resources, and interdisciplinary collaboration.</description>

      <title>SALP-CG: Standard-Aligned LLM Pipeline for Classifying and Grading Large Volumes of Online Conversational Health Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online medical consultations generate large volumes of conversational health data that often embed protected health information, requiring robust methods to classify data categories and assign risk levels in line with policies and practice. However, existing approaches lack unified standards and reliable automated methods to fulfill sensitivity classification for such conversational health data. This study presents a large language model-based extraction pipeline, SALP-CG, for classifying and grading privacy risks in online conversational health data. We concluded health-data classification and grading rules in accordance with GB/T 39725-2020. Combining few-shot guidance, JSON Schema constrained decoding, and deterministic high-risk rules, the backend-agnostic extraction pipeline achieves strong category compliance and reliable sensitivity across diverse LLMs. On the MedDialog-CN benchmark, models yields robust entity counts, high schema compliance, and accurate sensitivity grading, while the strongest model attains micro-F1=0.900 for maximum-level prediction. The category landscape stratified by sensitivity shows that Level 2-3 items dominate, enabling re-identification when combined; Level 4-5 items are less frequent but carry outsize harm. SALP-CG reliably helps classify categories and grading sensitivity in online conversational health data across LLMs, offering a practical method for health data governance.

      <title>StatLLaMA: A multi-stage training framework for building a domain-optimized statistical language model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how to efficiently build a domain-specialized large language model (LLM) for statistics using the lightweight LLaMA-3.2-3B family as the foundation model (FM). We systematically compare three multi-stage training pipelines, starting from a base FM with no instruction-following capability, a base FM augmented with post-hoc instruction tuning, and an instruction-tuned FM with strong general reasoning abilities across continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) preference alignment, and downstream task adaptation. Results show that pipelines beginning with a base FM fail to develop meaningful statistical reasoning, even after extensive instruction tuning, SFT, or RLHF alignment. In contrast, starting from LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct enables effective domain specialization. A comprehensive evaluation of SFT variants reveals clear trade-offs between domain expertise and general reasoning ability. We further demonstrate that direct preference optimization provides stable and effective RLHF preference alignment. Finally, we show that downstream fine-tuning must be performed with extremely low intensity to avoid catastrophic forgetting in highly optimized models. The final model, StatLLaMA, achieves strong and balanced performance on benchmarks of mathematical reasoning, common-sense reasoning, and statistical expertise, offering a practical blueprint for developing resource-efficient statistical LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/HuangDLab/StatLLaMA.</description>

      <title>Bounded Hyperbolic Tangent: A Stable and Efficient Alternative to Pre-Layer Normalization in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN) is the de facto choice for large language models (LLMs) and is crucial for stable pretraining and effective transfer learning. However, Pre-LN is inefficient due to repeated statistical calculations and suffers from the curse of depth. As layers grow, the magnitude and variance of the hidden state escalate, destabilizing training. Efficiency-oriented normalization-free methods such as Dynamic Tanh (DyT) improve speed but remain fragile at depth. To jointly address stability and efficiency, we propose Bounded Hyperbolic Tanh (BHyT), a drop-in replacement for Pre-LN. BHyT couples a tanh nonlinearity with explicit, data-driven input bounding to keep activations within a non-saturating range. It prevents depth-wise growth in activation magnitude and variance and comes with a theoretical stability guarantee. For efficiency, BHyT computes exact statistics once per block and replaces a second normalization with a lightweight variance approximation, enhancing efficiency. Empirically, BHyT demonstrates improved stability and efficiency during pretraining, achieving an average of 15.8% faster training and an average of 4.2% higher token generation throughput compared to RMSNorm., while matching or surpassing its inference performance and robustness across language understanding and reasoning benchmarks.

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Knowledge Graphs for Reliable Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Question answering (QA) systems are increasingly deployed across domains. However, their reliability is undermined when retrieved evidence is incomplete, noisy, or uncertain. Existing knowledge graph (KG) based QA frameworks typically represent facts as static and deterministic, failing to capture the evolving nature of information and the uncertainty inherent in reasoning. We present a demonstration of uncertainty-aware dynamic KGs, a framework that combines (i) dynamic construction of evolving KGs, (ii) confidence scoring and uncertainty-aware retrieval, and (iii) an interactive interface for reliable and interpretable QA. Our system highlights how uncertainty modeling can make QA more robust and transparent by enabling users to explore dynamic graphs, inspect confidence-annotated triples, and compare baseline versus confidence-aware answers. The target users of this demo are clinical data scientists and clinicians, and we instantiate the framework in healthcare: constructing personalized KGs from electronic health records, visualizing uncertainty across patient visits, and evaluating its impact on a mortality prediction task. This use case demonstrates the broader promise of uncertainty-aware dynamic KGs for enhancing QA reliability in high-stakes applications.</description>

      <title>Cross-Platform Evaluation of Large Language Model Safety in Pediatric Consultations: Evolution of Adversarial Robustness and the Scale Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in medical consultations, yet their safety under realistic user pressures remains understudied. Prior assessments focused on neutral conditions, overlooking vulnerabilities from anxious users challenging safeguards. This study evaluated LLM safety under parental anxiety-driven adversarial pressures in pediatric consultations across models and platforms. Methods PediatricAnxietyBench, from a prior evaluation, includes 300 queries (150 authentic, 150 adversarial) spanning 10 topics. Three models were assessed via APIs: Llama-3.3-70B and Llama-3.1-8B (Groq), Mistral-7B (HuggingFace), yielding 900 responses. Safety used a 0-15 scale for restraint, referral, hedging, emergency recognition, and non-prescriptive behavior. Analyses employed paired t-tests with bootstrapped CIs. Results Mean scores: 9.70 (Llama-3.3-70B) to 10.39 (Mistral-7B). Llama-3.1-8B outperformed Llama-3.3-70B by +0.66 (p=0.0001, d=0.225). Models showed positive adversarial effects, Mistral-7B strongest (+1.09, p=0.0002). Safety generalized across platforms; Llama-3.3-70B had 8% failures. Seizures vulnerable (33% inappropriate diagnoses). Hedging predicted safety (r=0.68, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions Evaluation shows safety depends on alignment and architecture over scale, with smaller models outperforming larger. Evolution to robustness across releases suggests targeted training progress. Vulnerabilities and no emergency recognition indicate unsuitability for triage. Findings guide selection, stress adversarial testing, and provide open benchmark for medical AI safety.</description>

      <title>ADMEDTAGGER: an annotation framework for distillation of expert knowledge for the Polish medical language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an annotation framework that demonstrates how a multilingual LLM pretrained on a large corpus can be used as a teacher model to distill the expert knowledge needed for tagging medical texts in Polish. This work is part of a larger project called ADMEDVOICE, within which we collected an extensive corpus of medical texts representing five clinical categories - Radiology, Oncology, Cardiology, Hypertension, and Pathology. Using this data, we had to develop a multi-class classifier, but the fundamental problem turned out to be the lack of resources for annotating an adequate number of texts. Therefore, in our solution, we used the multilingual Llama3.1 model to annotate an extensive corpus of medical texts in Polish. Using our limited annotation resources, we verified only a portion of these labels, creating a test set from them. The data annotated in this way were then used for training and validation of 3 different types of classifiers based on the BERT architecture - the distilled DistilBERT model, BioBERT fine-tuned on medical data, and HerBERT fine-tuned on the Polish language corpus. Among the models we trained, the DistilBERT model achieved the best results, reaching an F1 score &gt; 0.80 for each clinical category and an F1 score &gt; 0.93 for 3 of them. In this way, we obtained a series of highly effective classifiers that represent an alternative to large language models, due to their nearly 500 times smaller size, 300 times lower GPU VRAM consumption, and several hundred times faster inference.</description>

      <title>SagaScale: A Realistic, Scalable, and High-Quality Long-Context Benchmark Built from Full-Length Novels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress, but understanding long and complex documents remains challenging. Many long-context benchmarks have been proposed, but they face several limitations, including task realism, data scalability, and data quality. To this end, we introduce SagaScale, a realistic, scalable, and high-quality long-context benchmark built from full-length novels. The entire benchmark is constructed using an automated data collection pipeline that utilizes external resources (e.g., Wikipedia pages) to curate question-answer pairs. Critically, these external resources are provided only for benchmark construction and not during evaluation, which allows LLMs to curate complex questions that go beyond what they can answer during evaluation. SagaScale is also bilingual and offers the largest context length to date, with average token counts exceeding 250K for English novels and 320K for Chinese novels. Our evaluation across 12 frontier LLMs and three long-context methods -- Na\"ive RAG, Agentic RAG, and Long Context -- yields key insights, including: (1) Directly supplying the full context to the LLM can outperform other methods by a large margin; (2) Most LLMs still struggle with lengthy contexts, but Gemini-2.5-Pro stands out as an exception; and (3) Agentic RAG effectively addresses the retrieval bottleneck in Na\"ive RAG. Finally, we publicly release the SagaScale benchmark and our data collection codebase to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Syntactic Framing Fragility: An Audit of Robustness in LLM Ethical Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in consequential decision-making settings, yet their robustness to benign prompt variation remains underexplored. In this work, we study whether LLMs maintain consistent ethical judgments across logically equivalent but syntactically different prompts, focusing on variations involving negation and conditional structure. We introduce Syntactic Framing Fragility (SFF), a robustness evaluation framework that isolates purely syntactic effects via Logical Polarity Normalization (LPN), enabling direct comparison of decisions across positive and negative framings without semantic drift. Auditing 23 state-of-the-art models spanning the U.S. and China as well as small U.S. open-source software models over 14 ethical scenarios and four controlled framings (39,975 decisions), we find widespread and statistically significant inconsistency: many models reverse ethical endorsements solely due to syntactic polarity, with open-source models exhibiting over twice the fragility of commercial counterparts. We further uncover extreme negation sensitivity, where some models endorse actions in 80-97% of cases when explicitly prompted with "should not." We show that eliciting chain-of-thought reasoning substantially reduces fragility, identifying a practical mitigation lever, and we map fragility across scenarios, finding higher risk in financial and business contexts than in medical scenarios. Our results demonstrate that syntactic consistency constitutes a distinct and critical dimension of ethical robustness, and we argue that SFF-style audits should be a standard component of safety evaluation for deployed LLMs. Code and results will be available on github.com.</description>

      <title>Assessing and Improving Punctuation Robustness in English-Marathi Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Punctuation plays a critical role in resolving semantic and structural ambiguity in written language. Machine Translation (MT) systems are now widely applied across diverse domains and languages, including many low-resource settings. In this work, we focus on Marathi, a low- to middle-resource language. We introduce Vir\=am, the first diagnostic benchmark for assessing punctuation robustness in English-to-Marathi machine translation, consisting of 54 manually curated, punctuation-ambiguous instances. We evaluate two primary strategies for enhancing reliability: a pipeline-based restore-then-translate approach and direct fine-tuned on punctuation-varied data. Our results demonstrate that specialized fine-tuned models and pipeline systems significantly improve translation quality over standard baselines on the Vir\=am benchmark. Qualitative analysis reveals that the original model may result in wrong translations leading to wrong interpretations, while fine-tuned models significantly improve overall reliability. Furthermore, we find that current Large Language Models (LLMs) lag behind these task-specific approaches in preserving meaning for punctuation-ambiguous text, thus necessitating further research in this area.</description>

      <title>Forgetting as a Feature: Cognitive Alignment of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often evaluated against ideals of perfect Bayesian inference, yet growing evidence suggests that their in-context reasoning exhibits systematic forgetting of past information. Rather than viewing this behavior as a limitation, we reinterpret forgetting as a functional cognitive mechanism. Drawing inspiration from human memory dynamics, we model LLM inference as a probabilistic memory process governed by exponential decay. We introduce a benchmark suite that evaluates temporal reasoning, concept drift adaptation, and associative recall, enabling direct comparison between model behavior and human cognitive patterns. Our empirical results reveal that LLMs demonstrate forgetting rates analogous to human memory efficiency trade-offs between stability and adaptability. Building on these observations, we propose probabilistic memory prompting, a lightweight strategy that shapes evidence integration to mimic human-like memory decay, leading to improved long-horizon reasoning performance. Our findings position forgetting not as a failure mode, but as a principled mechanism for adaptive intelligence.</description>

      <title>SciNets: Graph-Constrained Multi-Hop Reasoning for Scientific Literature Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain scientific synthesis requires connecting mechanistic explanations across fragmented literature, a capability that remains challenging for both retrieval-based systems and unconstrained language models. While recent work has applied large language models to scientific summarization and question answering, these approaches provide limited control over reasoning depth and structural grounding. We frame mechanistic synthesis as a graph-constrained multi-hop reasoning problem over literature-derived concept graphs. Given a scientific query and a compact, query-local corpus, SciNets constructs a directed concept graph and synthesizes mechanistic explanations by identifying multi-hop reasoning paths that connect concepts that rarely co-occur within individual papers. We systematically compare shortest-path reasoning, k-shortest paths with diversity constraints, stochastic random walks, and a retrieval-augmented language model baseline. Rather than evaluating correctness, which is often indeterminate when synthesizing connections across distributed sources, we introduce a behavioral framework that measures symbolic reasoning depth, mechanistic diversity, and grounding stability. Across machine learning, biology, and climate science tasks, explicit graph constraints enable controllable multi-hop reasoning while revealing a consistent trade-off: deeper and more diverse symbolic reasoning increases grounding instability, whereas shortest-path reasoning remains highly stable but structurally conservative. These findings provide a systematic behavioral characterization of the limits and capabilities of current graph-LLM integration for scientific synthesis.</description>

      <title>Eliminating Agentic Workflow for Introduction Generation with Parametric Stage Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, using predefined agentic workflows to guide large language models (LLMs) for literature classification and review has become a research focus. However, writing research introductions is more challenging. It requires rigorous logic, coherent structure, and abstract summarization. Existing workflows often suffer from long reasoning chains, error accumulation, and reduced textual coherence. To address these limitations, we propose eliminating external agentic workflows. Instead, we directly parameterize their logical structure into the LLM. This allows the generation of a complete introduction in a single inference. To this end, we introduce the Stage Token for Introduction Generation (STIG). STIG converts the multiple stages of the original workflow into explicit stage signals. These signals guide the model to follow different logical roles and functions during generation. Through instruction tuning, the model learns the mapping between stage tokens and text functions. It also learns the logical order and transition patterns between stages, encoding this knowledge into the model parameters. Experimental results show that STIG can generate multi-stage text in a single inference. It does not require explicit workflow calls. STIG outperforms traditional agentic workflows and other baselines on metrics of semantic similarity and sentence-level structural rationality. The code is provided in the Supplementary Materials.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Business Analytics through Hybrid Summarization of Financial Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial reports and earnings communications contain large volumes of structured and semi structured information, making detailed manual analysis inefficient. Earnings conference calls provide valuable evidence about a firm's performance, outlook, and strategic priorities. The manual analysis of lengthy call transcripts requires substantial effort and is susceptible to interpretive bias and unintentional error. In this work, we present a hybrid summarization framework that combines extractive and abstractive techniques to produce concise and factually reliable Reuters-style summaries from the ECTSum dataset. The proposed two stage pipeline first applies the LexRank algorithm to identify salient sentences, which are subsequently summarized using fine-tuned variants of BART and PEGASUS designed for resource constrained settings. In parallel, we fine-tune a Longformer Encoder-Decoder (LED) model to directly capture long-range contextual dependencies in financial documents.
  Model performance is evaluated using standard automatic metrics, including ROUGE, METEOR, MoverScore, and BERTScore, along with domain-specific variants such as SciBERTScore and FinBERTScore. To assess factual accuracy, we further employ entity-level measures based on source-precision and F1-target. The results highlight complementary trade offs between approaches, long context models yield the strongest overall performance, while the hybrid framework achieves competitive results with improved factual consistency under computational constraints. These findings support the development of practical summarization systems for efficiently distilling lengthy financial texts into usable business insights.</description>

      <title>Clinical Document Metadata Extraction: A Scoping Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical document metadata, such as document type, structure, author role, medical specialty, and encounter setting, is essential for accurate interpretation of information captured in clinical documents. However, vast documentation heterogeneity and drift over time challenge harmonization of document metadata. Automated extraction methods have emerged to coalesce metadata from disparate practices into target schema. This scoping review aims to catalog research on clinical document metadata extraction, identify methodological trends and applications, and highlight gaps. We followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines to identify articles that perform clinical document metadata extraction. We initially found and screened 266 articles published between January 2011 and August 2025, then comprehensively reviewed 67 we deemed relevant to our study. Among the articles included, 45 were methodological, 17 used document metadata as features in a downstream application, and 5 analyzed document metadata composition. We observe myriad purposes for methodological study and application types. Available labelled public data remains sparse except for structural section datasets. Methods for extracting document metadata have progressed from largely rule-based and traditional machine learning with ample feature engineering to transformer-based architectures with minimal feature engineering. The emergence of large language models has enabled broader exploration of generalizability across tasks and datasets, allowing the possibility of advanced clinical text processing systems. We anticipate that research will continue to expand into richer document metadata representations and integrate further into clinical applications and workflows.</description>

      <title>Geometric Patterns of Meaning: A PHATE Manifold Analysis of Multi-lingual Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a multi-level analysis framework for examining semantic geometry in multilingual embeddings, implemented through Semanscope (a visualization tool that applies PHATE manifold learning across four linguistic levels). Analysis of diverse datasets spanning sub-character components, alphabetic systems, semantic domains, and numerical concepts reveals systematic geometric patterns and critical limitations in current embedding models. At the sub-character level, purely structural elements (Chinese radicals) exhibit geometric collapse, highlighting model failures to distinguish semantic from structural components. At the character level, different writing systems show distinct geometric signatures. At the word level, content words form clustering-branching patterns across 20 semantic domains in English, Chinese, and German. Arabic numbers organize through spiral trajectories rather than clustering, violating standard distributional semantics assumptions. These findings establish PHATE manifold learning as an essential analytic tool not only for studying geometric structure of meaning in embedding space, but also for validating the effectiveness of embedding models in capturing semantic relationships.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Cross-Lingual Semantic Alignment in Multilingual Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With hundreds of multilingual embedding models available, practitioners lack clear guidance on which provide genuine cross-lingual semantic alignment versus task performance through language-specific patterns. Task-driven benchmarks (MTEB) may mask fundamental alignment shortcomings. We introduce Semantic Affinity (SA), a bounded (between 0 and 1) metric measuring inter-lingual to intra-lingual spread ratio using cosine distance, combined with PHATE visualization in our Semanscope framework. Benchmarking 13 models across 4 datasets (52 experiments) reveals a three-tier structure: (1) Top BERT models (LaBSE SA = 0.70, USE SA = 0.68, S-BERT SA = 0.68) achieve strong alignment via translation-pair supervision; (2) LLM embeddings plateau at SA between 0.55 and 0.61 regardless of 0.6 B to 8 B scale; (3) MLM-only BERT models (mBERT, XLM-R, SA &lt; 0.50) fail despite more than 100 language training. Training objective, not architecture or scale, determines alignment. Oracle Bone primitives (1200 BCE) expose semantic drift-models learn corpus patterns rather than cognitive primitives. This work provides semantic benchmarking to help practitioners select quality multilingual embeddings from hundreds of available models, showing cross-lingual alignment requires explicit translation supervision, not merely model scale or multilingual data.</description>

      <title>Closing the Data Loop: Using OpenDataArena to Engineer Superior Training Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) datasets is a critical yet under-theorized stage in the post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs), as prevalent practices often rely on heuristic aggregation without a systematic understanding of how individual samples contribute to model performance. In this report, we propose a paradigm shift from ad-hoc curation to a closed-loop dataset engineering framework using OpenDataArena (ODA), which leverages value-anchored rankings and multi-dimensional analysis to transform value benchmarking into feedback signals guiding dataset construction. We instantiate this methodology through two new datasets: \textbf{ODA-Math-460k}, a specialized mathematics reasoning dataset that utilizes a novel two-stage difficulty-aware pipeline to achieve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) results on benchmarks such as AIME and HMMT, and \textbf{ODA-Mixture (100k \&amp; 500k)}, a series of multi-domain instruction datasets built via an ``Anchor-and-Patch'' strategy that outperforms significantly larger open-source baselines. Our empirical results demonstrate that ODA-driven datasets significantly improve both domain-specific reasoning and general utility while achieving superior data efficiency, validating a transition toward data-centric AI where transparent evaluation serves as the primary engine for engineering high-quality training data.</description>

      <title>From Detection to Diagnosis: Advancing Hallucination Analysis with Automated Data Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), defined as the generation of content inconsistent with facts or context, represent a core obstacle to their reliable deployment in critical domains. Current research primarily focuses on binary "detection" approaches that, while capable of identifying hallucinations, fail to provide interpretable and actionable feedback for model improvement, thus limiting practical utility. To address this limitation, a new research paradigm is proposed, shifting from "detection" to "diagnosis". The Hallucination Diagnosis Task is introduced, a task which requires models to not only detect hallucinations, but also perform error localization, causal explanation, and content correction. We develop the Hallucination Diagnosis Generator (HDG), an automated pipeline that systematically generates high-quality training samples with rich diagnostic metadata from raw corpora through multi-dimensional augmentation strategies including controlled fact fabrication and reasoning chain perturbation. Using HDG-generated data, we train HDM-4B-RL, a 4-billion-parameter hallucination diagnosis model, employing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a comprehensive reward function incorporating structural, accuracy, and localization signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses previous state-of-the-art detection models on the HaluEval benchmark while achieving comparable performance to advanced general-purpose models. In comprehensive diagnosis tasks, HDM-4B-RL matches the capabilities of larger general models while maintaining a smaller size. This work validates the feasibility and value of hallucination diagnosis, providing an effective methodology for building more trustworthy and reliable generative AI systems.</description>

      <title>Stable and Explainable Personality Trait Evaluation in Large Language Models with Internal Activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating personality traits in Large Language Models (LLMs) is key to model interpretation, comparison, and responsible deployment. However, existing questionnaire-based evaluation methods exhibit limited stability and offer little explainability, as their results are highly sensitive to minor variations in prompt phrasing or role-play configurations. To address these limitations, we propose an internal-activation-based approach, termed Persona-Vector Neutrality Interpolation (PVNI), for stable and explainable personality trait evaluation in LLMs. PVNI extracts a persona vector associated with a target personality trait from the model's internal activations using contrastive prompts. It then estimates the corresponding neutral score by interpolating along the persona vector as an anchor axis, enabling an interpretable comparison between the neutral prompt representation and the persona direction. We provide a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness and generalization properties of PVNI. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs demonstrate that PVNI yields substantially more stable personality trait evaluations than existing methods, even under questionnaire and role-play variants.</description>

      <title>Bears, all bears, and some bears. Language Constraints on Language Models' Inductive Inferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language places subtle constraints on how we make inductive inferences. Developmental evidence by Gelman et al. (2002) has shown children (4 years and older) to differentiate among generic statements ("Bears are daxable"), universally quantified NPs ("all bears are daxable") and indefinite plural NPs ("some bears are daxable") in extending novel properties to a specific member (all &gt; generics &gt; some), suggesting that they represent these types of propositions differently. We test if these subtle differences arise in general purpose statistical learners like Vision Language Models, by replicating the original experiment. On tasking them through a series of precondition tests (robust identification of categories in images and sensitivities to all and some), followed by the original experiment, we find behavioral alignment between models and humans. Post-hoc analyses on their representations revealed that these differences are organized based on inductive constraints and not surface-form differences.</description>

      <title>MedRedFlag: Investigating how LLMs Redirect Misconceptions in Real-World Health Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world health questions from patients often unintentionally embed false assumptions or premises. In such cases, safe medical communication typically involves redirection: addressing the implicit misconception and then responding to the underlying patient context, rather than the original question. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used by lay users for medical advice, they have not yet been tested for this crucial competency. Therefore, in this work, we investigate how LLMs react to false premises embedded within real-world health questions. We develop a semi-automated pipeline to curate MedRedFlag, a dataset of 1100+ questions sourced from Reddit that require redirection. We then systematically compare responses from state-of-the-art LLMs to those from clinicians. Our analysis reveals that LLMs often fail to redirect problematic questions, even when the problematic premise is detected, and provide answers that could lead to suboptimal medical decision making. Our benchmark and results reveal a novel and substantial gap in how LLMs perform under the conditions of real-world health communication, highlighting critical safety concerns for patient-facing medical AI systems. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/srsambara-1/MedRedFlag.</description>

      <title>OUTLINEFORGE: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Explicit States for Scientific Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific paper generation requires document-level planning and factual grounding, but current large language models, despite their strong local fluency, often fail in global structure, input coverage, and citation consistency. We present a reinforcement learning framework that casts scientific outline construction as a long-horizon planning problem over hierarchical document structures. Our approach models edit evolving outlines through structured actions, enabling the system to incrementally build a complete scientific manuscript. To support effective and stabilize learning,we introduce a two-stage optimization procedure consisting of (i) backward outline reconstruction from partial plans to enforce global structural consistency, and (ii) forward value-guided reinforcement learning with rewards explicitly modeling scientific correctness, discourse coherence, and citation fidelity. In addition, We further introduce a benchmark for scientific paper generation that evaluates document planning, input utilization, reference faithfulness, outline organization, and content-level factual accuracy. Our results show consistent improvements over strong neural and LLM baselines, particularly in long-range structural coherence and citation reliability.</description>

      <title>Patient-Similarity Cohort Reasoning in Clinical Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world clinical text-to-SQL requires reasoning over heterogeneous EHR tables, temporal windows, and patient-similarity cohorts to produce executable queries. We introduce CLINSQL, a benchmark of 633 expert-annotated tasks on MIMIC-IV v3.1 that demands multi-table joins, clinically meaningful filters, and executable SQL. Solving CLINSQL entails navigating schema metadata and clinical coding systems, handling long contexts, and composing multi-step queries beyond traditional text-to-SQL. We evaluate 22 proprietary and open-source models under Chain-of-Thought self-refinement and use rubric-based SQL analysis with execution checks that prioritize critical clinical requirements. Despite recent advances, performance remains far from clinical reliability: on the test set, GPT-5-mini attains 74.7% execution score, DeepSeek-R1 leads open-source at 69.2% and Gemini-2.5-Pro drops from 85.5% on Easy to 67.2% on Hard. Progress on CLINSQL marks tangible advances toward clinically reliable text-to-SQL for real-world EHR analytics.</description>

Abstract: How predictable a word is can be quantified in two ways: using human responses to the cloze task or using probabilities from language models (LMs).When used as predictors of processing effort, LM probabilities outperform probabilities derived from cloze data. However, it is important to establish that LM probabilities do so for the right reasons, since different predictors can lead to different scientific conclusions about the role of prediction in language comprehension. We present evidence for three hypotheses about the advantage of LM probabilities: not suffering from low resolution, distinguishing semantically similar words, and accurately assigning probabilities to low-frequency words. These results call for efforts to improve the resolution of cloze studies, coupled with experiments on whether human-like prediction is also as sensitive to the fine-grained distinctions made by LM probabilities.</description>

      <title>Take Out Your Calculators: Estimating the Real Difficulty of Question Items with LLM Student Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standardized math assessments require expensive human pilot studies to establish the difficulty of test items. We investigate the predictive value of open-source large language models (LLMs) for evaluating the difficulty of multiple-choice math questions for real-world students. We show that, while LLMs are poor direct judges of problem difficulty, simulation-based approaches with LLMs yield promising results under the right conditions. Under the proposed approach, we simulate a "classroom" of 4th, 8th, or 12th grade students by prompting the LLM to role-play students of varying proficiency levels. We use the outcomes of these simulations to fit Item Response Theory (IRT) models, comparing learned difficulty parameters for items to their real-world difficulties, as determined by item-level statistics furnished by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). We observe correlations as high as 0.75, 0.76, and 0.82 for grades 4, 8, and 12, respectively. In our simulations, we experiment with different "classroom sizes," showing tradeoffs between computation size and accuracy. We find that role-plays with named students improves predictions (compared to student ids), and stratifying names across gender and race further improves predictions. Our results show that LLMs with relatively weaker mathematical abilities (Gemma) actually yield better real-world difficulty predictions than mathematically stronger models (Llama and Qwen), further underscoring the suitability of open-source models for the task.</description>

      <title>Context Volume Drives Performance: Tackling Domain Shift in Extremely Low-Resource Translation via RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models for low-resource languages suffer significant performance degradation under domain shift. We quantify this challenge using Dhao, an indigenous language of Eastern Indonesia with no digital footprint beyond the New Testament (NT). When applied to the unseen Old Testament (OT), a standard NMT model fine-tuned on the NT drops from an in-domain score of 36.17 chrF++ to 27.11 chrF++. To recover this loss, we introduce a hybrid framework where a fine-tuned NMT model generates an initial draft, which is then refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The final system achieves 35.21 chrF++ (+8.10 recovery), effectively matching the original in-domain quality. Our analysis reveals that this performance is driven primarily by the number of retrieved examples rather than the choice of retrieval algorithm. Qualitative analysis confirms the LLM acts as a robust "safety net," repairing severe failures in zero-shot domains.</description>

      <title>SocraticKG: Knowledge Graph Construction via QA-Driven Fact Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing Knowledge Graphs (KGs) from unstructured text provides a structured framework for knowledge representation and reasoning, yet current LLM-based approaches struggle with a fundamental trade-off: factual coverage often leads to relational fragmentation, while premature consolidation causes information loss. To address this, we propose SocraticKG, an automated KG construction method that introduces question-answer pairs as a structured intermediate representation to systematically unfold document-level semantics prior to triple extraction. By employing 5W1H-guided QA expansion, SocraticKG captures contextual dependencies and implicit relational links typically lost in direct KG extraction pipelines, providing explicit grounding in the source document that helps mitigate implicit reasoning errors. Evaluation on the MINE benchmark demonstrates that our approach effectively addresses the coverage-connectivity trade-off, achieving superior factual retention while maintaining high structural cohesion even as extracted knowledge volume substantially expands. These results highlight that QA-mediated semantic scaffolding plays a critical role in structuring semantics prior to KG extraction, enabling more coherent and reliable graph construction in subsequent stages.</description>

      <title>EHRNavigator: A Multi-Agent System for Patient-Level Clinical Question Answering over Heterogeneous Electronic Health Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical decision-making increasingly relies on timely and context-aware access to patient information within Electronic Health Records (EHRs), yet most existing natural language question-answering (QA) systems are evaluated solely on benchmark datasets, limiting their practical relevance. To overcome this limitation, we introduce EHRNavigator, a multi-agent framework that harnesses AI agents to perform patient-level question answering across heterogeneous and multimodal EHR data. We assessed its performance using both public benchmark and institutional datasets under realistic hospital conditions characterized by diverse schemas, temporal reasoning demands, and multimodal evidence integration. Through quantitative evaluation and clinician-validated chart review, EHRNavigator demonstrated strong generalization, achieving 86% accuracy on real-world cases while maintaining clinically acceptable response times. Overall, these findings confirm that EHRNavigator effectively bridges the gap between benchmark evaluation and clinical deployment, offering a robust, adaptive, and efficient solution for real-world EHR question answering.</description>

      <title>EmplifAI: a Fine-grained Dataset for Japanese Empathetic Medical Dialogues in 28 Emotion Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces EmplifAI, a Japanese empathetic dialogue dataset designed to support patients coping with chronic medical conditions. They often experience a wide range of positive and negative emotions (e.g., hope and despair) that shift across different stages of disease management. EmplifAI addresses this complexity by providing situation-based dialogues grounded in 28 fine-grained emotion categories, adapted and validated from the GoEmotions taxonomy. The dataset includes 280 medically contextualized situations and 4125 two-turn dialogues, collected through crowdsourcing and expert review. To evaluate emotional alignment in empathetic dialogues, we assessed model predictions on situation--dialogue pairs using BERTScore across multiple large language models (LLMs), achieving F1 scores of 0.83. Fine-tuning a baseline Japanese LLM (LLM-jp-3.1-13b-instruct4) with EmplifAI resulted in notable improvements in fluency, general empathy, and emotion-specific empathy. Furthermore, we compared the scores assigned by LLM-as-a-Judge and human raters on dialogues generated by multiple LLMs to validate our evaluation pipeline and discuss the insights and potential risks derived from the correlation analysis.</description>

      <title>Long-Chain Reasoning Distillation via Adaptive Prefix Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, particularly in solving complex mathematical problems. Recent studies show that distilling long reasoning trajectories can effectively enhance the reasoning performance of small-scale student models. However, teacher-generated reasoning trajectories are often excessively long and structurally complex, making them difficult for student models to learn. This mismatch leads to a gap between the provided supervision signal and the learning capacity of the student model. To address this challenge, we propose Prefix-ALIGNment distillation (P-ALIGN), a framework that fully exploits teacher CoTs for distillation through adaptive prefix alignment. Specifically, P-ALIGN adaptively truncates teacher-generated reasoning trajectories by determining whether the remaining suffix is concise and sufficient to guide the student model. Then, P-ALIGN leverages the teacher-generated prefix to supervise the student model, encouraging effective prefix alignment. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that P-ALIGN outperforms all baselines by over 3%. Further analysis indicates that the prefixes constructed by P-ALIGN provide more effective supervision signals, while avoiding the negative impact of redundant and uncertain reasoning components. All code is available at https://github.com/NEUIR/P-ALIGN.</description>

      <title>Deriving Character Logic from Storyline as Codified Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Role-playing (RP) agents rely on behavioral profiles to act consistently across diverse narrative contexts, yet existing profiles are largely unstructured, non-executable, and weakly validated, leading to brittle agent behavior. We propose Codified Decision Trees (CDT), a data-driven framework that induces an executable and interpretable decision structure from large-scale narrative data. CDT represents behavioral profiles as a tree of conditional rules, where internal nodes correspond to validated scene conditions and leaves encode grounded behavioral statements, enabling deterministic retrieval of context-appropriate rules at execution time. The tree is learned by iteratively inducing candidate scene-action rules, validating them against data, and refining them through hierarchical specialization, yielding profiles that support transparent inspection and principled updates. Across multiple benchmarks, CDT substantially outperforms human-written profiles and prior profile induction methods on $85$ characters across $16$ artifacts, indicating that codified and validated behavioral representations lead to more reliable agent grounding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication in times of crisis is essential. However, there is often a mismatch between the language of governments, aid providers, doctors, and those to whom they are providing aid. Commercial MT systems are reasonable tools to turn to in these scenarios. But how effective are these tools for translating to and from low resource languages, particularly in the crisis or medical domain? In this study, we evaluate four commercial MT systems using the TICO-19 dataset, which is composed of pandemic-related sentences from a large set of high priority languages spoken by communities most likely to be affected adversely in the next pandemic. We then assess the current degree of ``readiness'' for another pandemic (or epidemic) based on the usability of the output translations.</description>

      <title>CALM-IT: Generating Realistic Long-Form Motivational Interviewing Dialogues with Dual-Actor Conversational Dynamics Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in mental health-related settings, yet they struggle to sustain realistic, goal-directed dialogue over extended interactions. While LLMs generate fluent responses, they optimize locally for the next turn rather than maintaining a coherent model of therapeutic progress, leading to brittleness and long-horizon drift. We introduce CALM-IT, a framework for generating and evaluating long-form Motivational Interviewing (MI) dialogues that explicitly models dual-actor conversational dynamics. CALM-IT represents therapist-client interaction as a bidirectional state-space process, in which both agents continuously update inferred alignment, mental states, and short-term goals to guide strategy selection and utterance generation. Across large-scale evaluations, CALM-IT consistently outperforms strong baselines in Effectiveness and Goal Alignment and remains substantially more stable as conversation length increases. Although CALM-IT initiates fewer therapist redirections, it achieves the highest client acceptance rate (64.3%), indicating more precise and therapeutically aligned intervention timing. Overall, CALM-IT provides evidence for modeling evolving conversational state being essential for generating high-quality long-form synthetic conversations.</description>

      <title>SIN-Bench: Tracing Native Evidence Chains in Long-Context Multimodal Scientific Interleaved Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating whether multimodal large language models truly understand long-form scientific papers remains challenging: answer-only metrics and synthetic "Needle-In-A-Haystack" tests often reward answer matching without requiring a causal, evidence-linked reasoning trace in the document. We propose the "Fish-in-the-Ocean" (FITO) paradigm, which requires models to construct explicit cross-modal evidence chains within native scientific documents. To operationalize FITO, we build SIN-Data, a scientific interleaved corpus that preserves the native interleaving of text and figures. On top of it, we construct SIN-Bench with four progressive tasks covering evidence discovery (SIN-Find), hypothesis verification (SIN-Verify), grounded QA (SIN-QA), and evidence-anchored synthesis (SIN-Summary). We further introduce "No Evidence, No Score", scoring predictions when grounded to verifiable anchors and diagnosing evidence quality via matching, relevance, and logic. Experiments on eight MLLMs show that grounding is the primary bottleneck: Gemini-3-pro achieves the best average overall score (0.573), while GPT-5 attains the highest SIN-QA answer accuracy (0.767) but underperforms on evidence-aligned overall scores, exposing a gap between correctness and traceable support.</description>

      <title>Skill-Aware Data Selection and Fine-Tuning for Data-Efficient Reasoning Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 and their distilled variants achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, distilling these models often demands large-scale data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), motivating the pursuit of data-efficient training methods. To address this, we propose a skill-centric distillation framework that efficiently transfers reasoning ability to weaker models with two components: (1) Skill-based data selection, which prioritizes examples targeting the student model's weaker skills, and (2) Skill-aware fine-tuning, which encourages explicit skill decomposition during problem solving. With only 1,000 training examples selected from a 100K teacher-generated corpus, our method surpasses random SFT baselines by +1.6% on Qwen3-4B and +1.4% on Qwen3-8B across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Further analysis confirms that these gains concentrate on skills emphasized during training, highlighting the effectiveness of skill-centric training for efficient reasoning distillation.</description>

      <title>Role-Playing Agents Driven by Large Language Models: Current Status, Challenges, and Future Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), role-playing language agents (RPLAs) have emerged as a prominent research focus at the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and human-computer interaction. This paper systematically reviews the current development and key technologies of RPLAs, delineating the technological evolution from early rule-based template paradigms, through the language style imitation stage, to the cognitive simulation stage centered on personality modeling and memory mechanisms. It summarizes the critical technical pathways supporting high-quality role-playing, including psychological scale-driven character modeling, memory-augmented prompting mechanisms, and motivation-situation-based behavioral decision control. At the data level, the paper further analyzes the methods and challenges of constructing role-specific corpora, focusing on data sources, copyright constraints, and structured annotation processes. In terms of evaluation, it collates multi-dimensional assessment frameworks and benchmark datasets covering role knowledge, personality fidelity, value alignment, and interactive hallucination, while commenting on the advantages and disadvantages of methods such as human evaluation, reward models, and LLM-based scoring. Finally, the paper outlines future development directions of role-playing agents, including personality evolution modeling, multi-agent collaborative narrative, multimodal immersive interaction, and integration with cognitive neuroscience, aiming to provide a systematic perspective and methodological insights for subsequent research.</description>

      <title>ToolSafe: Enhancing Tool Invocation Safety of LLM-based agents via Proactive Step-level Guardrail and Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While LLM-based agents can interact with environments via invoking external tools, their expanded capabilities also amplify security risks. Monitoring step-level tool invocation behaviors in real time and proactively intervening before unsafe execution is critical for agent deployment, yet remains under-explored. In this work, we first construct TS-Bench, a novel benchmark for step-level tool invocation safety detection in LLM agents. We then develop a guardrail model, TS-Guard, using multi-task reinforcement learning. The model proactively detects unsafe tool invocation actions before execution by reasoning over the interaction history. It assesses request harmfulness and action-attack correlations, producing interpretable and generalizable safety judgments and feedback. Furthermore, we introduce TS-Flow, a guardrail-feedback-driven reasoning framework for LLM agents, which reduces harmful tool invocations of ReAct-style agents by 65 percent on average and improves benign task completion by approximately 10 percent under prompt injection attacks.</description>

      <title>What Gets Activated: Uncovering Domain and Driver Experts in MoE Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most interpretability work focuses on layer- or neuron-level mechanisms in Transformers, leaving expert-level behavior in MoE LLMs underexplored. Motivated by functional specialization in the human brain, we analyze expert activation by distinguishing domain and driver experts. In this work, we study expert activation in MoE models across three public domains and address two key questions: (1) which experts are activated, and whether certain expert types exhibit consistent activation patterns; and (2) how tokens are associated with and trigger the activation of specific experts. To answer these questions, we introduce entropy-based and causal-effect metrics to assess whether an expert is strongly favored for a particular domain, and how strongly expert activation contributes causally to the model's output, thus identify domain and driver experts, respectively. Furthermore, we explore how individual tokens are associated with the activation of specific experts. Our analysis reveals that (1) Among the activated experts, some show clear domain preferences, while others exert strong causal influence on model performance, underscoring their decisive roles. (2) tokens occurring earlier in a sentence are more likely to trigger the driver experts, and (3) adjusting the weights of domain and driver experts leads to significant performance gains across all three models and domains. These findings shed light on the internal mechanisms of MoE models and enhance their interpretability.</description>

Abstract: Pretraining corpora contain extensive discourse about AI systems, yet the causal influence of this discourse on downstream alignment remains poorly understood. If prevailing descriptions of AI behaviour are predominantly negative, LLMs may internalise corresponding behavioural priors, giving rise to self-fulfilling misalignment. This paper provides the first controlled study of this hypothesis by pretraining 6.9B-parameter LLMs with varying amounts of (mis)alignment discourse. We find that discussion of AI contributes to misalignment. Upsampling synthetic training documents about AI misalignment leads to a notable increase in misaligned behaviour. Conversely, upsampling documents about aligned behaviour reduces misalignment scores from 45% to 9%. We consider this evidence of self-fulfilling alignment. These effects are dampened, but persist through post-training. Our findings establish the study of how pretraining data shapes alignment priors, or alignment pretraining, as a complement to post-training. We recommend practitioners pretrain for alignment as well as capabilities. Our models and datasets are available at alignmentpretraining.ai</description>

      <title>AWED-FiNER: Agents, Web applications, and Expert Detectors for Fine-grained Named Entity Recognition across 36 Languages for 6.6 Billion Speakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce AWED-FiNER, an open-source ecosystem designed to bridge the gap in Fine-grained Named Entity Recognition (FgNER) for 36 global languages spoken by more than 6.6 billion people. While Large Language Models (LLMs) dominate general Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, they often struggle with low-resource languages and fine-grained NLP tasks. AWED-FiNER provides a collection of agentic toolkits, web applications, and several state-of-the-art expert models that provides FgNER solutions across 36 languages. The agentic tools enable to route multilingual text to specialized expert models and fetch FgNER annotations within seconds. The web-based platforms provide ready-to-use FgNER annotation service for non-technical users. Moreover, the collection of language specific extremely small sized open-source state-of-the-art expert models facilitate offline deployment in resource contraint scenerios including edge devices. AWED-FiNER covers languages spoken by over 6.6 billion people, including a specific focus on vulnerable languages such as Bodo, Manipuri, Bishnupriya, and Mizo. The resources can be accessed here: Agentic Tool (https://github.com/PrachuryyaKaushik/AWED-FiNER), Web Application (https://hf.co/spaces/prachuryyaIITG/AWED-FiNER), and 49 Expert Detector Models (https://hf.co/collections/prachuryyaIITG/awed-finer).</description>

      <title>Credit C-GPT: A Domain-Specialized Large Language Model for Conversational Understanding in Vietnamese Debt Collection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Debt collection is a critical function within the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector, relying heavily on large-scale human-to-human conversational interactions conducted primarily in Vietnamese contact centers. These conversations involve informal spoken language, emotional variability, and complex domain-specific reasoning, which pose significant challenges for traditional natural language processing systems. This paper introduces Credit C-GPT, a domain-specialized large language model with seven billion parameters, fine-tuned for conversational understanding in Vietnamese debt collection scenarios. The proposed model integrates multiple conversational intelligence tasks, including dialogue understanding, sentiment recognition, intent detection, call stage classification, and structured slot-value extraction, within a single reasoning-based framework. We describe the data construction process, annotation strategy, and training methodology, and evaluate the model on proprietary human-annotated datasets. Experimental results show consistent improvements over traditional pipeline-based approaches, indicating that domain-specialized conversational language models provide a scalable and privacy-aware solution for real-time assistance and post-call analytics in enterprise contact centers.</description>

      <title>HOMURA: Taming the Sand-Glass for Time-Constrained LLM Translation via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable strides in multilingual translation but are hindered by a systemic cross-lingual verbosity bias, rendering them unsuitable for strict time-constrained tasks like subtitling and dubbing. Current prompt-engineering approaches struggle to resolve this conflict between semantic fidelity and rigid temporal feasibility. To bridge this gap, we first introduce Sand-Glass, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate translation under syllable-level duration constraints. Furthermore, we propose HOMURA, a reinforcement learning framework that explicitly optimizes the trade-off between semantic preservation and temporal compliance. By employing a KL-regularized objective with a novel dynamic syllable-ratio reward, HOMURA effectively "tames" the output length. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms strong LLM baselines, achieving precise length control that respects linguistic density hierarchies without compromising semantic adequacy.</description>

      <title>HUMANLLM: Benchmarking and Reinforcing LLM Anthropomorphism via Human Cognitive Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning and generation, serving as the foundation for advanced persona simulation and Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs). However, achieving authentic alignment with human cognitive and behavioral patterns remains a critical challenge for these agents. We present HUMANLLM, a framework treating psychological patterns as interacting causal forces. We construct 244 patterns from ~12,000 academic papers and synthesize 11,359 scenarios where 2-5 patterns reinforce, conflict, or modulate each other, with multi-turn conversations expressing inner thoughts, actions, and dialogue. Our dual-level checklists evaluate both individual pattern fidelity and emergent multi-pattern dynamics, achieving strong human alignment (r=0.91) while revealing that holistic metrics conflate simulation accuracy with social desirability. HUMANLLM-8B outperforms Qwen3-32B on multi-pattern dynamics despite 4x fewer parameters, demonstrating that authentic anthropomorphism requires cognitive modeling--simulating not just what humans do, but the psychological processes generating those behaviors.</description>

      <title>One Instruction Does Not Fit All: How Well Do Embeddings Align Personas and Instructions in Low-Resource Indian Languages?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning multilingual assistants with culturally grounded user preferences is essential for serving India's linguistically diverse population of over one billion speakers across multiple scripts. However, existing benchmarks either focus on a single language or conflate retrieval with generation, leaving open the question of whether current embedding models can encode persona-instruction compatibility without relying on response synthesis. We present a unified benchmark spanning 12 Indian languages and four evaluation tasks: monolingual and cross-lingual persona-to-instruction retrieval, reverse retrieval from instruction to persona, and binary compatibility classification. Eight multilingual embedding models are evaluated in a frozen-encoder setting with a thin logistic regression head for classification. E5-Large-Instruct achieves the highest Recall@1 of 27.4\% on monolingual retrieval and 20.7\% on cross-lingual transfer, while BGE-M3 leads reverse retrieval at 32.1\% Recall@1. For classification, LaBSE attains 75.3\% AUROC with strong calibration. These findings offer practical guidance for model selection in Indic multilingual retrieval and establish reproducible baselines for future work\footnote{Code, datasets, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/aryashah2k/PI-Indic-Align.</description>

      <title>GeoSteer: Faithful Chain-of-Thought Steering via Latent Manifold Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved multi-step reasoning. Most approaches rely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Previous studies have shown that LLMs often generate logically inconsistent reasoning steps even when their final answers are correct. These inconsistencies reduce the reliability of step-level reasoning. We propose GeoSteer, a manifold-based framework that improves the quality of intermediate reasoning. The method consists of: (1) constructing a CoT dataset with segment-level scores, (2) training a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model and a quality estimation model to learn a low-dimensional manifold of high-quality CoT trajectories, and (3) steering hidden states of target LLMs toward higher-quality regions in the latent space. This update in a latent space behaves like a natural-gradient adjustment in the original hidden-state space. It ensures geometrically coherent steering. We evaluate GeoSteer on the GSM8k dataset using the Qwen3 series. We measure via answer accuracy and overall reasoning performance. GeoSteer improved the exact match accuracy by up to 2.6 points. It also enhanced the pairwise win rate by 5.3 points. These results indicate that GeoSteer provides an effective and controllable mechanism for improving the quality of intermediate reasoning in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Loop as a Bridge: Can Looped Transformers Truly Link Representation Space and Natural Language Outputs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit a gap between their internal knowledge and their explicit linguistic outputs. In this report, we empirically investigate whether Looped Transformers (LTs)--architectures that increase computational depth by iterating shared layers--can bridge this gap by utilizing their iterative nature as a form of introspection. Our experiments reveal that while increasing loop iterations narrows the gap, it is partly driven by a degradation of their internal knowledge carried by representations. Moreover, another empirical analysis suggests that current LTs' ability to perceive representations does not improve across loops; it is only present in the final loop. These results suggest that while LTs offer a promising direction for scaling computational depth, they have yet to achieve the introspection required to truly link representation space and natural language.</description>

      <title>coTherapist: A Behavior-Aligned Small Language Model to Support Mental Healthcare Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access to mental healthcare is increasingly strained by workforce shortages and rising demand, motivating the development of intelligent systems that can support mental healthcare experts. We introduce coTherapist, a unified framework utilizing a small language model to emulate core therapeutic competencies through domain-specific fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, and agentic reasoning. Evaluation on clinical queries demonstrates that coTherapist generates more relevant and clinically grounded responses than contemporary baselines. Using our novel T-BARS rubric and psychometric profiling, we confirm coTherapist exhibits high empathy and therapist-consistent personality traits. Furthermore, human evaluation by domain experts validates that coTherapist delivers accurate, trustworthy, and safe responses. coTherapist was deployed and tested by clinical experts. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that small models can be engineered to exhibit expert-like behavior, offering a scalable pathway for digital mental health tools.</description>

      <title>Untangling Input Language from Reasoning Language: A Diagnostic Framework for Cross-Lingual Moral Alignment in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When LLMs judge moral dilemmas, do they reach different conclusions in different languages, and if so, why? Two factors could drive such differences: the language of the dilemma itself, or the language in which the model reasons. Standard evaluation conflates these by testing only matched conditions (e.g., English dilemma with English reasoning). We introduce a methodology that separately manipulates each factor, covering also mismatched conditions (e.g., English dilemma with Chinese reasoning), enabling decomposition of their contributions. To study \emph{what} changes, we propose an approach to interpret the moral judgments in terms of Moral Foundations Theory. As a side result, we identify evidence for splitting the Authority dimension into a family-related and an institutional dimension. Applying this methodology to English-Chinese moral judgment with 13 LLMs, we demonstrate its diagnostic power: (1) the framework isolates reasoning-language effects as contributing twice the variance of input-language effects; (2) it detects context-dependency in nearly half of models that standard evaluation misses; and (3) a diagnostic taxonomy translates these patterns into deployment guidance. We release our code and datasets at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CrossCulturalMoralJudgement.</description>

      <title>Measuring Affinity between Attention-Head Weight Subspaces via the Projection Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding relationships between attention heads is essential for interpreting the internal structure of Transformers, yet existing metrics do not capture this structure well. We focus on the subspaces spanned by attention-head weight matrices and quantify head-to-head relationships using the Projection Kernel (PK), a principal-angle-based measure of subspace similarity. Experiments show that PK reproduces known head-to-head interactions on the IOI task more clearly than prior metrics such as the Composition Score. We further introduce a framework to quantify the informativeness of PK distributions by comparing them with a reference distribution derived from random orthogonal subspaces. As an application, we analyze a directed graph constructed from PK and show that, in GPT2-small, L4H7 acts as a hub by functioning as an identity head.</description>

      <title>MoST: Mixing Speech and Text with Modality-Aware Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MoST (Mixture of Speech and Text), a novel multimodal large language model that seamlessly integrates speech and text processing through our proposed Modality-Aware Mixture of Experts (MAMoE) architecture. While current multimodal models typically process diverse modality representations with identical parameters, disregarding their inherent representational differences, we introduce specialized routing pathways that direct tokens to modality-appropriate experts based on input type. MAMoE simultaneously enhances modality-specific learning and cross-modal understanding through two complementary components: modality-specific expert groups that capture domain-specific patterns and shared experts that facilitate information transfer between modalities. Building on this architecture, we develop an efficient transformation pipeline that adapts the pretrained MoE language model through strategic post-training on ASR and TTS datasets, followed by fine-tuning with a carefully curated speech-text instruction dataset. A key feature of this pipeline is that it relies exclusively on fully accessible, open-source datasets to achieve strong performance and data efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations across ASR, TTS, audio language modeling, and spoken question answering benchmarks show that MoST consistently outperforms existing models of comparable parameter counts. Our ablation studies confirm that the modality-specific routing mechanism and shared experts design significantly contribute to performance gains across all tested domains. To our knowledge, MoST represents the first fully open-source speech-text LLM built on a Mixture of Experts architecture. \footnote{We release MoST model, training code, inference code, and training data at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/MoST</description>

      <title>The Straight and Narrow: Do LLMs Possess an Internal Moral Path?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the moral alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical challenge in AI safety. Current alignment techniques often act as superficial guardrails, leaving the intrinsic moral representations of LLMs largely untouched. In this paper, we bridge this gap by leveraging Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) to map and manipulate the fine-grained moral landscape of LLMs. Through cross-lingual linear probing, we validate the shared nature of moral representations in middle layers and uncover a shared yet different moral subspace between English and Chinese. Building upon this, we extract steerable Moral Vectors and successfully validate their efficacy at both internal and behavioral levels. Leveraging the high generalizability of morality, we propose Adaptive Moral Fusion (AMF), a dynamic inference-time intervention that synergizes probe detection with vector injection to tackle the safety-helpfulness trade-off. Empirical results confirm that our approach acts as a targeted intrinsic defense, effectively reducing incorrect refusals on benign queries while minimizing jailbreak success rates compared to standard baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We approach multilinguality as sense adaptation: aligning latent meaning representations across languages rather than relying solely on shared parameters and scale. In this paper, we introduce SENse-based Symmetric Interlingual Alignment (SENSIA), which adapts a Backpack language model from one language to another by explicitly aligning sense-level mixtures and contextual representations on parallel data, while jointly training a target-language language modeling loss to preserve fluency. Across benchmarks on four typologically diverse languages, SENSIA generally outperforms comparable multilingual alignment methods and achieves competitive accuracy against monolingual from-scratch baselines while using 2-4x less target-language data. Analyses of learned sense geometry indicate that local sense topology and global structure relative to English are largely preserved, and ablations show that the method is robust in terms of design and scale.</description>

Abstract: As large-scale speech-to-speech models achieve high fidelity, the distinction between synthetic voices in structured environments becomes a vital area of study. This paper introduces Advosynth-500, a specialized dataset comprising 100 synthetic speech files featuring 10 unique advocate identities. Using the Speech Llama Omni model, we simulate five distinct advocate pairs engaged in courtroom arguments. We define specific vocal characteristics for each advocate and present a speaker identification challenge to evaluate the ability of modern systems to map audio files to their respective synthetic origins.

      <title>Boundary-Aware NL2SQL: Integrating Reliability through Hybrid Reward and Data Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present BAR-SQL (Boundary-Aware Reliable NL2SQL), a unified training framework that embeds reliability and boundary awareness directly into the generation process. We introduce a Seed Mutation data synthesis paradigm that constructs a representative enterprise corpus, explicitly encompassing multi-step analytical queries alongside boundary cases including ambiguity and schema limitations. To ensure interpretability, we employ Knowledge-Grounded Reasoning Synthesis, which produces Chain-of-Thought traces explicitly anchored in schema metadata and business rules. The model is trained through a two-stage process: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization. We design a Task-Conditioned Hybrid Reward mechanism that simultaneously optimizes SQL execution accuracy-leveraging Abstract Syntax Tree analysis and dense result matching-and semantic precision in abstention responses. To evaluate reliability alongside generation accuracy, we construct and release Ent-SQL-Bench, which jointly assesse SQL precision and boundary-aware abstention across ambiguous and unanswerable queries. Experimental results on this benchmark demonstrate that BAR-SQL achieves 91.48% average accuracy, outperforming leading proprietary models, including Claude 4.5 Sonnet and GPT-5, in both SQL generation quality and boundary-aware abstention capability.

      <title>An Efficient Long-Context Ranking Architecture With Calibrated LLM Distillation: Application to Person-Job Fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding the most relevant person for a job proposal in real time is challenging, especially when resumes are long, structured, and multilingual. In this paper, we propose a re-ranking model based on a new generation of late cross-attention architecture, that decomposes both resumes and project briefs to efficiently handle long-context inputs with minimal computational overhead. To mitigate historical data biases, we use a generative large language model (LLM) as a teacher, generating fine-grained, semantically grounded supervision. This signal is distilled into our student model via an enriched distillation loss function. The resulting model produces skill-fit scores that enable consistent and interpretable person-job matching. Experiments on relevance, ranking, and calibration metrics demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>OctoBench: Benchmarking Scaffold-Aware Instruction Following in Repository-Grounded Agentic Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern coding scaffolds turn LLMs into capable software agents, but their ability to follow scaffold-specified instructions remains under-examined, especially when constraints are heterogeneous and persist across interactions. To fill this gap, we introduce OctoBench, which benchmarks scaffold-aware instruction following in repository-grounded agentic coding. OctoBench includes 34 environments and 217 tasks instantiated under three scaffold types, and is paired with 7,098 objective checklist items. To disentangle solving the task from following the rules, we provide an automated observation-and-scoring toolkit that captures full trajectories and performs fine-grained checks. Experiments on eight representative models reveal a systematic gap between task-solving and scaffold-aware compliance, underscoring the need for training and evaluation that explicitly targets heterogeneous instruction following. We release the benchmark to support reproducible benchmarking and to accelerate the development of more scaffold-aware coding agents.</description>

      <title>Training-Trajectory-Aware Token Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient distillation is a key pathway for converting expensive reasoning capability into deployable efficiency, yet in the frontier regime where the student already has strong reasoning ability, naive continual distillation often yields limited gains or even degradation. We observe a characteristic training phenomenon: even as loss decreases monotonically, all performance metrics can drop sharply at almost the same bottleneck, before gradually recovering. We further uncover a token-level mechanism: confidence bifurcates into steadily increasing Imitation-Anchor Tokens that quickly anchor optimization and other yet-to-learn tokens whose confidence is suppressed until after the bottleneck. And the characteristic that these two types of tokens cannot coexist is the root cause of the failure in continual distillation. To this end, we propose Training-Trajectory-Aware Token Selection (T3S) to reconstruct the training objective at the token level, clearing the optimization path for yet-to-learn tokens. T3 yields consistent gains in both AR and dLLM settings: with only hundreds of examples, Qwen3-8B surpasses DeepSeek-R1 on competitive reasoning benchmarks, Qwen3-32B approaches Qwen3-235B, and T3-trained LLaDA-2.0-Mini exceeds its AR baseline, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all of 16B-scale no-think models.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Implicit Experience: Synthesizing Tool-Use Trajectories from Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively utilize tools in multi-turn interactions is essential for building capable autonomous agents. However, acquiring diverse and realistic multi-turn tool-use data remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel text-based paradigm. We observe that textual corpora naturally contain rich, multi-step problem-solving experiences, which can serve as an untapped, scalable, and authentic data source for multi-turn tool-use tasks. Based on this insight, we introduce GEM, a data synthesis pipeline that enables the generation and extraction of multi-turn tool-use trajectories from text corpora through a four-stage process: relevance filtering, workflow &amp; tool extraction, trajectory grounding, and complexity refinement. To reduce the computational cost, we further train a specialized Trajectory Synthesizer via supervised fine-tuning. This model distills the complex generation pipeline into an efficient, end-to-end trajectory generator. Experiments demonstrate that our GEM-32B achieve a 16.5% improvement on the BFCL V3 Multi-turn benchmark. Our models partially surpass the performance of models trained on {\tau} - bench (Airline and Retail) in-domain data, highlighting the superior generalization capability derived from our text-based synthesis paradigm. Notably, our Trajectory Synthesizer matches the quality of the full pipeline while significantly reducing inference latency and costs.</description>

      <title>The Assistant Axis: Situating and Stabilizing the Default Persona of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models can represent a variety of personas but typically default to a helpful Assistant identity cultivated during post-training. We investigate the structure of the space of model personas by extracting activation directions corresponding to diverse character archetypes. Across several different models, we find that the leading component of this persona space is an "Assistant Axis," which captures the extent to which a model is operating in its default Assistant mode. Steering towards the Assistant direction reinforces helpful and harmless behavior; steering away increases the model's tendency to identify as other entities. Moreover, steering away with more extreme values often induces a mystical, theatrical speaking style. We find this axis is also present in pre-trained models, where it primarily promotes helpful human archetypes like consultants and coaches and inhibits spiritual ones. Measuring deviations along the Assistant Axis predicts "persona drift," a phenomenon where models slip into exhibiting harmful or bizarre behaviors that are uncharacteristic of their typical persona. We find that persona drift is often driven by conversations demanding meta-reflection on the model's processes or featuring emotionally vulnerable users. We show that restricting activations to a fixed region along the Assistant Axis can stabilize model behavior in these scenarios -- and also in the face of adversarial persona-based jailbreaks. Our results suggest that post-training steers models toward a particular region of persona space but only loosely tethers them to it, motivating work on training and steering strategies that more deeply anchor models to a coherent persona.</description>

      <title>INDIC DIALECT: A Multi Task Benchmark to Evaluate and Translate in Indian Language Dialects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent NLP advances focus primarily on standardized languages, leaving most low-resource dialects under-served especially in Indian scenarios. In India, the issue is particularly important: despite Hindi being the third most spoken language globally (over 600 million speakers), its numerous dialects remain underrepresented. The situation is similar for Odia, which has around 45 million speakers. While some datasets exist which contain standard Hindi and Odia languages, their regional dialects have almost no web presence. We introduce INDIC-DIALECT, a human-curated parallel corpus of 13k sentence pairs spanning 11 dialects and 2 languages: Hindi and Odia. Using this corpus, we construct a multi-task benchmark with three tasks: dialect classification, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and machine translation (MT). Our experiments show that LLMs like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 perform poorly on the classification task. While fine-tuned transformer based models pretrained on Indian languages substantially improve performance e.g., improving F1 from 19.6\% to 89.8\% on dialect classification. For dialect to language translation, we find that hybrid AI model achieves highest BLEU score of 61.32 compared to the baseline score of 23.36. Interestingly, due to complexity in generating dialect sentences, we observe that for language to dialect translation the ``rule-based followed by AI" approach achieves best BLEU score of 48.44 compared to the baseline score of 27.59. INDIC-DIALECT thus is a new benchmark for dialect-aware Indic NLP, and we plan to release it as open source to support further work on low-resource Indian dialects.</description>

      <title>TF3-RO-50M: Training Compact Romanian Language Models from Scratch on Synthetic Moral Microfiction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in synthetic data generation have shown that compact language models can be trained effectively when the underlying corpus is structurally controlled and linguistically coherent. However, for morphologically rich and computationally under-resourced languages such as Romanian, there is still no openly documented, end-to-end pipeline that unifies tokenizer design, preprocessing, pretraining, compression, evaluation, and large-scale synthetic data generation in a reproducible framework. Building on TF1, a three-million-story English fable dataset, and TF2, which extends TF1 through high-quality Romanian translations, we introduce TF3-RO, a Romanian-centric language modeling pipeline spanning tokenizer training, from-scratch model development, and Romanian-native dataset generation. TF3-RO constructs Romanian-specific BPE and Unigram tokenizers from a linguistically informed corpus to mitigate token inflation induced by Romanian morphology. Using long-sequence packed training, we pretrain a 51.65M-parameter LLaMA-style Transformer entirely from scratch. The model is subsequently optimized through quantization, structured pruning, and logit-based knowledge distillation, yielding a compact 26.45M-parameter student model with tied embeddings and strong deployment characteristics. Using this distilled model, TF3-RO generates three million Romanian-native synthetic fables via a controlled combinatorial prompting framework. Across all stages, the pipeline integrates a comprehensive evaluation suite combining intrinsic metrics, Romanian agreement probes, entity coherence, rule-based grammar checking, and LLM-based assessment. TF3-RO provides a reproducible and linguistically grounded framework for training compact Romanian language models and producing large-scale synthetic narrative corpora.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Futrell and Mahowald claim LMs "serve as model systems", but an assessment at each of Marr's three levels suggests the claim is clearly not true at the implementation level, poorly motivated at the algorithmic-representational level, and problematic at the computational theory level. LMs are good candidates as tools; calling them cognitive models overstates the case and unnecessarily feeds LLM hype.</description>

      <title>SurgGoal: Rethinking Surgical Planning Evaluation via Goal-Satisfiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surgical planning integrates visual perception, long-horizon reasoning, and procedural knowledge, yet it remains unclear whether current evaluation protocols reliably assess vision-language models (VLMs) in safety-critical settings. Motivated by a goal-oriented view of surgical planning, we define planning correctness via phase-goal satisfiability, where plan validity is determined by expert-defined surgical rules. Based on this definition, we introduce a multicentric meta-evaluation benchmark with valid procedural variations and invalid plans containing order and content errors. Using this benchmark, we show that sequence similarity metrics systematically misjudge planning quality, penalizing valid plans while failing to identify invalid ones. We therefore adopt a rule-based goal-satisfiability metric as a high-precision meta-evaluation reference to assess Video-LLMs under progressively constrained settings, revealing failures due to perception errors and under-constrained reasoning. Structural knowledge consistently improves performance, whereas semantic guidance alone is unreliable and benefits larger models only when combined with structural constraints.</description>

      <title>Contextual StereoSet: Stress-Testing Bias Alignment Robustness in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model that avoids stereotypes in a lab benchmark may not avoid them in deployment. We show that measured bias shifts dramatically when prompts mention different places, times, or audiences -- no adversarial prompting required.
  We introduce Contextual StereoSet, a benchmark that holds stereotype content fixed while systematically varying contextual framing. Testing 13 models across two protocols, we find striking patterns: anchoring to 1990 (vs. 2030) raises stereotype selection in all models tested on this contrast (p&lt;0.05); gossip framing raises it in 5 of 6 full-grid models; out-group observer framing shifts it by up to 13 percentage points. These effects replicate in hiring, lending, and help-seeking vignettes.
  We propose Context Sensitivity Fingerprints (CSF): a compact profile of per-dimension dispersion and paired contrasts with bootstrap CIs and FDR correction. Two evaluation tracks support different use cases -- a 360-context diagnostic grid for deep analysis and a budgeted protocol covering 4,229 items for production screening.
  The implication is methodological: bias scores from fixed-condition tests may not generalize.This is not a claim about ground-truth bias rates; it is a stress test of evaluation robustness. CSF forces evaluators to ask, "Under what conditions does bias appear?" rather than "Is this model biased?" We release our benchmark, code, and results.</description>

      <title>DR-Arena: an Automated Evaluation Framework for Deep Research Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly operate as Deep Research (DR) Agents capable of autonomous investigation and information synthesis, reliable evaluation of their task performance has become a critical bottleneck. Current benchmarks predominantly rely on static datasets, which suffer from several limitations: limited task generality, temporal misalignment, and data contamination. To address these, we introduce DR-Arena, a fully automated evaluation framework that pushes DR agents to their capability limits through dynamic investigation. DR-Arena constructs real-time Information Trees from fresh web trends to ensure the evaluation rubric is synchronized with the live world state, and employs an automated Examiner to generate structured tasks testing two orthogonal capabilities: Deep reasoning and Wide coverage. DR-Arena further adopts Adaptive Evolvement Loop, a state-machine controller that dynamically escalates task complexity based on real-time performance, demanding deeper deduction or wider aggregation until a decisive capability boundary emerges. Experiments with six advanced DR agents demonstrate that DR-Arena achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.94 with the LMSYS Search Arena leaderboard. This represents the state-of-the-art alignment with human preferences without any manual efforts, validating DR-Arena as a reliable alternative for costly human adjudication.</description>

      <title>AEQ-Bench: Measuring Empathy of Omni-Modal Large Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the automatic evaluation of omni-modal large models (OLMs) is essential, assessing empathy remains a significant challenge due to its inherent affectivity. To investigate this challenge, we introduce AEQ-Bench (Audio Empathy Quotient Benchmark), a novel benchmark to systematically assess two core empathetic capabilities of OLMs: (i) generating empathetic responses by comprehending affective cues from multi-modal inputs (audio + text), and (ii) judging the empathy of audio responses without relying on text transcription. Compared to existing benchmarks, AEQ-Bench incorporates two novel settings that vary in context specificity and speech tone. Comprehensive assessment across linguistic and paralinguistic metrics reveals that (1) OLMs trained with audio output capabilities generally outperformed models with text-only outputs, and (2) while OLMs align with human judgments for coarse-grained quality assessment, they remain unreliable for evaluating fine-grained paralinguistic expressiveness.</description>

      <title>PERM: Psychology-grounded Empathetic Reward Modeling for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in human-centric applications, yet they often fail to provide substantive emotional support. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been utilized to enhance empathy of LLMs, existing reward models typically evaluate empathy from a single perspective, overlooking the inherently bidirectional interaction nature of empathy between the supporter and seeker as defined by Empathy Cycle theory. To address this limitation, we propose Psychology-grounded Empathetic Reward Modeling (PERM). PERM operationalizes empathy evaluation through a bidirectional decomposition: 1) Supporter perspective, assessing internal resonation and communicative expression; 2) Seeker perspective, evaluating emotional reception. Additionally, it incorporates a bystander perspective to monitor overall interaction quality. Extensive experiments on a widely-used emotional intelligence benchmark and an industrial daily conversation dataset demonstrate that PERM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 10\%. Furthermore, a blinded user study reveals a 70\% preference for our approach, highlighting its efficacy in generating more empathetic responses. Our code, dataset, and models are available at https://github.com/ZhengWwwq/PERM.</description>

      <title>Representation-Aware Unlearning via Activation Signatures: From Suppression to Knowledge-Signature Erasure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective knowledge erasure from LLMs is critical for GDPR compliance and model safety, yet current unlearning methods conflate behavioral suppression with true knowledge removal, allowing latent capabilities to persist beneath surface-level refusals. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing Knowledge Immunization Framework (KIF), a representation-aware architecture that distinguishes genuine erasure from obfuscation by targeting internal activation signatures rather than surface outputs. Our approach combines dynamic suppression of subject-specific representations with parameter-efficient adaptation, enabling durable unlearning without full model retraining. KIF achieves near-oracle erasure (FQ approx 0.99 vs. 1.00) while preserving utility at oracle levels (MU = 0.62), effectively breaking the stability-erasure tradeoff that has constrained all prior work. We evaluate both standard foundation models (Llama and Mistral) and reasoning-prior models (Qwen and DeepSeek) across 3B to 14B parameters. Our observation shows that standard models exhibit scale-independent true erasure (&lt;3% utility drift), while reasoning-prior models reveal fundamental architectural divergence. Our comprehensive dual-metric evaluation protocol, combining surface-level leakage with latent trace persistence, operationalizes the obfuscation - erasure distinction and enables the first systematic diagnosis of mechanism-level forgetting behavior across model families and scales.</description>

      <title>Form and Meaning in Intrinsic Multilingual Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic evaluation metrics for conditional language models, such as perplexity or bits-per-character, are widely used in both mono- and multilingual settings. These metrics are rather straightforward to use and compare in monolingual setups, but rest on a number of assumptions in multilingual setups. One such assumption is that comparing the perplexity of CLMs on parallel sentences is indicative of their quality since the information content (here understood as the semantic meaning) is the same. However, the metrics are inherently measuring information content in the information-theoretic sense. We make this and other such assumptions explicit and discuss their implications. We perform experiments with six metrics on two multi-parallel corpora both with mono- and multilingual models. Ultimately, we find that current metrics are not universally comparable. We look at the form-meaning debate to provide some explanation for this.</description>

      <title>Influential Training Data Retrieval for Explaining Verbalized Confidence of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can increase users' perceived trust by verbalizing confidence in their outputs. However, prior work has shown that LLMs are often overconfident, making their stated confidence unreliable since it does not consistently align with factual accuracy. To better understand the sources of this verbalized confidence, we introduce TracVC (\textbf{Trac}ing \textbf{V}erbalized \textbf{C}onfidence), a method that builds on information retrieval and influence estimation to trace generated confidence expressions back to the training data. We evaluate TracVC on OLMo and Llama models in a question answering setting, proposing a new metric, content groundness, which measures the extent to which an LLM grounds its confidence in content-related training examples (relevant to the question and answer) versus in generic examples of confidence verbalization. Our analysis reveals that OLMo2-13B is frequently influenced by confidence-related data that is lexically unrelated to the query, suggesting that it may mimic superficial linguistic expressions of certainty rather than rely on genuine content grounding. These findings point to a fundamental limitation in current training regimes: LLMs may learn how to sound confident without learning when confidence is justified. Our analysis provides a foundation for improving LLMs' trustworthiness in expressing more reliable confidence.</description>

      <title>Detecting Winning Arguments with Large Language Models and Persuasion Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting persuasion in argumentative text is a challenging task with important implications for understanding human communication. This work investigates the role of persuasion strategies - such as Attack on reputation, Distraction, and Manipulative wording - in determining the persuasiveness of a text. We conduct experiments on three annotated argument datasets: Winning Arguments (built from the Change My View subreddit), Anthropic/Persuasion, and Persuasion for Good. Our approach leverages large language models (LLMs) with a Multi-Strategy Persuasion Scoring approach that guides reasoning over six persuasion strategies. Results show that strategy-guided reasoning improves the prediction of persuasiveness. To better understand the influence of content, we organize the Winning Argument dataset into broad discussion topics and analyze performance across them. We publicly release this topic-annotated version of the dataset to facilitate future research. Overall, our methodology demonstrates the value of structured, strategy-aware prompting for enhancing interpretability and robustness in argument quality assessment.</description>

      <title>LIBERTy: A Causal Framework for Benchmarking Concept-Based Explanations of LLMs with Structural Counterfactuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept-based explanations quantify how high-level concepts (e.g., gender or experience) influence model behavior, which is crucial for decision-makers in high-stakes domains. Recent work evaluates the faithfulness of such explanations by comparing them to reference causal effects estimated from counterfactuals. In practice, existing benchmarks rely on costly human-written counterfactuals that serve as an imperfect proxy. To address this, we introduce a framework for constructing datasets containing structural counterfactual pairs: LIBERTy (LLM-based Interventional Benchmark for Explainability with Reference Targets). LIBERTy is grounded in explicitly defined Structured Causal Models (SCMs) of the text generation, interventions on a concept propagate through the SCM until an LLM generates the counterfactual. We introduce three datasets (disease detection, CV screening, and workplace violence prediction) together with a new evaluation metric, order-faithfulness. Using them, we evaluate a wide range of methods across five models and identify substantial headroom for improving concept-based explanations. LIBERTy also enables systematic analysis of model sensitivity to interventions: we find that proprietary LLMs show markedly reduced sensitivity to demographic concepts, likely due to post-training mitigation. Overall, LIBERTy provides a much-needed benchmark for developing faithful explainability methods.</description>

      <title>Grounding Agent Memory in Contextual Intent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying large language models in long-horizon, goal-oriented interactions remains challenging because similar entities and facts recur under different latent goals and constraints, causing memory systems to retrieve context-mismatched evidence. We propose STITCH (Structured Intent Tracking in Contextual History), an agentic memory system that indexes each trajectory step with a structured retrieval cue, contextual intent, and retrieves history by matching the current step's intent. Contextual intent provides compact signals that disambiguate repeated mentions and reduce interference: (1) the current latent goal defining a thematic segment, (2) the action type, and (3) the salient entity types anchoring which attributes matter. During inference, STITCH filters and prioritizes memory snippets by intent compatibility, suppressing semantically similar but context-incompatible history.
  For evaluation, we introduce CAME-Bench, a benchmark for context-aware retrieval in realistic, dynamic, goal-oriented trajectories. Across CAME-Bench and LongMemEval, STITCH achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 35.6%, with the largest gains as trajectory length increases. Our analysis shows that intent indexing substantially reduces retrieval noise, supporting intent-aware memory for robust long-horizon reasoning.</description>

      <title>MatchTIR: Fine-Grained Supervision for Tool-Integrated Reasoning via Bipartite Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) empowers large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks by interleaving reasoning steps with external tool interactions. However, existing reinforcement learning methods typically rely on outcome- or trajectory-level rewards, assigning uniform advantages to all steps within a trajectory. This coarse-grained credit assignment fails to distinguish effective tool calls from redundant or erroneous ones, particularly in long-horizon multi-turn scenarios. To address this, we propose MatchTIR, a framework that introduces fine-grained supervision via bipartite matching-based turn-level reward assignment and dual-level advantage estimation. Specifically, we formulate credit assignment as a bipartite matching problem between predicted and ground-truth traces, utilizing two assignment strategies to derive dense turn-level rewards. Furthermore, to balance local step precision with global task success, we introduce a dual-level advantage estimation scheme that integrates turn-level and trajectory-level signals, assigning distinct advantage values to individual interaction turns. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MatchTIR. Notably, our 4B model surpasses the majority of 8B competitors, particularly in long-horizon and multi-turn tasks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/quchangle1/MatchTIR.</description>

      <title>Social Determinants of Health Prediction for ICD-9 Code with Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social Determinants of Health correlate with patient outcomes but are rarely captured in structured data. Recent attention has been given to automatically extracting these markers from clinical text to supplement diagnostic systems with knowledge of patients' social circumstances. Large language models demonstrate strong performance in identifying Social Determinants of Health labels from sentences. However, prediction in large admissions or longitudinal notes is challenging given long distance dependencies. In this paper, we explore hospital admission multi-label Social Determinants of Health ICD-9 code classification on the MIMIC-III dataset using reasoning models and traditional large language models. We exploit existing ICD-9 codes for prediction on admissions, which achieved an 89% F1. Our contributions include our findings, missing SDoH codes in 139 admissions, and code to reproduce the results.</description>

      <title>Multi-Level Embedding Conformer Framework for Bengali Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bengali, spoken by over 300 million people, is a morphologically rich and lowresource language, posing challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR). This research presents an end-to-end framework for Bengali ASR, building on a Conformer-CTC backbone with a multi-level embedding fusion mechanism that incorporates phoneme, syllable, and wordpiece representations. By enriching acoustic features with these linguistic embeddings, the model captures fine-grained phonetic cues and higher-level contextual patterns. The architecture employs early and late Conformer stages, with preprocessing steps including silence trimming, resampling, Log-Mel spectrogram extraction, and SpecAugment augmentation. The experimental results demonstrate the strong potential of the model, achieving a word error rate (WER) of 10.01% and a character error rate (CER) of 5.03%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multi-granular linguistic information with acoustic modeling, providing a scalable approach for low-resource ASR development.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data for Veterinary EHR De-identification: Benefits, Limits, and Safety Trade-offs Under Fixed Compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Veterinary electronic health records (vEHRs) contain privacy-sensitive identifiers that limit secondary use. While PetEVAL provides a benchmark for veterinary de-identification, the domain remains low-resource. This study evaluates whether large language model (LLM)-generated synthetic narratives improve de-identification safety under distinct training regimes, emphasizing (i) synthetic augmentation and (ii) fixed-budget substitution. We conducted a controlled simulation using a PetEVAL-derived corpus (3,750 holdout/1,249 train). We generated 10,382 synthetic notes using a privacy-preserving "template-only" regime where identifiers were removed prior to LLM prompting. Three transformer backbones (PetBERT, VetBERT, Bio_ClinicalBERT) were trained under varying mixtures. Evaluation prioritized document-level leakage rate (the fraction of documents with at least one missed identifier) as the primary safety outcome. Results show that under fixed-sample substitution, replacing real notes with synthetic ones monotonically increased leakage, indicating synthetic data cannot safely replace real supervision. Under compute-matched training, moderate synthetic mixing matched real-only performance, but high synthetic dominance degraded utility. Conversely, epoch-scaled augmentation improved performance: PetBERT span-overlap F1 increased from 0.831 to 0.850 +/- 0.014, and leakage decreased from 6.32% to 4.02% +/- 0.19%. However, these gains largely reflect increased training exposure rather than intrinsic synthetic data quality. Corpus diagnostics revealed systematic synthetic-real mismatches in note length and label distribution that align with persistent leakage. We conclude that synthetic augmentation is effective for expanding exposure but is complementary, not substitutive, for safety-critical veterinary de-identification.</description>

      <title>Antisocial behavior towards large language model users: experimental evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid spread of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about the social reactions they provoke. Prior research documents negative attitudes toward AI users, but it remains unclear whether such disapproval translates into costly action. We address this question in a two-phase online experiment (N = 491 Phase II participants; Phase I provided targets) where participants could spend part of their own endowment to reduce the earnings of peers who had previously completed a real-effort task with or without LLM support. On average, participants destroyed 36% of the earnings of those who relied exclusively on the model, with punishment increasing monotonically with actual LLM use. Disclosure about LLM use created a credibility gap: self-reported null use was punished more harshly than actual null use, suggesting that declarations of "no use" are treated with suspicion. Conversely, at high levels of use, actual reliance on the model was punished more strongly than self-reported reliance. Taken together, these findings provide the first behavioral evidence that the efficiency gains of LLMs come at the cost of social sanctions.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Thought: Disclosing the Transformer as a Tropical Polynomial Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Transformer self-attention mechanism in the high-confidence regime ($\beta \to \infty$, where $\beta$ is an inverse temperature) operates in the tropical semiring (max-plus algebra). In particular, we show that taking the tropical limit of the softmax attention converts it into a tropical matrix product. This reveals that the Transformer's forward pass is effectively executing a dynamic programming recurrence (specifically, a Bellman-Ford path-finding update) on a latent graph defined by token similarities. Our theoretical result provides a new geometric perspective for chain-of-thought reasoning: it emerges from an inherent shortest-path (or longest-path) algorithm being carried out within the network's computation.</description>

      <title>Thinking Long, but Short: Stable Sequential Test-Time Scaling for Large Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential test-time scaling is a promising training-free method to improve large reasoning model accuracy, but as currently implemented, significant limitations have been observed. Inducing models to think for longer can increase their accuracy, but as the length of reasoning is further extended, it has also been shown to result in accuracy degradation and model instability. This work presents a novel sequential test-time scaling method, Min-Seek, which improves model accuracy significantly over a wide range of induced thoughts, stabilizing the accuracy of sequential scaling, and removing the need for reasoning length fine-tuning. Beyond improving model accuracy over a variety of reasoning tasks, our method is inherently efficient, as only the KV pairs of one additional induced thought are kept in the KV cache during reasoning. With a custom KV cache which stores keys without position embeddings, by dynamically encoding them contiguously before each new generated thought, our method can continue to reason well beyond a model's maximum context length, and under mild conditions has linear computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Self-reflection in Automated Qualitative Coding: Improving Text Annotation through Secondary LLM Critique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) allow for sophisticated qualitative coding of large datasets, but zero- and few-shot classifiers can produce an intolerable number of errors, even with careful, validated prompting. We present a simple, generalizable two-stage workflow: an LLM applies a human-designed, LLM-adapted codebook; a secondary LLM critic performs self-reflection on each positive label by re-reading the source text alongside the first model's rationale and issuing a final decision. We evaluate this approach on six qualitative codes over 3,000 high-content emails from Apache Software Foundation project evaluation discussions. Our human-derived audit of 360 positive annotations (60 passages by six codes) found that the first-line LLM had a false-positive rate of 8% to 54%, despite F1 scores of 0.74 and 1.00 in testing. Subsequent recoding of all stage-one annotations via a second self-reflection stage improved F1 by 0.04 to 0.25, bringing two especially poor performing codes up to 0.69 and 0.79 from 0.52 and 0.55 respectively. Our manual evaluation identified two recurrent error classes: misinterpretation (violations of code definitions) and meta-discussion (debate about a project evaluation criterion mistaken for its use as a decision justification). Code-specific critic clauses addressing observed failure modes were especially effective with testing and refinement, replicating the codebook-adaption process for LLM interpretation in stage-one. We explain how favoring recall in first-line LLM annotation combined with secondary critique delivers precision-first, compute-light control. With human guidance and validation, self-reflection slots into existing LLM-assisted annotation pipelines to reduce noise and potentially salvage unusable classifiers.</description>

      <title>SPRInG: Continual LLM Personalization via Selective Parametric Adaptation and Retrieval-Interpolated Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalizing Large Language Models typically relies on static retrieval or one-time adaptation, assuming user preferences remain invariant over time. However, real-world interactions are dynamic, where user interests continuously evolve, posing a challenge for models to adapt to preference drift without catastrophic forgetting. Standard continual learning approaches often struggle in this context, as they indiscriminately update on noisy interaction streams, failing to distinguish genuine preference shifts from transient contexts. To address this, we introduce SPRInG, a novel semi-parametric framework designed for effective continual personalization. During training, SPRInG employs drift-driven selective adaptation, which utilizes a likelihood-based scoring function to identify high-novelty interactions. This allows the model to selectively update the user-specific adapter on drift signals while preserving hard-to-learn residuals in a replay buffer. During inference, we apply strict relevance gating and fuse parametric knowledge with retrieved history via logit interpolation. Experiments on the long-form personalized generation benchmark demonstrate that SPRInG outperforms existing baselines, validating its robustness for real-world continual personalization.</description>

Abstract: We present a hybrid transformer architecture that replaces discrete middle layers with a continuous-depth Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) block, enabling inference-time control over generation attributes via a learned steering signal. Unlike standard transformers that process representations through fixed discrete layers, our approach treats depth as a continuous variable governed by a learned vector field $F_\theta(H, \tau, u)$, where $u$ is a low-dimensional control signal injected via explicit concatenation. We validate the architecture through four experiments: (1) gradient flow stability with zero exploding/vanishing gradient events, (2) semantic steering achieving 98\%/88\% accuracy for positive/negative sentiment control, (3) continuous interpolation validated by a negligible 0.068\% trajectory divergence between fixed and adaptive solvers, and (4) efficiency benchmarking demonstrating latency parity with standard discrete baselines. Additionally, we show that adaptive ODE solvers reveal geometric structure in the learned dynamics: the control signal partitions the vector field into distinct dynamical regimes with different curvature characteristics. The adjoint method enables $O(1)$ memory training regardless of integration depth. Our results demonstrate that continuous-depth dynamics with learned control signals provide a viable, efficient mechanism for steerable language generation.</description>

      <title>Sparse-RL: Breaking the Memory Wall in LLM Reinforcement Learning via Stable Sparse Rollouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become essential for eliciting complex reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the substantial memory overhead of storing Key-Value (KV) caches during long-horizon rollouts acts as a critical bottleneck, often prohibiting efficient training on limited hardware. While existing KV compression techniques offer a remedy for inference, directly applying them to RL training induces a severe policy mismatch, leading to catastrophic performance collapse. To address this, we introduce Sparse-RL empowers stable RL training under sparse rollouts. We show that instability arises from a fundamental policy mismatch among the dense old policy, the sparse sampler policy, and the learner policy. To mitigate this issue, Sparse-RL incorporates Sparsity-Aware Rejection Sampling and Importance-based Reweighting to correct the off-policy bias introduced by compression-induced information loss. Experimental results show that Sparse-RL reduces rollout overhead compared to dense baselines while preserving the performance. Furthermore, Sparse-RL inherently implements sparsity-aware training, significantly enhancing model robustness during sparse inference deployment.</description>

      <title>MATRIX AS PLAN: Structured Logical Reasoning with Feedback-Driven Replanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As knowledge and semantics on the web grow increasingly complex, enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) comprehension and reasoning capabilities has become particularly important. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, it still falls short on logical reasoning tasks that rely on symbolic expressions and strict deductive rules. Neuro-symbolic methods address this gap by enforcing formal correctness through external solvers. Yet these solvers are highly format-sensitive, and small instabilities in model outputs can lead to frequent processing failures. LLM-driven approaches avoid parsing brittleness, but they lack structured representations and process-level error-correction mechanisms. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose MatrixCoT, a structured CoT framework with a matrix-based plan. Specifically, we normalize and type natural language expressions, attach explicit citation fields, and introduce a matrix-based planning method to preserve global relations among steps. The plan becomes a verifiable artifact, making execution more stable. For verification, we also add a feedback-driven replanning mechanism. Under semantic-equivalence constraints, it identifies omissions and defects, rewrites and compresses the dependency matrix, and produces a more trustworthy final answer. Experiments on five logical-reasoning benchmarks and five LLMs show that, without relying on external solvers, MatrixCoT enhances both robustness and interpretability when tackling complex symbolic reasoning tasks, while maintaining competitive performance.</description>

      <title>TopoDIM: One-shot Topology Generation of Diverse Interaction Modes for Multi-Agent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing communication topology in LLM-based multi-agent system is critical for enabling collective intelligence. Existing methods mainly rely on spatio-temporal interaction paradigms, where the sequential execution of multi-round dialogues incurs high latency and computation. Motivated by the recent insights that evaluation and debate mechanisms can improve problem-solving in multi-agent systems, we propose TopoDIM, a framework for one-shot Topology generation with Diverse Interaction Modes. Designed for decentralized execution to enhance adaptability and privacy, TopoDIM enables agents to autonomously construct heterogeneous communication without iterative coordination, achieving token efficiency and improved task performance. Experiments demonstrate that TopoDIM reduces total token consumption by 46.41% while improving average performance by 1.50% over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework exhibits strong adaptability in organizing communication among heterogeneous agents. Code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TopoDIM-8D35/</description>

      <title>ReasAlign: Reasoning Enhanced Safety Alignment against Prompt Injection Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the development of powerful agentic systems capable of automating complex workflows across various fields. However, these systems are highly vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions embedded in external data can hijack agent behavior. In this work, we present ReasAlign, a model-level solution to improve safety alignment against indirect prompt injection attacks. The core idea of ReasAlign is to incorporate structured reasoning steps to analyze user queries, detect conflicting instructions, and preserve the continuity of the user's intended tasks to defend against indirect injection attacks. To further ensure reasoning logic and accuracy, we introduce a test-time scaling mechanism with a preference-optimized judge model that scores reasoning steps and selects the best trajectory. Comprehensive evaluations across various benchmarks show that ReasAlign maintains utility comparable to an undefended model while consistently outperforming Meta SecAlign, the strongest prior guardrail. On the representative open-ended CyberSecEval2 benchmark, which includes multiple prompt-injected tasks, ReasAlign achieves 94.6% utility and only 3.6% ASR, far surpassing the state-of-the-art defensive model of Meta SecAlign (56.4% utility and 74.4% ASR). These results demonstrate that ReasAlign achieves the best trade-off between security and utility, establishing a robust and practical defense against prompt injection attacks in real-world agentic systems.

      <title>PRL: Process Reward Learning Improves LLMs' Reasoning Ability and Broadens the Reasoning Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a continuous topic recently. But most relevant works are based on outcome rewards at the trajectory level, missing fine-grained supervision during the reasoning process. Other existing training frameworks that try to combine process signals together to optimize LLMs also rely heavily on tedious additional steps like MCTS, training a separate reward model, etc., doing harm to the training efficiency. Moreover, the intuition behind the process signals design lacks rigorous theoretical support, leaving the understanding of the optimization mechanism opaque. In this paper, we propose Process Reward Learning (PRL), which decomposes the entropy regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, with rigorous process rewards that could be assigned to models accordingly. Starting from theoretical motivation, we derive the formulation of PRL that is essentially equivalent to the objective of reward maximization plus a KL-divergence penalty term between the policy model and a reference model. However, PRL could turn the outcome reward into process supervision signals, which helps better guide the exploration during RL optimization. From our experiment results, we demonstrate that PRL not only improves the average performance for LLMs' reasoning ability measured by average @ n, but also broadens the reasoning boundary by improving the pass @ n metric. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of PRL could be verified and generalized.</description>

      <title>TRIM: Hybrid Inference via Targeted Stepwise Routing in Multi-Step Reasoning Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-step reasoning tasks like mathematical problem solving are vulnerable to cascading failures, where a single incorrect step leads to complete solution breakdown. Current LLM routing methods assign entire queries to one model, treating all reasoning steps as equal. We propose TRIM (Targeted routing in multi-step reasoning tasks), which routes only critical steps$\unicode{x2013}$those likely to derail the solution$\unicode{x2013}$to larger models while letting smaller models handle routine continuations. Our key insight is that targeted step-level interventions can fundamentally transform inference efficiency by confining expensive calls to precisely those steps where stronger models prevent cascading errors. TRIM operates at the step-level: it uses process reward models to identify erroneous steps and makes routing decisions based on step-level uncertainty and budget constraints. We develop several routing strategies within TRIM, ranging from a simple threshold-based policy to more expressive policies that reason about long-horizon accuracy-cost trade-offs and uncertainty in step-level correctness estimates. On MATH-500, even the simplest thresholding strategy surpasses prior routing methods with 5x higher cost efficiency, while more advanced policies match the strong, expensive model's performance using 80% fewer expensive model tokens. On harder benchmarks such as AIME, TRIM achieves up to 6x higher cost efficiency. All methods generalize effectively across math reasoning tasks, demonstrating that step-level difficulty represents fundamental characteristics of reasoning.</description>

      <title>Evidence-Augmented Policy Optimization with Reward Co-Evolution for Long-Context Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has advanced LLM reasoning, applying it to long-context scenarios is hindered by sparsity of outcome rewards. This limitation fails to penalize ungrounded "lucky guesses," leaving the critical process of needle-in-a-haystack evidence retrieval largely unsupervised. To address this, we propose EAPO (Evidence-Augmented Policy Optimization). We first establish the Evidence-Augmented Reasoning paradigm, validating via Tree-Structured Evidence Sampling that precise evidence extraction is the decisive bottleneck for long-context reasoning. Guided by this insight, EAPO introduces a specialized RL algorithm where a reward model computes a Group-Relative Evidence Reward, providing dense process supervision to explicitly improve evidence quality. To sustain accurate supervision throughout training, we further incorporate an Adaptive Reward-Policy Co-Evolution mechanism. This mechanism iteratively refines the reward model using outcome-consistent rollouts, sharpening its discriminative capability to ensure precise process guidance. Comprehensive evaluations across eight benchmarks demonstrate that EAPO significantly enhances long-context reasoning performance compared to SOTA baselines.</description>

      <title>ROMA: Real-time Omni-Multimodal Assistant with Interactive Streaming Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Omni-multimodal Large Language Models show promise in unified audio, vision, and text modeling. However, streaming audio-video understanding remains challenging, as existing approaches suffer from disjointed capabilities: they typically exhibit incomplete modality support or lack autonomous proactive monitoring. To address this, we present ROMA, a real-time omni-multimodal assistant for unified reactive and proactive interaction. ROMA processes continuous inputs as synchronized multimodal units, aligning dense audio with discrete video frames to handle granularity mismatches. For online decision-making, we introduce a lightweight speak head that decouples response initiation from generation to ensure precise triggering without task conflict. We train ROMA with a curated streaming dataset and a two-stage curriculum that progressively optimizes for streaming format adaptation and proactive responsiveness. To standardize the fragmented evaluation landscape, we reorganize diverse benchmarks into a unified suite covering both proactive (alert, narration) and reactive (QA) settings. Extensive experiments across 12 benchmarks demonstrate ROMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on proactive tasks while competitive in reactive settings, validating its robustness in unified real-time omni-multimodal understanding.</description>

      <title>Agent Skills in the Wild: An Empirical Study of Security Vulnerabilities at Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of AI agent frameworks has introduced agent skills, modular packages containing instructions and executable code that dynamically extend agent capabilities. While this architecture enables powerful customization, skills execute with implicit trust and minimal vetting, creating a significant yet uncharacterized attack surface. We conduct the first large-scale empirical security analysis of this emerging ecosystem, collecting 42,447 skills from two major marketplaces and systematically analyzing 31,132 using SkillScan, a multi-stage detection framework integrating static analysis with LLM-based semantic classification. Our findings reveal pervasive security risks: 26.1% of skills contain at least one vulnerability, spanning 14 distinct patterns across four categories: prompt injection, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, and supply chain risks. Data exfiltration (13.3%) and privilege escalation (11.8%) are most prevalent, while 5.2% of skills exhibit high-severity patterns strongly suggesting malicious intent. We find that skills bundling executable scripts are 2.12x more likely to contain vulnerabilities than instruction-only skills (OR=2.12, p&lt;0.001). Our contributions include: (1) a grounded vulnerability taxonomy derived from 8,126 vulnerable skills, (2) a validated detection methodology achieving 86.7% precision and 82.5% recall, and (3) an open dataset and detection toolkit to support future research. These results demonstrate an urgent need for capability-based permission systems and mandatory security vetting before this attack vector is further exploited.</description>

      <title>SuS: Strategy-aware Surprise for Intrinsic Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Strategy-aware Surprise (SuS), a novel intrinsic motivation framework that uses pre-post prediction mismatch as a novelty signal for exploration in reinforcement learning. Unlike traditional curiosity-driven methods that rely solely on state prediction error, SuS introduces two complementary components: Strategy Stability (SS) and Strategy Surprise (SuS). SS measures consistency in behavioral strategy across temporal steps, while SuS captures unexpected outcomes relative to the agent's current strategy representation. Our combined reward formulation leverages both signals through learned weighting coefficients. We evaluate SuS on mathematical reasoning tasks using large language models, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity. Ablation studies confirm that removing either component results in at least 10% performance degradation, validating the synergistic nature of our approach. SuS achieves 17.4% improvement in Pass@1 and 26.4% improvement in Pass@5 compared to baseline methods, while maintaining higher strategy diversity throughout training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has produced substantial gains in reasoning, perception, and generative capability across language and vision. However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.</description>

      <title>Defending Large Language Models Against Jailbreak Attacks via In-Decoding Safety-Awareness Probing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across natural language tasks and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, recent studies show that such alignment is often shallow and remains vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms, including decoding-based constraints and post-hoc content detectors, struggle against sophisticated jailbreaks, often intervening robust detection or excessively degrading model utility. In this work, we examine the decoding process of LLMs and make a key observation: even when successfully jailbroken, models internally exhibit latent safety-related signals during generation. However, these signals are overridden by the model's drive for fluent continuation, preventing timely self-correction or refusal. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective approach that explicitly surfaces and leverages these latent safety signals for early detection of unsafe content during decoding. Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances safety, while maintaining low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserving response quality. Our results suggest that activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising and complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

      <title>Learning Latency-Aware Orchestration for Parallel Multi-Agent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) enable complex reasoning by coordinating multiple agents, but often incur high inference latency due to multi-step execution and repeated model invocations, severely limiting their scalability and usability in time-sensitive scenarios. Most existing approaches primarily optimize task performance and inference cost, and explicitly or implicitly assume sequential execution, making them less optimal for controlling latency under parallel execution. In this work, we investigate learning-based orchestration of multi-agent systems with explicit latency supervision under parallel execution. We propose Latency-Aware Multi-agent System (LAMaS), a latency-aware multi-agent orchestration framework that enables parallel execution and explicitly optimizes the critical execution path, allowing the controller to construct execution topology graphs with lower latency under parallel execution. Our experiments show that our approach reduces critical path length by 38-46% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline for multi-agent architecture search across multiple benchmarks, while maintaining or even improving task performance.

      <title>Be Your Own Red Teamer: Safety Alignment via Self-Play and Reflective Experience Replay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities but remain vulnerable to adversarial ``jailbreak'' attacks designed to bypass safety guardrails. Current safety alignment methods depend heavily on static external red teaming, utilizing fixed defense prompts or pre-collected adversarial datasets. This leads to a rigid defense that overfits known patterns and fails to generalize to novel, sophisticated threats. To address this critical limitation, we propose empowering the model to be its own red teamer, capable of achieving autonomous and evolving adversarial attacks. Specifically, we introduce Safety Self- Play (SSP), a system that utilizes a single LLM to act concurrently as both the Attacker (generating jailbreaks) and the Defender (refusing harmful requests) within a unified Reinforcement Learning (RL) loop, dynamically evolving attack strategies to uncover vulnerabilities while simultaneously strengthening defense mechanisms. To ensure the Defender effectively addresses critical safety issues during the self-play, we introduce an advanced Reflective Experience Replay Mechanism, which uses an experience pool accumulated throughout the process. The mechanism employs a Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) sampling strategy to focus on failure cases with low rewards, helping the model learn from past hard mistakes while balancing exploration and exploitation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SSP approach autonomously evolves robust defense capabilities, significantly outperforming baselines trained on static adversarial datasets and establishing a new benchmark for proactive safety alignment.</description>

      <title>Fairness Definitions in Language Models Explained</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Despite these advancements, LMs can inherit and amplify societal biases related to sensitive attributes such as gender and race, limiting their adoption in real-world applications. Therefore, fairness has been extensively explored in LMs, leading to the proposal of various fairness notions. However, the lack of clear agreement on which fairness definition to apply in specific contexts and the complexity of understanding the distinctions between these definitions can create confusion and impede further progress. To this end, this paper proposes a systematic survey that clarifies the definitions of fairness as they apply to LMs. Specifically, we begin with a brief introduction to LMs and fairness in LMs, followed by a comprehensive, up-to-date overview of existing fairness notions in LMs and the introduction of a novel taxonomy that categorizes these concepts based on their transformer architecture: encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder LMs. We further illustrate each definition through experiments, showcasing their practical implications and outcomes. Finally, we discuss current research challenges and open questions, aiming to foster innovative ideas and advance the field.

      <title>Exploring the Translation Mechanism of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable success in multilingual translation, their internal core translation mechanisms, even at the fundamental word level, remain insufficiently understood. To address this critical gap, this work introduces a systematic framework for interpreting the mechanism behind LLM translation from the perspective of computational components. This paper first proposes subspace-intervened path patching for precise, fine-grained causal analysis, enabling the detection of components crucial to translation tasks and subsequently characterizing their behavioral patterns in human-interpretable terms. Comprehensive experiments reveal that translation is predominantly driven by a sparse subset of components: specialized attention heads serve critical roles in extracting source language, translation indicators, and positional features, which are then integrated and processed by specific multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) into intermediary English-centric latent representations before ultimately yielding the final translation. The significance of these findings is underscored by the empirical demonstration that targeted fine-tuning a minimal parameter subset ($&lt;5\%$) enhances translation performance while preserving general capabilities. This result further indicates that these crucial components generalize effectively to sentence-level translation and are instrumental in elucidating more intricate translation tasks.</description>

      <title>Text Classification Under Class Distribution Shift: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The basic underlying assumption of machine learning (ML) models is that the training and test data are sampled from the same distribution. However, in daily practice, this assumption is often broken, i.e. the distribution of the test data changes over time, which hinders the application of conventional ML models. One domain where the distribution shift naturally occurs is text classification, since people always find new topics to discuss. To this end, we survey research articles studying open-set text classification and related tasks. We divide the methods in this area based on the constraints that define the kind of distribution shift and the corresponding problem formulation, i.e. learning with the Universum, zero-shot learning, and open-set learning. We next discuss the predominant mitigation approaches for each problem setup. We further identify several future work directions, aiming to push the boundaries beyond the state of the art. Finally, we explain how continual learning can solve many of the issues caused by the shifting class distribution. We maintain a list of relevant papers at https://github.com/Eduard6421/Open-Set-Survey.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Teaching Enables Probabilistic Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as agents that interact with users and with the world. To do so successfully, LLMs must construct representations of the world and form probabilistic beliefs about them. To provide personalized recommendations, for example, the LLM needs to infer a user's preferences from their behavior over multiple interactions. The Bayesian inference framework lays out the optimal way for an agent to update its beliefs as it receives new information. We first show that LLMs fall far short of the standard defined by the Bayesian framework. We then show that by teaching LLMs to mimic the predictions of the normative Bayesian model, we can dramatically improve their ability to update their beliefs; this ability generalizes to new tasks. We conclude that LLMs can effectively learn reasoning skills from examples and generalize those skills to new domains.</description>

      <title>Testing Low-Resource Language Support in LLMs Using Language Proficiency Exams: the Case of Luxembourgish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01667v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an increasingly important tool in research and society at large. While LLMs are regularly used all over the world by experts and lay-people alike, they are predominantly developed with English-speaking users in mind, performing well in English and other wide-spread languages while less-resourced languages such as Luxembourgish are seen as a lower priority. This lack of attention is also reflected in the sparsity of available evaluation tools and datasets. In this study, we investigate the viability of language proficiency exams as such evaluation tools for the Luxembourgish language. We find that large models such as Claude and DeepSeek-R1 typically achieve high scores, while smaller models show weak performances. We also find that the performances in such language exams can be used to predict performances in other NLP tasks in Luxembourgish.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With recent advancements in large language models, web agents have been greatly improved. However, dealing with complex and dynamic web environments requires more advanced planning and search abilities. Previous studies usually adopt a greedy one-way search strategy, which may struggle to recover from erroneous states. In this work, we enhance web agents with an explicit rollback mechanism, enabling the agent to revert back to a previous state in its navigation trajectory. This mechanism gives models the flexibility to directly control the search process, leading to an effective and efficient web navigation method. We conduct experiments on two live web navigation benchmarks with zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>On the Failure of Latent State Persistence in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10571v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning, whether they can sustain persistent latent states remains under-explored. The capacity to maintain and manipulate unexpressed, internal representations-analogous to human working memory-is a cornerstone of complex reasoning. In this paper, we formalize and quantify the "Latent State Persistence" (LSP) gap through three novel experiments. First, we utilize a Number Guessing Game, demonstrating that across independent queries, LLMs fail to allocate probability mass to a singular hidden choice, violating a fundamental probabilistic principle. Second, we employ a Yes-No Game to show that as the number of questions increases, LLMs suffer from "concept drift," leading to inevitable self-contradictions due to the lack of LSP. Finally, inspired by Mathematical Mentalism, we task models with tracking transformations on hidden variables, revealing a failure in variable binding and state evolution when the initial state is not explicitly present in the context. Collectively, these findings suggest that LLMs function as reactive post-hoc solvers rather than proactive planners with LSP. Our work provides a framework for evaluating the fidelity of internal representations and highlights a fundamental architectural divergence between autoregressive transformers and human-like cognition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clinical narratives encode temporal dynamics essential for modeling patient trajectories, yet large-scale temporally annotated resources are scarce. We introduce PMOA-TTS, a corpus of 124,699 single-patient PubMed Open Access case reports converted into structured textual timelines of (event, time) pairs using a scalable large-language-model pipeline (Llama 3.3 70B and DeepSeek-R1). The corpus comprises over 5.6 million timestamped events, alongside extracted demographics and diagnoses. Technical validation uses a clinician-curated gold set and three measures: semantic event matching, temporal concordance (c-index), and alignment error summarized with Area Under the Log-Time CDF (AULTC). We benchmark alternative prompting and model choices and provide documentation to support reproduction. PMOA-TTS enables research on timeline extraction, temporal reasoning, survival modeling and event forecasting from narrative text, and offers broad diagnostic and demographic coverage. Data and code are openly available in public repositories.</description>

      <title>The Open Proof Corpus: A Large-Scale Study of LLM-Generated Mathematical Proofs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent months, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in mathematical proof generation, but further advancement is hindered by the lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset of human-evaluated proofs. While expensive to create, such a dataset is essential for driving improvements in training and enabling a rigorous analysis of proof generation capabilities. In this work, we present the Open Proof Corpus (OPC), a dataset comprising over 5,000 human-evaluated proofs produced by state-of-the-art LLMs. The OPC was specifically designed for broad applicability and downstream usage in proof generation research and is the first to include a substantial number of correct, LLM-generated solutions to problems from prestigious mathematics competitions such as the USAMO and IMO. Using the OPC, we explore critical questions in automated proof generation: (1) the performance gap between natural language and formal proof generation, (2) the discrepancy between final-answer accuracy and full-proof validity, and (3) the impact of best-of-n selection on proof quality. Finally, to showcase the utility of the OPC, we finetune an 8B-parameter model on the dataset, obtaining a model that performs on par with the best model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, on the task of evaluating proof correctness.</description>

      <title>OMHBench: Benchmarking Balanced and Grounded Omni-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have increasingly supported omni-modal processing across text, vision, and speech. However, existing evaluation frameworks for such models suffer from critical limitations, including modality shortcuts and biased reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we propose OMHBench, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate omni-modal multi-hop reasoning. It consists of 6,144 questions with balanced reasoning paths that are jointly grounded across all three modalities. Extensive evaluation of 13 state-of-the-art models reveals that (1) a large performance gap exists between proprietary and open-source MLLMs and (2) even proprietary models exhibit high sensitivity to reasoning path variations, resulting in asymmetric omni-modal grounding. Notably, models struggle when processing the speech modality, underscoring the need for balanced, multi-hop evaluation of omni-modal intelligence.</description>

      <title>How Quantization Shapes Bias in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of how quantization affects model bias, with particular attention to its impact on individual demographic subgroups. We focus on weight and activation quantization strategies and examine their effects across a broad range of bias types, including stereotypes, fairness, toxicity, and sentiment. We employ both probability- and generated text-based metrics across 13 benchmarks and evaluate models that differ in architecture family and reasoning ability. Our findings show that quantization has a nuanced impact on bias: while it can reduce model toxicity and does not significantly impact sentiment, it tends to slightly increase stereotypes and unfairness in generative tasks, especially under aggressive compression. These trends are generally consistent across demographic categories and subgroups, and model types, although their magnitude depends on the specific setting. Overall, our results highlight the importance of carefully balancing efficiency and ethical considerations when applying quantization in practice.</description>

      <title>JudgeAgent: Beyond Static Benchmarks for Knowledge-Driven and Dynamic LLM Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02097v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) primarily rely on static benchmarks, presenting two major challenges: limited knowledge coverage and fixed difficulties that mismatch with the evaluated LLMs. These limitations lead to superficial assessments of LLM knowledge, thereby impeding the targeted model optimizations. To bridge this gap, we propose JudgeAgent, a knowledge-driven and dynamic evaluation framework for LLMs. To address the challenge of limited knowledge coverage, JudgeAgent leverages LLM agents equipped with context graphs to traverse knowledge structures systematically for question generation. Furthermore, to mitigate data contamination and difficulty mismatch, it adopts a difficulty-adaptive and multi-turn interview mechanism. Thereby, JudgeAgent can achieve comprehensive evaluations and facilitate more effective improvement of LLMs. Empirical results demonstrate that JudgeAgent enables more comprehensive evaluations and facilitates effective model iterations, highlighting the potential of this knowledge-driven and dynamic evaluation paradigm.

      <title>Small Open Models Achieve Near Parity with Large Models in Low Resource Literary Translation at a Fraction of the Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Literary translation has recently gained attention as a distinct and complex task in machine translation research. However, the translation by small open models remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing research by introducing TinyFabulist Translation Framework (TF2), a unified framework for dataset creation, fine-tuning, and evaluation in English-&gt;Romanian literary translation, centered on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine-tuned language model (TF2-12B) and large-scale synthetic parallel datasets (DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K). Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the largest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for rich, high-quality literary datasets in low-resource languages such as Romanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high-quality Romanian reference translations from the TF1 pool using a high-performing LLM. We then apply a two-stage fine-tuning process to a 12B-parameter open-weight model: (i) instruction tuning to capture genre-specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for efficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus-level BLEU with a five-dimension LLM-based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, and cultural adaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results show that our fine-tuned model achieves strong fluency and adequacy, narrowing the gap to top-performing proprietary models under automated and human-anchored evaluation, while being open, accessible, and significantly more cost-effective. Alongside the fine-tuned model and both datasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost-efficient translation, cross-lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open models for culturally significant literary content in low-resource settings.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) utilize key-value (KV) cache to store historical information during sequence processing. The size of KV cache grows linearly as the length of the sequence extends, which seriously affects memory usage and decoding efficiency. Current methods for KV cache eviction typically utilize the last window from the pre-filling phase as queries to compute the KV importance scores for eviction. Although this scheme is simple to implement, it tends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect or omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose Judge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This method only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By concatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train these tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that of the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the soft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the importance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining decoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our method exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction approaches. We validate our approach through experiments conducted on models such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, using benchmarks including LongBench, RULER, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Results indicate an improvement of approximately 1 point on the LongBench and over 3 points on RULER. This proposed methodology can be seamlessly integrated into existing open-source models with minimal training overhead, thereby enhancing performance in KV cache eviction scenarios.</description>

      <title>Filling in the Clinical Gaps in Benchmark: Case for HealthBench for the Japanese medical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the applicability of HealthBench, a large-scale, rubric-based medical benchmark, to the Japanese context. Although robust evaluation frameworks are essential for the safe development of medical LLMs, resources in Japanese are scarce and often consist of translated multiple-choice questions. Our research addresses this issue in two ways. First, we establish a performance baseline by applying a machine-translated version of HealthBench's 5,000 scenarios to evaluate two models: a high-performing multilingual model (GPT-4.1) and a Japanese-native open-source model (LLM-jp-3.1). Secondly, we use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach to systematically classify the benchmark's scenarios and rubric criteria. This allows us to identify 'contextual gaps' where the content is misaligned with Japan's clinical guidelines, healthcare systems or cultural norms. Our findings reveal a modest performance drop in GPT-4.1 due to rubric mismatches, as well as a significant failure in the Japanese-native model, which lacked the required clinical completeness. Furthermore, our classification shows that, despite most scenarios being applicable, a significant proportion of the rubric criteria require localisation. This work underscores the limitations of direct benchmark translation and highlights the urgent need for a context-aware, localised adaptation, a "J-HealthBench", to ensure the reliable and safe evaluation of medical LLMs in Japan.</description>

      <title>Textual Entailment is not a Better Bias Metric than Token Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement of social bias in language models is typically by token probability (TP) metrics, which are broadly applicable but have been criticized for their distance from real-world language model use cases and harms. In this work, we test natural language inference (NLI) as an alternative bias metric. In extensive experiments across seven LM families, we show that NLI and TP bias evaluation behave substantially differently, with very low correlation among different NLI metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. NLI metrics are more brittle and unstable, slightly less sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences, and slightly more sensitive to wording of tested stereotypes than TP approaches. Given this conflicting evidence, we conclude that neither token probability nor natural language inference is a ``better'' bias metric in all cases. We do not find sufficient evidence to justify NLI as a complete replacement for TP metrics in bias evaluation.</description>

      <title>Parallel Test-Time Scaling for Latent Reasoning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for advanced trajectory aggregation. This work enables parallel TTS for latent reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM) trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection. Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in continuous spaces. Code and checkpoints released at https://github.com/ModalityDance/LatentTTS</description>

      <title>One Sentence, Two Embeddings: Contrastive Learning of Explicit and Implicit Semantic Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sentence embedding methods have made remarkable progress, yet they still struggle to capture the implicit semantics within sentences. This can be attributed to the inherent limitations of conventional sentence embedding methods that assign only a single vector per sentence. To overcome this limitation, we propose DualCSE, a sentence embedding method that assigns two embeddings to each sentence: one representing the explicit semantics and the other representing the implicit semantics. These embeddings coexist in the shared space, enabling the selection of the desired semantics for specific purposes such as information retrieval and text classification. Experimental results demonstrate that DualCSE can effectively encode both explicit and implicit meanings and improve the performance of the downstream task.</description>

      <title>Classifying and Addressing the Diversity of Errors in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for building LLM-based question-answering systems that can take advantage of external knowledge databases. Due to the complexity of real-world RAG systems, there are many potential causes for erroneous outputs. Understanding the range of errors that can occur in practice is crucial for robust deployment. We present a new taxonomy of the error types that can occur in realistic RAG systems, examples of each, and practical advice for addressing them. Additionally, we curate a dataset of erroneous RAG responses annotated by error types. We then propose an auto-evaluation method aligned with our taxonomy that can be used in practice to track and address errors during development. Code and data are available at https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/rag-error-classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study is the first to investigate LLM comprehension capabilities over long-context (LC), clinically relevant medical Question Answering (QA) beyond MCQA. Our comprehensive approach considers a range of settings based on content inclusion of varying size and relevance, LLM models of different capabilities and a variety of datasets across task formulations. We reveal insights on model size effects and their limitations, underlying memorization issues and the benefits of reasoning models, while demonstrating the value and challenges of leveraging the full long patient's context. Importantly, we examine the effect of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) on medical LC comprehension, showcasing best settings in single versus multi-document QA datasets. We shed light into some of the evaluation aspects using a multi-faceted approach uncovering common metric challenges. Our quantitative analysis reveals challenging cases where RAG excels while still showing limitations in cases requiring temporal reasoning.</description>

      <title>CoSense-LLM: Semantics at the Edge with Cost- and Uncertainty-Aware Cloud-Edge Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19670v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present CoSense-LLM, an edge-first framework that turns continuous multimodal sensor streams (for example Wi-Fi CSI, IMU, audio, RFID, and lightweight vision) into compact, verifiable semantic tokens and coordinates with large language models under explicit latency, energy, bandwidth, and privacy constraints. CoSense-LLM has four parts: (i) SenseFusion, a lightweight encoder that aligns sensor embeddings with language and compresses them into short discrete code sequences; (ii) Edge-RAG, a local hybrid retrieval layer that grounds generation in site specific policies and notes; (iii) PromptRouter, a cost and uncertainty aware policy that selects edge only generation, edge plus retrieval, or compact cloud escalation; and (iv) Secure Execution, an auditable redaction path that enforces data minimization so raw waveforms never leave the device. The system works with modern serving optimizations, including paged or streaming KV caches, FlashAttention style kernels, speculative decoding, and quantized LoRA adapters, and supports on device personalization and federated updates under non IID drift. Across home, office, and clinic deployments, CoSense-LLM delivers grounded explanations while meeting tight service level objectives: it sustains sub second (p95) end to end latency on edge dominant paths, reduces inter tier token and bandwidth costs by preferring local retrieval grounded responses, and preserves privacy by transmitting only discrete codes and redacted metadata. Ablations show that Edge-RAG improves factual consistency and reduces contradictions, calibrated uncertainty enables selective abstention and controlled escalations, and KV plus decoding accelerators lower energy per decision. The results support an edge first design that treats semantics, privacy, and predictable latency as co equal goals for large model deployments in interference prone environments.</description>

      <title>User Perceptions vs. Proxy LLM Judges: Privacy and Helpfulness in LLM Responses to Privacy-Sensitive Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted for tasks like drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In these settings, users may need to share private information (e.g., contact details, health records). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such information, prior work introduced real-life, scenario-based benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) and found that LLMs can leak private information in complex scenarios. However, these evaluations relied on proxy LLMs to judge the helpfulness and privacy-preservation quality of LLM responses, rather than directly measuring users' perceptions. To understand how users perceive the helpfulness and privacy-preservation quality of LLM responses to privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study ($n=94$) using 90 PrivacyLens scenarios. We found that users had low agreement with each other when evaluating identical LLM responses. In contrast, five proxy LLMs reached high agreement, yet each proxy LLM had low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that proxy LLMs cannot accurately estimate users' wide range of perceptions of utility and privacy in privacy-sensitive scenarios. We discuss the need for more user-centered studies to measure LLMs' ability to help users while preserving privacy, and for improving alignment between LLMs and users in estimating perceived privacy and utility.</description>

      <title>Relative Scaling Laws for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling laws describe how language models improve with additional data, parameters, and compute. While widely used, they are typically measured on aggregate test sets. Aggregate evaluations yield clean trends but average over heterogeneous subpopulations, obscuring performance disparities. We introduce relative scaling laws, which track how performance gaps between test distributions evolve with scale rather than focusing solely on absolute error. Using 255 decoder-only Transformers trained under matched-compute (IsoFLOP) budgets from $10^{18}$--$10^{20}$ FLOPs on standard pretraining datasets, we find diverse trajectories: academic domains on MMLU converge toward parity; regional English dialects shift depending on population size; and clusters of AI risk behaviours split, with capability- and influence-related risks increasing during pretraining while adversarial risks do not. These results show that although scaling improves overall performance, it is not a universal equalizer. To support further study, we release all model checkpoints from this work to enable practitioners to measure relative alongside traditional scaling laws, in order to better prioritize robustness challenges in light of the bitter lesson.</description>

      <title>Are Language Models Efficient Reasoners? A Perspective from Logic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities, yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect of reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming, introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through irrelevant inferences.</description>

      <title>PlotCraft: Pushing the Limits of LLMs for Complex and Interactive Data Visualization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in code generation. However, their ability to create complex visualizations for scaled and structured data remains largely unevaluated and underdeveloped. To address this gap, we introduce PlotCraft, a new benchmark featuring 1k challenging visualization tasks that cover a wide range of topics, such as finance, scientific research, and sociology. The benchmark is structured around seven high-level visualization tasks and encompasses 48 distinct chart types. Crucially, it is the first to systematically evaluate both single-turn generation and multi-turn refinement across a diverse spectrum of task complexities. Our comprehensive evaluation of 23 leading LLMs on PlotCraft reveals obvious performance deficiencies in handling sophisticated visualization tasks. To bridge this performance gap, we develope SynthVis-30K, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of complex visualization code synthesized via a collaborative agent framework. Building upon this dataset, we develope PlotCraftor, a novel code generation model that achieves strong capabilities in complex data visualization with a remarkably small size. Across VisEval, PandasPlotBench, and our proposed PlotCraft, PlotCraftor shows performance comparable to that of leading proprietary approaches. Especially, on hard task, Our model achieves over 50% performance improvement. We will release the benchmark, dataset, and code at https://github.com/Speakn0w/PlotCraft-Benchmark.</description>

      <title>Multi-Personality Generation of LLMs at Decoding-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01891v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-personality generation for LLMs, enabling simultaneous embodiment of multiple personalization attributes, is a fundamental challenge. Existing retraining-based approaches are costly and poorly scalable, while decoding-time methods often rely on external models or heuristics, limiting flexibility and robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Personality Generation (MPG) framework under the decoding-time combination paradigm. It flexibly controls multi-personality without relying on scarce multi-dimensional models or extra training, leveraging implicit density ratios in single-dimensional models as a "free lunch" to reformulate the task as sampling from a target strategy aggregating these ratios. To implement MPG efficiently, we design Speculative Chunk-level based Rejection sampling (SCR), which generates responses in chunks and parallelly validates them via estimated thresholds within a sliding window. This significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining high-quality generation. Experiments on MBTI personality and Role-Playing demonstrate the effectiveness of MPG, showing improvements up to 16%-18%.

      <title>GraphIF: Enhancing Multi-Turn Instruction Following for Large Language Models with Relation Graph Prompt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-turn instruction following is essential for building intelligent conversational systems that can consistently adhere to instructions across dialogue turns. However, existing approaches to enhancing multi-turn instruction following primarily rely on collecting or generating large-scale multi-turn dialogue datasets to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), which treat each response generation as an isolated task and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into the optimization objectives. As a result, instruction-tuned LLMs often struggle with complex long-distance constraints. In multi-turn dialogues, relational constraints across turns can be naturally modeled as labeled directed edges, making graph structures particularly suitable for modeling multi-turn instruction following. Despite this potential, leveraging graph structures to enhance the multi-turn instruction following capabilities of LLMs remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose GraphIF, a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and leverages graph prompts to enhance the instruction following capabilities of LLMs. GraphIF comprises three key components: (1) an agent-based relation extraction module that captures inter-turn semantic relations via action-triggered mechanisms to construct structured graphs; (2) a relation graph prompt generation module that converts structured graph information into natural language prompts; and (3) a response rewriting module that refines initial LLM outputs using the generated graph prompts. Extensive experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that GraphIF can be seamlessly integrated into instruction-tuned LLMs and leads to significant improvements across all four multi-turn instruction-following evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Mistake Notebook Learning: Batch-Clustered Failures for Training-Free Agent Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in persistent, real-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks and inevitable failures. A key limitation, however, is their inability to systematically learn from these mistakes, forcing them to repeat identical errors in similar contexts. Unlike prior training-free methods that primarily store raw instance-level experience or focus on retrieving successful trajectories, we propose Mistake Notebook Learning (MNL), a novel memory framework that enables agents to self-curate generalizable guidance from batch-clustered failures. This mechanism allows agents to distill shared error patterns into structured ``mistake notes,'' updating an external memory only when batch performance improves to ensure stability. To further amplify adaptability, we integrate MNL with test-time scaling, leveraging aggregated failure patterns to actively steer the search process away from known pitfalls. Experiments on mathematical reasoning, Text-to-SQL, and interactive agent benchmarks show that MNL achieves competitive performance compared to existing memory mechanisms and in-context methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. These findings position structured mistake abstraction as a critical lever for robust agent evolution, enabling continuous improvement without the cost of parameter updates.</description>

      <title>AWPO: Enhancing Tool-Use of Large Language Models through Adaptive Integration of Reasoning Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) shows promise in training tool-use Large Language Models (LLMs) using verifiable outcome rewards, existing methods largely overlook the potential of reasoning rewards based on chain-of-thought quality for better tool utilization. Furthermore, na\"ively combining reasoning and outcome rewards may yield suboptimal performance or conflict with the primary optimization objective. To address this, we propose Advantage-Weighted Policy Optimization (AWPO), a principled RL framework that adaptively integrates reasoning rewards into advantage estimation to improve tool-use performance. AWPO incorporates variance-aware gating and difficulty-aware weighting to adaptively modulate advantages from reasoning signals based on group-relative statistics, alongside a tailored clipping mechanism for stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AWPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard tool-use benchmarks, significantly outperforming strong baselines and leading closed-source models in challenging multi-turn scenarios. Notably, with exceptional parameter efficiency, our 4B model surpasses Grok-4 by $16.0\%$ in multi-turn accuracy while preserving generalization capability on the out-of-distribution MMLU-Pro benchmark.</description>

      <title>Five Years of SciCap: What We Learned and Future Directions for Scientific Figure Captioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Between 2021 and 2025, the SciCap project grew from a small seed-funded idea at The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) into one of the central efforts shaping the scientific figure-captioning landscape. Supported by a Penn State seed grant, Adobe, and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, what began as our attempt to test whether domain-specific training, which was successful in text models like SciBERT, could also work for figure captions expanded into a multi-institution collaboration. Over these five years, we curated, released, and continually updated a large collection of figure-caption pairs from arXiv papers, conducted extensive automatic and human evaluations on both generated and author-written captions, navigated the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs), launched annual challenges, and built interactive systems that help scientists write better captions. In this piece, we look back at the first five years of SciCap and summarize the key technical and methodological lessons we learned. We then outline five major unsolved challenges and propose directions for the next phase of research in scientific figure captioning.</description>

      <title>Beg to Differ: Understanding Reasoning-Answer Misalignment Across Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities through chain-of-thought prompting, but whether this reasoning quality transfers across languages remains underexplored. We introduce a human-validated framework to evaluate whether model-generated reasoning traces logically support their conclusions across languages. Analyzing 65k reasoning traces from GlobalMMLU questions across 6 languages and 6 frontier models, we uncover a critical blind spot: while models achieve high task accuracy, their reasoning can fail to support their conclusions. Reasoning traces in non-Latin scripts show at least twice as much misalignment between their reasoning and conclusions than those in Latin scripts. We develop an error taxonomy through human annotation to characterize these failures, finding they stem primarily from evidential errors (unsupported claims, ambiguous facts) followed by illogical reasoning steps. Our findings demonstrate that current multilingual evaluation practices provide an incomplete picture of model reasoning capabilities and highlight the need for reasoning-aware evaluation frameworks.</description>

      <title>Bridging the gap: A comparative exploration of Speech-LLM and end-to-end architecture for multilingual conversational ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The INTERSPEECH 2025 Challenge on Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Models (MLC-SLM) promotes multilingual conversational ASR with large language models (LLMs). Our previous SHNU-mASR system adopted a competitive parallel-speech-encoder architecture that integrated Whisper and mHuBERT with an LLM. However, it faced two challenges: simple feature concatenation may not fully exploit complementary information, and the performance gap between LLM-based ASR and end-to-end(E2E) encoder-decoder ASR remained unexplored. In this work, we present an enhanced LLM-based ASR framework that combines fine-tuned Whisper and mHuBERT encoders with an LLM to enrich speech representations. We first evaluate E2E Whisper models with LoRA and full fine-tuning on the MLC-SLM ASR task, and then propose cross-attention-based fusion mechanisms for the parallel-speech-encoder. On the official evaluation set of the MLC-SLM Challenge, our system achieves a CER/WER of 10.69%, ranking on par with the top-ranked Track 1 systems, even though it uses only 1,500 hours of baseline training data compared with their large-scale training sets. Nonetheless, we find that our final LLM-based ASR still does not match the performance of a fine-tuned E2E Whisper model, providing valuable empirical guidance for future Speech-LLM design. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/1535176727/MLC-SLM.</description>

      <title>Lil: Less is Less When Applying Post-Training Sparse-Attention Algorithms in Long-Decode Stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities across a wide range of complex tasks and are increasingly deployed at scale, placing significant demands on inference efficiency. Prior work typically decomposes inference into prefill and decode stages, with the decode stage dominating total latency. To reduce time and memory complexity in the decode stage, a line of work introduces sparse-attention algorithms. In this paper, we show, both empirically and theoretically, that sparse attention can paradoxically increase end-to-end complexity: information loss often induces significantly longer sequences, a phenomenon we term ``Less is Less'' (Lil). To mitigate the Lil problem, we propose an early-stopping algorithm that detects the threshold where information loss exceeds information gain during sparse decoding. Our early-stopping algorithm reduces token consumption by up to 90% with a marginal accuracy degradation of less than 2% across reasoning-intensive benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Disco-RAG: Discourse-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an important means of enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, most existing RAG strategies treat retrieved passages in a flat and unstructured way, which prevents the model from capturing structural cues and constrains its ability to synthesize knowledge from dispersed evidence across documents. To overcome these limitations, we propose Disco-RAG, a discourse-aware framework that explicitly injects discourse signals into the generation process. Our method constructs intra-chunk discourse trees to capture local hierarchies and builds inter-chunk rhetorical graphs to model cross-passage coherence. These structures are jointly integrated into a planning blueprint that conditions the generation. Experiments on question answering and long-document summarization benchmarks show the efficacy of our approach. Disco-RAG achieves state-of-the-art results on the benchmarks without fine-tuning. These findings underscore the important role of discourse structure in advancing RAG systems.</description>

      <title>TeleMem: Building Long-Term and Multimodal Memory for Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many NLP tasks but struggle to sustain long-term interactions due to limited attention over extended dialogue histories. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue but lacks reliable mechanisms for updating or refining stored memories, leading to schema-driven hallucinations, inefficient write operations, and minimal support for multimodal reasoning.To address these challenges, we propose TeleMem, a unified long-term and multimodal memory system that maintains coherent user profiles through narrative dynamic extraction, ensuring that only dialogue-grounded information is preserved. TeleMem further introduces a structured writing pipeline that batches, retrieves, clusters, and consolidates memory entries, substantially improving storage efficiency, reducing token usage, and accelerating memory operations. Additionally, a multimodal memory module combined with ReAct-style reasoning equips the system with a closed-loop observe, think, and act process that enables accurate understanding of complex video content in long-term contexts. Experimental results show that TeleMem surpasses the state-of-the-art Mem0 baseline with 19% higher accuracy, 43% fewer tokens, and a 2.1x speedup on the ZH-4O long-term role-play gaming benchmark.</description>

      <title>Controlled Self-Evolution for Algorithmic Code Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07348v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-evolution methods enhance code generation through iterative "generate-verify-refine" cycles, yet existing approaches suffer from low exploration efficiency, failing to discover solutions with superior complexity within limited budgets. This inefficiency stems from initialization bias trapping evolution in poor solution regions, uncontrolled stochastic operations lacking feedback guidance, and insufficient experience utilization across tasks. To address these bottlenecks, we propose Controlled Self-Evolution (CSE), which consists of three key components. Diversified Planning Initialization generates structurally distinct algorithmic strategies for broad solution space coverage. Genetic Evolution replaces stochastic operations with feedback-guided mechanisms, enabling targeted mutation and compositional crossover. Hierarchical Evolution Memory captures both successful and failed experiences at inter-task and intra-task levels. Experiments on EffiBench-X demonstrate that CSE consistently outperforms all baselines across various LLM backbones. Furthermore, CSE achieves higher efficiency from early generations and maintains continuous improvement throughout evolution.

      <title>Scalable and Reliable Evaluation of AI Knowledge Retrieval Systems: RIKER and the Coherent Simulated Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating knowledge systems (LLMs, RAG, knowledge graphs, etc) faces fundamental challenges: static benchmarks are vulnerable to contamination, LLM-based judges exhibit systematic biases, and ground truth extraction requires expensive human annotation. We present RIKER (Retrieval Intelligence and Knowledge Extraction Rating), both a benchmark and a replicable methodology based on paradigm inversion - generating documents from known ground truth rather than extracting ground truth from documents. This approach enables deterministic scoring and scalable evaluation without human annotation or reference models, and contamination resistance through regenerable corpora. Our evaluation of 33 models using over 21 billion tokens reveals that context length claims frequently exceed usable capacity, with significant degradation beyond 32K tokens; cross-document aggregation proves substantially harder than single-document extraction; and grounding ability and hallucination resistance are distinct capabilities - models excelling at finding facts that exist may still fabricate facts that do not. Beyond the specific benchmark, we contribute a domain-agnostic methodology for constructing scalable and contamination-resistant evaluations wherever synthetic documents can be generated from structured ground truth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present TranslateGemma, a suite of open machine translation models based on the Gemma 3 foundation models. To enhance the inherent multilingual capabilities of Gemma 3 for the translation task, we employ a two-stage fine-tuning process. First, supervised fine-tuning is performed using a rich mixture of high-quality large-scale synthetic parallel data generated via state-of-the-art models and human-translated parallel data. This is followed by a reinforcement learning phase, where we optimize translation quality using an ensemble of reward models, including MetricX-QE and AutoMQM, targeting translation quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TranslateGemma with human evaluation on the WMT25 test set across 10 language pairs and with automatic evaluation on the WMT24++ benchmark across 55 language pairs. Automatic metrics show consistent and substantial gains over the baseline Gemma 3 models across all sizes. Notably, smaller TranslateGemma models often achieve performance comparable to larger baseline models, offering improved efficiency. We also show that TranslateGemma models retain strong multimodal capabilities, with enhanced performance on the Vistra image translation benchmark. The release of the open TranslateGemma models aims to provide the research community with powerful and adaptable tools for machine translation.</description>

      <title>How Many Human Judgments Are Enough? Feasibility Limits of Human Preference Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human preference evaluations are widely used to compare generative models, yet it remains unclear how many judgments are required to reliably detect small improvements. We show that when preference signal is diffuse across prompts (i.e., all prompt types are similarly informative), proportional allocation is minimax-optimal: no allocation strategy substantially improves detectability. Empirical analysis of large-scale human preference datasets shows that most comparisons fall into this diffuse regime, exhibiting small preference margins that require far more judgments than typically collected, even in well-sampled comparisons. These limits persist across evaluation protocols and modalities, including chat, image generation, and code generation with execution feedback. In contrast, curated benchmarks that reduce prompt induced variability systematically induce larger margins and improve detectability through a $1.5\times$ reduction in prompt-level variance. Our results show that inconclusive or negative human evaluation outcomes frequently reflect underpowered evaluation rather than model equivalence, underscoring the need to account explicitly for effect size, budget, and protocol design.</description>

Abstract: We introduce A.X K1, a 519B-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model trained from scratch. Our design leverages scaling laws to optimize training configurations and vocabulary size under fixed computational budgets. A.X K1 is pre-trained on a corpus of approximately 10T tokens, curated by a multi-stage data processing pipeline. Designed to bridge the gap between reasoning capability and inference efficiency, A.X K1 supports explicitly controllable reasoning to facilitate scalable deployment across diverse real-world scenarios. We propose a simple yet effective Think-Fusion training recipe, enabling user-controlled switching between thinking and non-thinking modes within a single unified model. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that A.X K1 achieves performance competitive with leading open-source models, while establishing a distinctive advantage in Korean-language benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Bias Dynamics in BabyLMs: Towards a Compute-Efficient Sandbox for Democratising Pre-Training Debiasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pre-trained language models (LMs) have, over the last few years, grown substantially in both societal adoption and training costs. This rapid growth in size has constrained progress in understanding and mitigating their biases. Since re-training LMs is prohibitively expensive, most debiasing work has focused on post-hoc or masking-based strategies, which often fail to address the underlying causes of bias. In this work, we seek to democratise pre-model debiasing research by using low-cost proxy models. Specifically, we investigate BabyLMs, compact BERT-like models trained on small and mutable corpora that can approximate bias acquisition and learning dynamics of larger models. We show that BabyLMs display closely aligned patterns of intrinsic bias formation and performance development compared to standard BERT models, despite their drastically reduced size. Furthermore, correlations between BabyLMs and BERT hold across multiple intra-model and post-model debiasing methods. Leveraging these similarities, we conduct pre-model debiasing experiments with BabyLMs, replicating prior findings and presenting new insights regarding the influence of gender imbalance and toxicity on bias formation. Our results demonstrate that BabyLMs can serve as an effective sandbox for large-scale LMs, reducing pre-training costs from over 500 GPU-hours to under 30 GPU-hours. This provides a way to democratise pre-model debiasing research and enables faster, more accessible exploration of methods for building fairer LMs.</description>

      <title>CoMAT: Chain of Mathematically Annotated Thought Improves Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), despite progress in prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT). We present **Chain of Mathematically Annotated Thought (CoMAT)**, which enhances reasoning through two stages: *Symbolic Conversion* (converting natural language queries into symbolic form) and *Reasoning Execution* (deriving answers from symbolic representations). CoMAT operates entirely with a single LLM and without external solvers. Across four LLMs, CoMAT outperforms traditional CoT on six out of seven benchmarks, achieving gains of 4.48% on MMLU-Redux (MATH) and 4.58% on GaoKao MCQ. In addition to improved performance, CoMAT ensures faithfulness and verifiability, offering a transparent reasoning process for complex mathematical tasks</description>

      <title>Scalable Oversight for Superhuman AI via Recursive Self-Critiquing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04675v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI capabilities increasingly surpass human proficiency in complex tasks, current alignment techniques, including SFT and RLHF, face fundamental challenges in ensuring reliable oversight. These methods rely on direct human assessment and become impractical when AI outputs exceed human cognitive thresholds. In response to this challenge, we explore two hypotheses: (1) \textit{Critique of critique can be easier than critique itself}, extending the widely-accepted observation that verification is easier than generation to the critique domain, as critique itself is a specialized form of generation; (2) \textit{This difficulty relationship holds recursively}, suggesting that when direct evaluation is infeasible, performing higher-order critiques (e.g., critique of critique of critique) offers a more tractable supervision pathway. We conduct Human-Human, Human-AI, and AI-AI experiments to investigate the potential of recursive self-critiquing for AI supervision. Our results highlight recursive critique as a promising approach for scalable AI oversight.</description>

      <title>MathArena: Evaluating LLMs on Uncontaminated Math Competitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) has led to notable improvements on mathematical benchmarks. However, many of the most commonly used evaluation datasets (e.g., AIME 2024) are widely available online, making it difficult to disentangle genuine reasoning from potential memorization. Furthermore, these benchmarks do not evaluate proof-writing capabilities, which are crucial for many mathematical tasks. To address this, we introduce MathArena, a new benchmark based on the following key insight: recurring math competitions provide a stream of high-quality, challenging problems that can be used for real-time evaluation of LLMs. By evaluating models as soon as new problems are released, we effectively eliminate the risk of contamination. Using this framework, we find strong signs of contamination in AIME 2024. Nonetheless, evaluations on harder competitions, such as CMIMC 2025, demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities in top-performing models. MathArena is also the first benchmark for proof-writing capabilities. On IMO 2025, top models achieve slightly less than 40%, demonstrating both notable progress and significant room for improvement. So far, we have evaluated over $50$ models across seven competitions, totaling $162$ problems. As an evolving benchmark, MathArena will continue to track the progress of LLMs on newly released competitions, ensuring rigorous and up-to-date evaluation of mathematical reasoning.</description>

      <title>LittleBit: Ultra Low-Bit Quantization via Latent Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13771v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) often faces challenges from substantial memory and computational costs. Quantization offers a solution, yet performance degradation in the sub-1-bit regime remains particularly difficult. This paper introduces LittleBit, a novel method for extreme LLM compression. It targets levels like 0.1 bits per weight (BPW), achieving nearly 31$\times$ memory reduction, e.g., Llama2-13B to under 0.9 GB. LittleBit represents weights in a low-rank form using latent matrix factorization, subsequently binarizing these factors. To counteract information loss from this extreme precision, it integrates a multi-scale compensation mechanism. This includes row, column, and an additional latent dimension that learns per-rank importance. Two key contributions enable effective training: Dual Sign-Value-Independent Decomposition (Dual-SVID) for quantization-aware training (QAT) initialization, and integrated Residual Compensation to mitigate errors. Extensive experiments confirm LittleBit's superiority in sub-1-bit quantization: e.g., its 0.1 BPW performance on Llama2-7B surpasses the leading method's 0.7 BPW. LittleBit establishes a new, viable size-performance trade-off--unlocking a potential 11.6$\times$ speedup over FP16 at the kernel level--and makes powerful LLMs practical for resource-constrained environments. Our code can be found at https://github.com/SamsungLabs/LittleBit.</description>

      <title>COALA: Numerically Stable and Efficient Framework for Context-Aware Low-Rank Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case. Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.</description>

      <title>BASIL: Bayesian Assessment of Sycophancy in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sycophancy (overly agreeable or flattering behavior) poses a fundamental challenge for human-AI collaboration, particularly in high-stakes decision-making domains such as health, law, and education. A central difficulty in studying sycophancy in large language models (LLMs) is disentangling sycophantic belief shifts from rational changes in behavior driven by new evidence or user-provided information. Existing approaches either measure descriptive behavior changes or apply normative evaluations that rely on objective ground truth, limiting their applicability to subjective or uncertain tasks. We introduce a Bayesian probabilistic framework, grounded in behavioral economics and rational decision theory, that explicitly separates sycophancy from rational belief updating. Within this framework, we achieve three objectives: (i) a descriptive metric that measures sycophancy while controlling for rational responses to evidence; (ii) a normative metric that quantifies how sycophancy leads models astray from Bayesian-consistent belief updating; and (iii) the ability to apply both metrics in settings without ground-truth labels. Applying our framework across multiple LLMs and three uncertainty-driven tasks, we find robust evidence of sycophantic belief shifts and show that their impact on rationality depends on whether models systematically over- or under-update their beliefs. Finally, we demonstrate that a post-hoc calibration method and two fine-tuning strategies (SFT and DPO) substantially reduce Bayesian inconsistency, with particularly strong improvements under explicit sycophancy prompting.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Homophily in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets, thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in reasoning-intensive question answering.</description>

      <title>Dual-Uncertainty Guided Policy Learning for Multimodal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language models. However, existing methods typically treat visual inputs as deterministic, overlooking the perceptual ambiguity inherent to the visual modality. Consequently, they fail to distinguish whether a model's uncertainty stems from complex reasoning or ambiguous perception, preventing the targeted allocation of exploration or learning signals. To address this gap, we introduce DUPL, a dual-uncertainty guided policy learning approach for multimodal RLVR that quantifies and leverages both perceptual uncertainty (via symmetric KL divergence) and output uncertainty (via policy entropy) to guide policy updates. By establishing an uncertainty-driven feedback loop and employing a dynamic branch prioritization mechanism, DUPL recalibrates the policy advantage to focus learning on states with high perceptual or decisional ambiguity, enabling effective targeted exploration beyond passive data augmentation. Implemented on top of GRPO and evaluated on six multimodal mathematical and general-domain reasoning benchmarks, DUPL improves Qwen2.5-VL 3B and 7B models, achieving accuracy gains of up to 11.2% on visual math tasks and up to 7.1% on general-domain reasoning tasks, while consistently outperforming GRPO. These results demonstrate that dual-uncertainty guided policy learning is an effective and generalizable approach for multimodal RLVR.</description>

      <title>VAL-Bench: Belief Consistency as a measure for Value Alignment in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used for tasks where outputs shape human decisions, so it is critical to verify that their responses consistently reflect desired human values. Humans, as individuals or groups, don't agree on a universal set of values, which makes evaluating value alignment difficult. Existing benchmarks often use hypothetical or commonsensical situations, which don't capture the complexity and ambiguity of real-life debates. We introduce the Value ALignment Benchmark (VAL-Bench), which measures the consistency in language model belief expressions in response to real-life value-laden prompts. VAL-Bench consists of 115K pairs of prompts designed to elicit opposing stances on a controversial issue, extracted from Wikipedia. We use an LLM-as-a-judge, validated against human annotations, to evaluate if the pair of responses consistently expresses either a neutral or a specific stance on the issue. Applied across leading open- and closed-source models, the benchmark shows considerable variation in consistency rates (ranging from ~10% to ~80%), with Claude models the only ones to achieve high levels of consistency. Lack of consistency in this manner risks epistemic harm by making user beliefs dependent on how questions are framed rather than on underlying evidence, and undermines LLM reliability in trust-critical applications. Therefore, we stress the importance of research towards training belief consistency in modern LLMs. By providing a scalable, reproducible benchmark, VAL-Bench enables systematic measurement of necessary conditions for value alignment.</description>

      <title>ZK-SenseLM: Verifiable Large-Model Wireless Sensing with Selective Abstention and Zero-Knowledge Attestation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ZK-SenseLM is a secure and auditable wireless sensing framework that pairs a large-model encoder for Wi-Fi channel state information (and optionally mmWave radar or RFID) with a policy-grounded decision layer and end-to-end zero-knowledge proofs of inference. The encoder uses masked spectral pretraining with phase-consistency regularization, plus a light cross-modal alignment that ties RF features to compact, human-interpretable policy tokens. To reduce unsafe actions under distribution shift, we add a calibrated selective-abstention head; the chosen risk-coverage operating point is registered and bound into the proof. We implement a four-stage proving pipeline: (C1) feature sanity and commitment, (C2) threshold and version binding, (C3) time-window binding, and (C4) PLONK-style proofs that the quantized network, given the committed window, produced the logged action and confidence. Micro-batched proving amortizes cost across adjacent windows, and a gateway option offloads proofs from low-power devices. The system integrates with differentially private federated learning and on-device personalization without weakening verifiability: model hashes and the registered threshold are part of each public statement. Across activity, presence or intrusion, respiratory proxy, and RF fingerprinting tasks, ZK-SenseLM improves macro-F1 and calibration, yields favorable coverage-risk curves under perturbations, and rejects tamper and replay with compact proofs and fast verification.</description>

      <title>Generative Adversarial Gumbel MCTS for Abstract Visual Composition Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study abstract visual composition, in which identity is primarily determined by the spatial configuration and relations among a small set of geometric primitives (e.g., parts, symmetry, topology). They are invariant primarily to texture and photorealistic detail. Composing such structures from fixed components under geometric constraints and vague goal specification (such as text) is non-trivial due to combinatorial placement choices, limited data, and discrete feasibility (overlap-free, allowable orientations), which create a sparse solution manifold ill-suited to purely statistical pixel-space generators. We propose a constraint-guided framework that combines explicit geometric reasoning with neural semantics. An AlphaGo-style search enforces feasibility, while a fine-tuned vision-language model scores semantic alignment as reward signals. Our algorithm uses a policy network as a heuristic in Monte-Carlo Tree Search and fine-tunes the network via search-generated plans. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network, we use the generated instances for adversarial reward refinement. Over time, the generation should approach the actual data more closely when the reward model cannot distinguish between generated instances and ground-truth. In the Tangram Assembly task, our approach yields higher validity and semantic fidelity than diffusion and auto-regressive baselines, especially as constraints tighten.</description>

      <title>Rewarding the Rare: Uniqueness-Aware RL for Creative Problem Solving in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), particularly for complex reasoning tasks, yet it often suffers from exploration collapse: policies prematurely concentrate on a small set of dominant reasoning patterns, improving pass@1 while limiting rollout-level diversity and gains in pass@k. We argue that this failure stems from regularizing local token behavior rather than diversity over sets of solutions. To address this, we propose Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement Learning, a rollout-level objective that explicitly rewards correct solutions that exhibit rare high-level strategies. Our method uses an LLM-based judge to cluster rollouts for the same problem according to their high-level solution strategies, ignoring superficial variations, and reweights policy advantages inversely with cluster size. As a result, correct but novel strategies receive higher rewards than redundant ones. Across mathematics, physics, and medical reasoning benchmarks, our approach consistently improves pass@$k$ across large sampling budgets and increases the area under the pass@$k$ curve (AUC@$K$) without sacrificing pass@1, while sustaining exploration and uncovering more diverse solution strategies at scale.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems have evolved into practical LLM-driven collaborators for many applications, gaining robustness from diversity and cross-checking. However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce \textbf{Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL)}, a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inference time. MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of specialists for multi-turn discussions, retrieves and integrates test-time experiences, and reaches consensus for final decision-making. We also study credit assignment for constructing a turn-level experience pool, then reinjecting it into the dialogue. Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\% over comparable single-agent baselines. Ablation studies examine different credit-assignment schemes and provide a detailed comparison of how they affect training outcomes. MATTRL offers a stable, effective and efficient path to distribution-shift-robust multi-agent reasoning without tuning.</description>
