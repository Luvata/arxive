      <title>Generative AI in Ship Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of ship design is intricate, heavily influenced by the hull form which accounts for approximately 70% of the total cost. Traditional methods rely on human-driven iterative processes based on naval architecture principles and engineering analysis. In contrast, generative AI presents a novel approach, utilizing computational algorithms rooted in machine learning and artificial intelligence to optimize ship hull design. This report outlines the systematic creation of a generative AI for this purpose, involving steps such as dataset collection, model architecture selection, training, and validation. Utilizing the "SHIP-D" dataset, consisting of 30,000 hull forms, the report adopts the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as the generative model architecture. GMMs offer a statistical framework to analyze data distribution, crucial for generating innovative ship designs efficiently. Overall, this approach holds promise in revolutionizing ship design by exploring a broader design space and integrating multidisciplinary optimization objectives effectively.</description>

      <title>HLogformer: A Hierarchical Transformer for Representing Log Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have gained widespread acclaim for their versatility in handling diverse data structures, yet their application to log data remains underexplored. Log data, characterized by its hierarchical, dictionary-like structure, poses unique challenges when processed using conventional transformer models. Traditional methods often rely on manually crafted templates for parsing logs, a process that is labor-intensive and lacks generalizability. Additionally, the linear treatment of log sequences by standard transformers neglects the rich, nested relationships within log entries, leading to suboptimal representations and excessive memory usage.
  To address these issues, we introduce HLogformer, a novel hierarchical transformer framework specifically designed for log data. HLogformer leverages the hierarchical structure of log entries to significantly reduce memory costs and enhance representation learning. Unlike traditional models that treat log data as flat sequences, our framework processes log entries in a manner that respects their inherent hierarchical organization. This approach ensures comprehensive encoding of both fine-grained details and broader contextual relationships.
  Our contributions are threefold: First, HLogformer is the first framework to design a dynamic hierarchical transformer tailored for dictionary-like log data. Second, it dramatically reduces memory costs associated with processing extensive log sequences. Third, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HLogformer more effectively encodes hierarchical contextual information, proving to be highly effective for downstream tasks such as synthetic anomaly detection and product recommendation.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Research on the Adaptability of Adolescents to Online Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of internet technology, the adaptability of adolescents to online learning has emerged as a focal point of interest within the educational sphere. However, the academic community's efforts to develop predictive models for adolescent online learning adaptability require further refinement and expansion. Utilizing data from the "Chinese Adolescent Online Education Survey" spanning the years 2014 to 2016, this study implements five machine learning algorithms - logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, random forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost - to analyze the factors influencing adolescent online learning adaptability and to determine the model best suited for prediction. The research reveals that the duration of courses, the financial status of the family, and age are the primary factors affecting students' adaptability in online learning environments. Additionally, age significantly impacts students' adaptive capacities. Among the predictive models, the random forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost algorithms demonstrate superior forecasting capabilities, with the random forest model being particularly adept at capturing the characteristics of students' adaptability.</description>

      <title>The Star Geometry of Critic-Based Regularizer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational regularization is a classical technique to solve statistical inference tasks and inverse problems, with modern data-driven approaches parameterizing regularizers via deep neural networks showcasing impressive empirical performance. Recent works along these lines learn task-dependent regularizers. This is done by integrating information about the measurements and ground-truth data in an unsupervised, critic-based loss function, where the regularizer attributes low values to likely data and high values to unlikely data. However, there is little theory about the structure of regularizers learned via this process and how it relates to the two data distributions. To make progress on this challenge, we initiate a study of optimizing critic-based loss functions to learn regularizers over a particular family of regularizers: gauges (or Minkowski functionals) of star-shaped bodies. This family contains regularizers that are commonly employed in practice and shares properties with regularizers parameterized by deep neural networks. We specifically investigate critic-based losses derived from variational representations of statistical distances between probability measures. By leveraging tools from star geometry and dual Brunn-Minkowski theory, we illustrate how these losses can be interpreted as dual mixed volumes that depend on the data distribution. This allows us to derive exact expressions for the optimal regularizer in certain cases. Finally, we identify which neural network architectures give rise to such star body gauges and when do such regularizers have favorable properties for optimization. More broadly, this work highlights how the tools of star geometry can aid in understanding the geometry of unsupervised regularizer learning.</description>

      <title>GSTAM: Efficient Graph Distillation with Structural Attention-Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph distillation has emerged as a solution for reducing large graph datasets to smaller, more manageable, and informative ones. Existing methods primarily target node classification, involve computationally intensive processes, and fail to capture the true distribution of the full graph dataset. To address these issues, we introduce Graph Distillation with Structural Attention Matching (GSTAM), a novel method for condensing graph classification datasets. GSTAM leverages the attention maps of GNNs to distill structural information from the original dataset into synthetic graphs. The structural attention-matching mechanism exploits the areas of the input graph that GNNs prioritize for classification, effectively distilling such information into the synthetic graphs and improving overall distillation performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate GSTAM's superiority over existing methods, achieving 0.45% to 6.5% better performance in extreme condensation ratios, highlighting its potential use in advancing distillation for graph classification tasks (Code available at https://github.com/arashrasti96/GSTAM).</description>

      <title>Revising Multimodal VAEs with Diffusion Decoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal VAEs often struggle with generating high-quality outputs, a challenge that extends beyond the inherent limitations of the VAE framework. The core issue lies in the restricted joint representation of the latent space, particularly when complex modalities like images are involved. Feedforward decoders, commonly used for these intricate modalities, inadvertently constrain the joint latent space, leading to a degradation in the quality of the other modalities as well. Although recent studies have shown improvement by introducing modality-specific representations, the issue remains significant. In this work, we demonstrate that incorporating a flexible diffusion decoder specifically for the image modality not only enhances the generation quality of the images but also positively impacts the performance of the other modalities that rely on feedforward decoders. This approach addresses the limitations imposed by conventional joint representations and opens up new possibilities for improving multimodal generation tasks using the multimodal VAE framework. Our model provides state-of-the-art results compared to other multimodal VAEs in different datasets with higher coherence and superior quality in the generated modalities</description>

      <title>DLFormer: Enhancing Explainability in Multivariate Time Series Forecasting using Distributed Lag Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: . Most real-world variables are multivariate time series influenced by past values and explanatory factors. Consequently, predicting these time series data using artificial intelligence is ongoing. In particular, in fields such as healthcare and finance, where reliability is crucial, having understandable explanations for predictions is essential. However, achieving a balance between high prediction accuracy and intuitive explainability has proven challenging. Although attention-based models have limitations in representing the individual influences of each variable, these models can influence the temporal dependencies in time series prediction and the magnitude of the influence of individual variables. To address this issue, this study introduced DLFormer, an attention-based architecture integrated with distributed lag embedding, to temporally embed individual variables and capture their temporal influence. Through validation against various real-world datasets, DLFormer showcased superior performance improvements compared to existing attention-based high-performance models. Furthermore, comparing the relationships between variables enhanced the reliability of explainability.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Inference Privacy Risks Through Gradients in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In distributed learning settings, models are iteratively updated with shared gradients computed from potentially sensitive user data. While previous work has studied various privacy risks of sharing gradients, our paper aims to provide a systematic approach to analyze private information leakage from gradients. We present a unified game-based framework that encompasses a broad range of attacks including attribute, property, distributional, and user disclosures. We investigate how different uncertainties of the adversary affect their inferential power via extensive experiments on five datasets across various data modalities. Our results demonstrate the inefficacy of solely relying on data aggregation to achieve privacy against inference attacks in distributed learning. We further evaluate five types of defenses, namely, gradient pruning, signed gradient descent, adversarial perturbations, variational information bottleneck, and differential privacy, under both static and adaptive adversary settings. We provide an information-theoretic view for analyzing the effectiveness of these defenses against inference from gradients. Finally, we introduce a method for auditing attribute inference privacy, improving the empirical estimation of worst-case privacy through crafting adversarial canary records.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Insights into Overparameterized Models in Multi-Task and Replay-Based Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) is a machine learning paradigm that aims to improve the generalization performance of a model on multiple related tasks by training it simultaneously on those tasks. Unlike MTL, where the model has instant access to the training data of all tasks, continual learning (CL) involves adapting to new sequentially arriving tasks over time without forgetting the previously acquired knowledge. Despite the wide practical adoption of CL and MTL and extensive literature on both areas, there remains a gap in the theoretical understanding of these methods when used with overparameterized models such as deep neural networks. This paper studies the overparameterized linear models as a proxy for more complex models. We develop theoretical results describing the effect of various system parameters on the model's performance in an MTL setup. Specifically, we study the impact of model size, dataset size, and task similarity on the generalization error and knowledge transfer. Additionally, we present theoretical results to characterize the performance of replay-based CL models. Our results reveal the impact of buffer size and model capacity on the forgetting rate in a CL setup and help shed light on some of the state-of-the-art CL methods. Finally, through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that our theoretical findings are also applicable to deep neural networks, offering valuable guidance for designing MTL and CL models in practice.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Scaling Laws for Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a limited empirical study of scaling laws for transfer learning in transformer models. More specifically, we examine a scaling law that incorporates a "transfer gap" term, indicating the effectiveness of pre-training on one distribution when optimizing for downstream performance on another distribution. When the transfer gap is low, pre-training is a cost-effective strategy for improving downstream performance. Conversely, when the gap is high, collecting high-quality fine-tuning data becomes relatively more cost effective. Fitting the scaling law to experiments from diverse datasets reveals significant variations in the transfer gap across distributions. In theory, the scaling law can inform optimal data allocation strategies and highlights how the scarcity of downstream data can bottleneck performance. Our findings contribute to a principled way to measure transfer learning efficiency and understand how data availability affects capabilities.</description>

      <title>Discovery of False Data Injection Schemes on Frequency Controllers with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While inverter-based distributed energy resources (DERs) play a crucial role in integrating renewable energy into the power system, they concurrently diminish the grid's system inertia, elevating the risk of frequency instabilities. Furthermore, smart inverters, interfaced via communication networks, pose a potential vulnerability to cyber threats if not diligently managed. To proactively fortify the power grid against sophisticated cyber attacks, we propose to employ reinforcement learning (RL) to identify potential threats and system vulnerabilities. This study concentrates on analyzing adversarial strategies for false data injection, specifically targeting smart inverters involved in primary frequency control. Our findings demonstrate that an RL agent can adeptly discern optimal false data injection methods to manipulate inverter settings, potentially causing catastrophic consequences.</description>

      <title>UserSumBench: A Benchmark Framework for Evaluating User Summarization Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in generating user summaries from a long list of raw user activity data. These summaries capture essential user information such as preferences and interests, and therefore are invaluable for LLM-based personalization applications, such as explainable recommender systems. However, the development of new summarization techniques is hindered by the lack of ground-truth labels, the inherent subjectivity of user summaries, and human evaluation which is often costly and time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce \UserSumBench, a benchmark framework designed to facilitate iterative development of LLM-based summarization approaches. This framework offers two key components: (1) A reference-free summary quality metric. We show that this metric is effective and aligned with human preferences across three diverse datasets (MovieLens, Yelp and Amazon Review). (2) A novel robust summarization method that leverages time-hierarchical summarizer and self-critique verifier to produce high-quality summaries while eliminating hallucination. This method serves as a strong baseline for further innovation in summarization techniques.</description>

      <title>Point Neuron Learning: A New Physics-Informed Neural Network Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning and neural networks have advanced numerous research domains, but challenges such as large training data requirements and inconsistent model performance hinder their application in certain scientific problems. To overcome these challenges, researchers have investigated integrating physics principles into machine learning models, mainly through: (i) physics-guided loss functions, generally termed as physics-informed neural networks, and (ii) physics-guided architectural design. While both approaches have demonstrated success across multiple scientific disciplines, they have limitations including being trapped to a local minimum, poor interpretability, and restricted generalizability. This paper proposes a new physics-informed neural network (PINN) architecture that combines the strengths of both approaches by embedding the fundamental solution of the wave equation into the network architecture, enabling the learned model to strictly satisfy the wave equation. The proposed point neuron learning method can model an arbitrary sound field based on microphone observations without any dataset. Compared to other PINN methods, our approach directly processes complex numbers and offers better interpretability and generalizability. We evaluate the versatility of the proposed architecture by a sound field reconstruction problem in a reverberant environment. Results indicate that the point neuron method outperforms two competing methods and can efficiently handle noisy environments with sparse microphone observations.</description>

      <title>The Sample-Communication Complexity Trade-off in Federated Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of federated Q-learning, where $M$ agents aim to collaboratively learn the optimal Q-function of an unknown infinite-horizon Markov decision process with finite state and action spaces. We investigate the trade-off between sample and communication complexities for the widely used class of intermittent communication algorithms. We first establish the converse result, where it is shown that a federated Q-learning algorithm that offers any speedup with respect to the number of agents in the per-agent sample complexity needs to incur a communication cost of at least an order of $\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$ up to logarithmic factors, where $\gamma$ is the discount factor. We also propose a new algorithm, called Fed-DVR-Q, which is the first federated Q-learning algorithm to simultaneously achieve order-optimal sample and communication complexities. Thus, together these results provide a complete characterization of the sample-communication complexity trade-off in federated Q-learning.</description>

      <title>From Model Explanation to Data Misinterpretation: Uncovering the Pitfalls of Post Hoc Explainers in Business Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models have been increasingly used in business research. However, most state-of-the-art machine learning models, such as deep neural networks and XGBoost, are black boxes in nature. Therefore, post hoc explainers that provide explanations for machine learning models by, for example, estimating numerical importance of the input features, have been gaining wide usage. Despite the intended use of post hoc explainers being explaining machine learning models, we found a growing trend in business research where post hoc explanations are used to draw inferences about the data. In this work, we investigate the validity of such use. Specifically, we investigate with extensive experiments whether the explanations obtained by the two most popular post hoc explainers, SHAP and LIME, provide correct information about the true marginal effects of X on Y in the data, which we call data-alignment. We then identify what factors influence the alignment of explanations. Finally, we propose a set of mitigation strategies to improve the data-alignment of explanations and demonstrate their effectiveness with real-world data in an econometric context. In spite of this effort, we nevertheless conclude that it is often not appropriate to infer data insights from post hoc explanations. We articulate appropriate alternative uses, the most important of which is to facilitate the proposition and subsequent empirical investigation of hypotheses. The ultimate goal of this paper is to caution business researchers against translating post hoc explanations of machine learning models into potentially false insights and understanding of data.</description>

      <title>A Scalable k-Medoids Clustering via Whale Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised clustering has emerged as a critical tool for uncovering hidden patterns and insights from vast, unlabeled datasets. However, traditional methods like Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) struggle with scalability due to their quadratic computational complexity. To address this limitation, we introduce WOA-kMedoids, a novel unsupervised clustering method that incorporates the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), a nature-inspired metaheuristic inspired by the hunting strategies of humpback whales. By optimizing centroid selection, WOA-kMedoids reduces computational complexity of the k-medoids algorithm from quadratic to near-linear with respect to the number of observations. This improvement in efficiency enables WOA-kMedoids to be scalable to large datasets while maintaining high clustering accuracy. We evaluated the performance of WOA-kMedoids on 25 diverse time series datasets from the UCR archive. Our empirical results demonstrate that WOA-kMedoids maintains clustering accuracy similar to PAM. While WOA-kMedoids exhibited slightly higher runtime than PAM on small datasets (less than 300 observations), it outperformed PAM in computational efficiency on larger datasets. The scalability of WOA-kMedoids, combined with its consistently high accuracy, positions it as a promising and practical choice for unsupervised clustering in big data applications. WOA-kMedoids has implications for efficient knowledge discovery in massive, unlabeled datasets across various domains.</description>

      <title>A Tighter Convergence Proof of Reverse Experience Replay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning, Reverse Experience Replay (RER) is a recently proposed algorithm that attains better sample complexity than the classic experience replay method. RER requires the learning algorithm to update the parameters through consecutive state-action-reward tuples in reverse order. However, the most recent theoretical analysis only holds for a minimal learning rate and short consecutive steps, which converge slower than those large learning rate algorithms without RER. In view of this theoretical and empirical gap, we provide a tighter analysis that mitigates the limitation on the learning rate and the length of consecutive steps. Furthermore, we show theoretically that RER converges with a larger learning rate and a longer sequence.</description>

      <title>Improving Time Series Classification with Representation Soft Label Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous research has indicated that deep neural network based models for time series classification (TSC) tasks are prone to overfitting. This issue can be mitigated by employing strategies that prevent the model from becoming overly confident in its predictions, such as label smoothing and confidence penalty. Building upon the concept of label smoothing, we propose a novel approach to generate more reliable soft labels, which we refer to as representation soft label smoothing. We apply label smoothing, confidence penalty, and our method representation soft label smoothing to several TSC models and compare their performance with baseline method which only uses hard labels for training. Our results demonstrate that the use of these enhancement techniques yields competitive results compared to the baseline method. Importantly, our method demonstrates strong performance across models with varying structures and complexities.</description>

      <title>Error-controlled non-additive interaction discovery in machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are powerful tools for detecting complex patterns within data, yet their "black box" nature limits their interpretability, hindering their use in critical domains like healthcare and finance. To address this challenge, interpretable ML methods have been developed to explain how features influence model predictions. However, these methods often focus on univariate feature importance, overlooking the complex interactions between features that ML models are capable of capturing. Recognizing this limitation, recent efforts have aimed to extend these methods to discover feature interactions, but existing approaches struggle with robustness and error control, especially under data perturbations. In this study, we introduce Diamond, a novel method for trustworthy feature interaction discovery. Diamond uniquely integrates the model-X knockoffs framework to control the false discovery rate (FDR), ensuring that the proportion of falsely discovered interactions remains low. We further address the challenges of using off-the-shelf interaction importance measures by proposing a calibration procedure that refines these measures to maintain the desired FDR. Diamond's applicability spans a wide range of ML models, including deep neural networks, tree-based models, and factorization-based models. Our empirical evaluations on both simulated and real datasets across various biomedical studies demonstrate Diamond's utility in enabling more reliable data-driven scientific discoveries. This method represents a significant step forward in the deployment of ML models for scientific innovation and hypothesis generation.</description>

      <title>Estimating Conditional Average Treatment Effects via Sufficient Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the conditional average treatment effects (CATE) is very important in causal inference and has a wide range of applications across many fields. In the estimation process of CATE, the unconfoundedness assumption is typically required to ensure the identifiability of the regression problems. When estimating CATE using high-dimensional data, there have been many variable selection methods and neural network approaches based on representation learning, while these methods do not provide a way to verify whether the subset of variables after dimensionality reduction or the learned representations still satisfy the unconfoundedness assumption during the estimation process, which can lead to ineffective estimates of the treatment effects. Additionally, these methods typically use data from only the treatment or control group when estimating the regression functions for each group. This paper proposes a novel neural network approach named \textbf{CrossNet} to learn a sufficient representation for the features, based on which we then estimate the CATE, where cross indicates that in estimating the regression functions, we used data from their own group as well as cross-utilized data from another group. Numerical simulations and empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms the competitive approaches.</description>

      <title>FissionVAE: Federated Non-IID Image Generation with Latent Space and Decoder Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning is a machine learning paradigm that enables decentralized clients to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping all the training data local. While considerable research has focused on federated image generation, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders have received less attention. In this paper, we address the challenges of non-IID (independently and identically distributed) data environments featuring multiple groups of images of different types. Specifically, heterogeneous data distributions can lead to difficulties in maintaining a consistent latent space and can also result in local generators with disparate texture features being blended during aggregation. We introduce a novel approach, FissionVAE, which decomposes the latent space and constructs decoder branches tailored to individual client groups. This method allows for customized learning that aligns with the unique data distributions of each group. Additionally, we investigate the incorporation of hierarchical VAE architectures and demonstrate the use of heterogeneous decoder architectures within our model. We also explore strategies for setting the latent prior distributions to enhance the decomposition process. To evaluate our approach, we assemble two composite datasets: the first combines MNIST and FashionMNIST; the second comprises RGB datasets of cartoon and human faces, wild animals, marine vessels, and remote sensing images of Earth. Our experiments demonstrate that FissionVAE greatly improves generation quality on these datasets compared to baseline federated VAE models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerically robust, computationally efficient approach for non-I.I.D. data stream sampling in federated client systems, where resources are limited and labeled data for local model adaptation is sparse and expensive. The proposed method identifies relevant stream observations to optimize the underlying client model, given a local labeling budget, and performs instantaneous labeling decisions without relying on any memory buffering strategies. Our experiments show enhanced training batch diversity and an improved numerical robustness of the proposal compared to existing strategies over large-scale data streams, making our approach an effective and convenient solution in FL environments.</description>

      <title>Efficient Estimation of Unique Components in Independent Component Analysis by Matrix Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Independent component analysis (ICA) is a widely used method in various applications of signal processing and feature extraction. It extends principal component analysis (PCA) and can extract important and complicated components with small variances. One of the major problems of ICA is that the uniqueness of the solution is not guaranteed, unlike PCA. That is because there are many local optima in optimizing the objective function of ICA. It has been shown previously that the unique global optimum of ICA can be estimated from many random initializations by handcrafted thread computation. In this paper, the unique estimation of ICA is highly accelerated by reformulating the algorithm in matrix representation and reducing redundant calculations. Experimental results on artificial datasets and EEG data verified the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Controllable Edge-Type-Specific Interpretation in Multi-Relational Graph Neural Networks for Drug Response Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have been widely applied in critical decision-making areas that demand interpretable predictions, leading to the flourishing development of interpretability algorithms. However, current graph interpretability algorithms tend to emphasize generality and often overlook biological significance, thereby limiting their applicability in predicting cancer drug responses. In this paper, we propose a novel post-hoc interpretability algorithm for cancer drug response prediction, CETExplainer, which incorporates a controllable edge-type-specific weighting mechanism. It considers the mutual information between subgraphs and predictions, proposing a structural scoring approach to provide fine-grained, biologically meaningful explanations for predictive models. We also introduce a method for constructing ground truth based on real-world datasets to quantitatively evaluate the proposed interpretability algorithm. Empirical analysis on the real-world dataset demonstrates that CETExplainer achieves superior stability and improves explanation quality compared to leading algorithms, thereby offering a robust and insightful tool for cancer drug prediction.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Optimal Reaction Coordinates of Biomolecular System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Flow Matching for Reaction Coordinates (FMRC), a novel deep learning algorithm designed to identify optimal reaction coordinates (RC) in biomolecular reversible dynamics. FMRC is based on the mathematical principles of lumpability and decomposability, which we reformulate into a conditional probability framework for efficient data-driven optimization using deep generative models. While FMRC does not explicitly learn the well-established transfer operator or its eigenfunctions, it can effectively encode the dynamics of leading eigenfunctions of the system transfer operator into its low-dimensional RC space. We further quantitatively compare its performance with several state-of-the-art algorithms by evaluating the quality of Markov State Models (MSM) constructed in their respective RC spaces, demonstrating the superiority of FMRC in three increasingly complex biomolecular systems. Finally, we discuss its potential applications in downstream applications such as enhanced sampling methods and MSM construction.</description>

      <title>Towards Hyper-parameter-free Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adaptive synchronization techniques in federated learning (FL) for scaled global model updates show superior performance over the vanilla federated averaging (FedAvg) scheme. However, existing methods employ additional tunable hyperparameters on the server to determine the scaling factor. A contrasting approach is automated scaling analogous to tuning-free step-size schemes in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods, which offer competitive convergence rates and exhibit good empirical performance. In this work, we introduce two algorithms for automated scaling of global model updates. In our first algorithm, we establish that a descent-ensuring step-size regime at the clients ensures descent for the server objective. We show that such a scheme enables linear convergence for strongly convex federated objectives. Our second algorithm shows that the average of objective values of sampled clients is a practical and effective substitute for the objective function value at the server required for computing the scaling factor, whose computation is otherwise not permitted. Our extensive empirical results show that the proposed methods perform at par or better than the popular federated learning algorithms for both convex and non-convex problems. Our work takes a step towards designing hyper-parameter-free federated learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boosting is an extremely successful idea, allowing one to combine multiple low accuracy classifiers into a much more accurate voting classifier. In this work, we present a new and surprisingly simple Boosting algorithm that obtains a provably optimal sample complexity. Sample optimal Boosting algorithms have only recently been developed, and our new algorithm has the fastest runtime among all such algorithms and is the simplest to describe: Partition your training data into 5 disjoint pieces of equal size, run AdaBoost on each, and combine the resulting classifiers via a majority vote. In addition to this theoretical contribution, we also perform the first empirical comparison of the proposed sample optimal Boosting algorithms. Our pilot empirical study suggests that our new algorithm might outperform previous algorithms on large data sets.</description>

Abstract: Tabular data learning has extensive applications in deep learning but its existing embedding techniques are limited in numerical and categorical features such as the inability to capture complex relationships and engineering. This paper proposes a novel deep embedding framework with leverages lightweight deep neural networks to generate effective feature embeddings for tabular data in machine learning research. For numerical features, a two-step feature expansion and deep transformation technique is used to capture copious semantic information. For categorical features, a unique identification vector for each entity is referred by a compact lookup table with a parameterized deep embedding function to uniform the embedding size dimensions, and transformed into a embedding vector using deep neural network. Experiments are conducted on real-world datasets for performance evaluation.</description>

      <title>The Iterative Optimal Brain Surgeon: Faster Sparse Recovery by Leveraging Second-Order Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising footprint of machine learning has led to a focus on imposing \emph{model sparsity} as a means of reducing computational and memory costs. For deep neural networks (DNNs), the state-of-the-art accuracy-vs-sparsity is achieved by heuristics inspired by the classical Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) framework~\citep{lecun90brain, hassibi1992second, hassibi1993optimal}, which leverages loss curvature information to make better pruning decisions. Yet, these results still lack a solid theoretical understanding, and it is unclear whether they can be improved by leveraging connections to the wealth of work on sparse recovery algorithms. In this paper, we draw new connections between these two areas and present new sparse recovery algorithms inspired by the OBS framework that comes with theoretical guarantees under reasonable assumptions and have strong practical performance. Specifically, our work starts from the observation that we can leverage curvature information in OBS-like fashion upon the projection step of classic iterative sparse recovery algorithms such as IHT. We show for the first time that this leads both to improved convergence bounds under standard assumptions. Furthermore, we present extensions of this approach to the practical task of obtaining accurate sparse DNNs, and validate it experimentally at scale for Transformer-based models on vision and language tasks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Testable Learning of General Halfspaces with Adversarial Label Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the task of testable learning of general -- not necessarily homogeneous -- halfspaces with adversarial label noise with respect to the Gaussian distribution. In the testable learning framework, the goal is to develop a tester-learner such that if the data passes the tester, then one can trust the output of the robust learner on the data.Our main result is the first polynomial time tester-learner for general halfspaces that achieves dimension-independent misclassification error. At the heart of our approach is a new methodology to reduce testable learning of general halfspaces to testable learning of nearly homogeneous halfspaces that may be of broader interest.</description>

      <title>SafeTail: Efficient Tail Latency Optimization in Edge Service Scheduling via Computational Redundancy Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing tail latency while efficiently managing computational resources is crucial for delivering high-performance, latency-sensitive services in edge computing. Emerging applications, such as augmented reality, require low-latency computing services with high reliability on user devices, which often have limited computational capabilities. Consequently, these devices depend on nearby edge servers for processing. However, inherent uncertainties in network and computation latencies stemming from variability in wireless networks and fluctuating server loads make service delivery on time challenging. Existing approaches often focus on optimizing median latency but fall short of addressing the specific challenges of tail latency in edge environments, particularly under uncertain network and computational conditions. Although some methods do address tail latency, they typically rely on fixed or excessive redundancy and lack adaptability to dynamic network conditions, often being designed for cloud environments rather than the unique demands of edge computing. In this paper, we introduce SafeTail, a framework that meets both median and tail response time targets, with tail latency defined as latency beyond the 90^th percentile threshold. SafeTail addresses this challenge by selectively replicating services across multiple edge servers to meet target latencies. SafeTail employs a reward-based deep learning framework to learn optimal placement strategies, balancing the need to achieve target latencies with minimizing additional resource usage. Through trace-driven simulations, SafeTail demonstrated near-optimal performance and outperformed most baseline strategies across three diverse services.</description>

      <title>Short-term Wind Speed Forecasting for Power Integration in Smart Grids based on Hybrid LSSVM-SVMD Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to its minimal pollution and efficient energy use, wind energy has become one of the most widely exploited renewable energy resources. The successful integration of wind power into the grid system is contingent upon accurate wind speed forecasting models. However, the task of wind speed forecasting is challenging due to the inherent intermittent characteristics of wind speed. In this paper, a hybrid machine learning approach is developed for predicting short-term wind speed. First, the wind data was decomposed into modal components using Successive Variational Mode Decomposition (SVMD). Then, each sub-signal was fitted into a Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LSSVM) model, with its hyperparameter optimized by a novel variant of Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO), QPSO with elitist breeding (EBQPSO). Second, the residuals making up for the differences between the original wind series and the aggregate of the SVMD modes were modeled using long short-term model (LSTM). Then, the overall predicted values were computed using the aggregate of the LSSVM and the LSTM models. Finally, the performance of the proposed model was compared against state-of-the-art benchmark models for forecasting wind speed using two separate data sets collected from a local wind farm. Empirical results show significant improvement in performance by the proposed method, achieving a 1.21% to 32.76% reduction in root mean square error (RMSE) and a 2.05% to 40.75% reduction in mean average error (MAE) compared to the benchmark methods. The entire code implementation of this work is freely available in Github.</description>

      <title>Democratizing AI in Africa: FL for Low-Resource Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Africa faces significant challenges in healthcare delivery due to limited infrastructure and access to advanced medical technologies. This study explores the use of federated learning to overcome these barriers, focusing on perinatal health. We trained a fetal plane classifier using perinatal data from five African countries: Algeria, Ghana, Egypt, Malawi, and Uganda, along with data from Spanish hospitals. To incorporate the lack of computational resources in the analysis, we considered a heterogeneous set of devices, including a Raspberry Pi and several laptops, for model training. We demonstrate comparative performance between a centralized and a federated model, despite the compute limitations, and a significant improvement in model generalizability when compared to models trained only locally. These results show the potential for a future implementation at a large scale of a federated learning platform to bridge the accessibility gap and improve model generalizability with very little requirements.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider function spaces defined by self-attention networks without normalization, and theoretically analyze their geometry. Since these networks are polynomial, we rely on tools from algebraic geometry. In particular, we study the identifiability of deep attention by providing a description of the generic fibers of the parametrization for an arbitrary number of layers and, as a consequence, compute the dimension of the function space. Additionally, for a single-layer model, we characterize the singular and boundary points. Finally, we formulate a conjectural extension of our results to normalized self-attention networks, prove it for a single layer, and numerically verify it in the deep case.</description>

      <title>Categorical data clustering: 25 years beyond K-modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The clustering of categorical data is a common and important task in computer science, offering profound implications across a spectrum of applications. Unlike purely numerical datasets, categorical data often lack inherent ordering as in nominal data, or have varying levels of order as in ordinal data, thus requiring specialized methodologies for efficient organization and analysis. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of categorical data clustering in the past twenty-five years, starting from the introduction of K-modes. It elucidates the pivotal role of categorical data clustering in diverse fields such as health sciences, natural sciences, social sciences, education, engineering and economics. Practical comparisons are conducted for algorithms having public implementations, highlighting distinguishing clustering methodologies and revealing the performance of recent algorithms on several benchmark categorical datasets. Finally, challenges and opportunities in the field are discussed.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised learning for crystal property prediction via denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the properties of crystalline materials is crucial for targeted discovery, and this prediction is increasingly done with data-driven models. However, for many properties of interest, the number of materials for which a specific property has been determined is much smaller than the number of known materials. To overcome this disparity, we propose a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy for material property prediction. Our approach, crystal denoising self-supervised learning (CDSSL), pretrains predictive models (e.g., graph networks) with a pretext task based on recovering valid material structures when given perturbed versions of these structures. We demonstrate that CDSSL models out-perform models trained without SSL, across material types, properties, and dataset sizes.</description>

      <title>Joint Estimation and Prediction of City-wide Delivery Demand: A Large Language Model Empowered Graph-based Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of e-commerce and urbanization has significantly intensified delivery operations in urban areas, boosting the volume and complexity of delivery demand. Data-driven predictive methods, especially those utilizing machine learning techniques, have emerged to handle these complexities in urban delivery demand management problems. One particularly pressing problem that has not yet been sufficiently studied is the joint estimation and prediction of city-wide delivery demand. To this end, we formulate this problem as a graph-based spatiotemporal learning task. First, a message-passing neural network model is formalized to capture the interaction between demand patterns of associated regions. Second, by exploiting recent advances in large language models, we extract general geospatial knowledge encodings from the unstructured locational data and integrate them into the demand predictor. Last, to encourage the cross-city transferability of the model, an inductive training scheme is developed in an end-to-end routine. Extensive empirical results on two real-world delivery datasets, including eight cities in China and the US, demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in these challenging tasks.</description>

      <title>The Transferability of Downsampling Sparse Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a large-scale sparse graph downsampling method based on a sparse random graph model, which allows for the adjustment of different sparsity levels. We combine sparsity and topological similarity: the sparse graph model reduces the node connection probability as the graph size increases, while the downsampling method preserves a specific topological connection pattern during this change. Based on the downsampling method, we derive a theoretical transferability bound about downsampling sparse graph convolutional networks (GCNs), that higher sampling rates, greater average degree expectations, and smaller initial graph sizes lead to better downsampling transferability performance.</description>

      <title>Stationary Policies are Optimal in Risk-averse Total-reward MDPs with EVaR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing risk-averse objectives in discounted MDPs is challenging because most models do not admit direct dynamic programming equations and require complex history-dependent policies. In this paper, we show that the risk-averse {\em total reward criterion}, under the Entropic Risk Measure (ERM) and Entropic Value at Risk (EVaR) risk measures, can be optimized by a stationary policy, making it simple to analyze, interpret, and deploy. We propose exponential value iteration, policy iteration, and linear programming to compute optimal policies. In comparison with prior work, our results only require the relatively mild condition of transient MDPs and allow for {\em both} positive and negative rewards. Our results indicate that the total reward criterion may be preferable to the discounted criterion in a broad range of risk-averse reinforcement learning domains.</description>

      <title>Structuring a Training Strategy to Robustify Perception Models with Realistic Image Augmentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancing Machine Learning (ML)-based perception models for autonomous systems necessitates addressing weak spots within the models, particularly in challenging Operational Design Domains (ODDs). These are environmental operating conditions of an autonomous vehicle which can contain difficult conditions, e.g., lens flare at night or objects reflected in a wet street. This report introduces a novel methodology for training with augmentations to enhance model robustness and performance in such conditions. The proposed approach leverages customized physics-based augmentation functions, to generate realistic training data that simulates diverse ODD scenarios.
  We present a comprehensive framework that includes identifying weak spots in ML models, selecting suitable augmentations, and devising effective training strategies. The methodology integrates hyperparameter optimization and latent space optimization to fine-tune augmentation parameters, ensuring they maximally improve the ML models' performance. Experimental results demonstrate improvements in model performance, as measured by commonly used metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP) and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on open-source object detection and semantic segmentation models and datasets.
  Our findings emphasize that optimal training strategies are model- and data-specific and highlight the benefits of integrating augmentations into the training pipeline. By incorporating augmentations, we observe enhanced robustness of ML-based perception models, making them more resilient to edge cases encountered in real-world ODDs. This work underlines the importance of customized augmentations and offers an effective solution for improving the safety and reliability of autonomous driving functions.</description>

      <title>Fair Best Arm Identification with Fixed Confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel framework for Best Arm Identification (BAI) under fairness constraints, a setting that we refer to as \textit{F-BAI} (fair BAI). Unlike traditional BAI, which solely focuses on identifying the optimal arm with minimal sample complexity, F-BAI also includes a set of fairness constraints. These constraints impose a lower limit on the selection rate of each arm and can be either model-agnostic or model-dependent. For this setting, we establish an instance-specific sample complexity lower bound and analyze the \textit{price of fairness}, quantifying how fairness impacts sample complexity. Based on the sample complexity lower bound, we propose F-TaS, an algorithm provably matching the sample complexity lower bound, while ensuring that the fairness constraints are satisfied. Numerical results, conducted using both a synthetic model and a practical wireless scheduling application, show the efficiency of F-TaS in minimizing the sample complexity while achieving low fairness violations.</description>

      <title>Investigating Neuron Ablation in Attention Heads: The Case for Peak Activation Centering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of transformer-based models is growing rapidly throughout society. With this growth, it is important to understand how they work, and in particular, how the attention mechanisms represent concepts. Though there are many interpretability methods, many look at models through their neuronal activations, which are poorly understood. We describe different lenses through which to view neuron activations, and investigate the effectiveness in language models and vision transformers through various methods of neural ablation: zero ablation, mean ablation, activation resampling, and a novel approach we term 'peak ablation'. Through experimental analysis, we find that in different regimes and models, each method can offer the lowest degradation of model performance compared to other methods, with resampling usually causing the most significant performance deterioration. We make our code available at https://github.com/nickypro/investigating-ablation.</description>

      <title>Modularity in Transformers: Investigating Neuron Separability &amp; Specialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer models are increasingly prevalent in various applications, yet our understanding of their internal workings remains limited. This paper investigates the modularity and task specialization of neurons within transformer architectures, focusing on both vision (ViT) and language (Mistral 7B) models. Using a combination of selective pruning and MoEfication clustering techniques, we analyze the overlap and specialization of neurons across different tasks and data subsets. Our findings reveal evidence of task-specific neuron clusters, with varying degrees of overlap between related tasks. We observe that neuron importance patterns persist to some extent even in randomly initialized models, suggesting an inherent structure that training refines. Additionally, we find that neuron clusters identified through MoEfication correspond more strongly to task-specific neurons in earlier and later layers of the models. This work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of transformer internals and offers insights into potential avenues for improving model interpretability and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Forget to Flourish: Leveraging Machine-Unlearning on Pretrained Language Models for Privacy Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on private data for downstream applications poses significant privacy risks in potentially exposing sensitive information. Several popular community platforms now offer convenient distribution of a large variety of pre-trained models, allowing anyone to publish without rigorous verification. This scenario creates a privacy threat, as pre-trained models can be intentionally crafted to compromise the privacy of fine-tuning datasets. In this study, we introduce a novel poisoning technique that uses model-unlearning as an attack tool. This approach manipulates a pre-trained language model to increase the leakage of private data during the fine-tuning process. Our method enhances both membership inference and data extraction attacks while preserving model utility. Experimental results across different models, datasets, and fine-tuning setups demonstrate that our attacks significantly surpass baseline performance. This work serves as a cautionary note for users who download pre-trained models from unverified sources, highlighting the potential risks involved.</description>

      <title>C-RADAR: A Centralized Deep Learning System for Intrusion Detection in Software Defined Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The popularity of Software Defined Networks (SDNs) has grown in recent years, mainly because of their ability to simplify network management and improve network flexibility. However, this also makes them vulnerable to various types of cyber attacks. SDNs work on a centralized control plane which makes them more prone to network attacks. Research has demonstrated that deep learning (DL) methods can be successful in identifying intrusions in conventional networks, but their application in SDNs is still an open research area. In this research, we propose the use of DL techniques for intrusion detection in SDNs. We measure the effectiveness of our method by experimentation on a dataset of network traffic and comparing it to existing techniques. Our results show that the DL-based approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency. The deep learning architecture that has been used in this research is a Long Short Term Memory Network and Self-Attention based architecture i.e. LSTM-Attn which achieves an Fl-score of 0.9721. Furthermore, this technique can be trained to detect new attack patterns and improve the overall security of SDNs.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Graph Neural Networks to Forecast Electricity Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate electricity demand forecasting is essential for several reasons, especially as the integration of renewable energy sources and the transition to a decentralized network paradigm introduce greater complexity and uncertainty. The proposed methodology leverages graph-based representations to effectively capture the spatial distribution and relational intricacies inherent in this decentralized network structure. This research work offers a novel approach that extends beyond the conventional Generalized Additive Model framework by considering models like Graph Convolutional Networks or Graph SAGE. These graph-based models enable the incorporation of various levels of interconnectedness and information sharing among nodes, where each node corresponds to the combined load (i.e. consumption) of a subset of consumers (e.g. the regions of a country). More specifically, we introduce a range of methods for inferring graphs tailored to consumption forecasting, along with a framework for evaluating the developed models in terms of both performance and explainability. We conduct experiments on electricity forecasting, in both a synthetic and a real framework considering the French mainland regions, and the performance and merits of our approach are discussed.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Impact of Environmental Pollutants on Multiple Sclerosis Progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune and inflammatory neurological disorder characterised by episodes of symptom exacerbation, known as relapses. In this study, we investigate the role of environmental factors in relapse occurrence among MS patients, using data from the H2020 BRAINTEASER project. We employed predictive models, including Random Forest (RF) and Logistic Regression (LR), with varying sets of input features to predict the occurrence of relapses based on clinical and pollutant data collected over a week. The RF yielded the best result, with an AUC-ROC score of 0.713. Environmental variables, such as precipitation, NO2, PM2.5, humidity, and temperature, were found to be relevant to the prediction.</description>

      <title>MoRe Fine-Tuning with 10x Fewer Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques have unlocked the potential to cheaply and easily specialize large pretrained models. However, the most prominent approaches, like low-rank adapters (LoRA), depend on heuristics or rules-of-thumb for their architectural choices -- potentially limiting their performance for new models and architectures. This limitation suggests that techniques from neural architecture search could be used to obtain optimal adapter architectures, but these are often expensive and difficult to implement. We address this challenge with Monarch Rectangular Fine-tuning (MoRe), a simple framework to search over adapter architectures that relies on the Monarch matrix class. Theoretically, we show that MoRe is more expressive than LoRA. Empirically, our approach is more parameter-efficient and performant than state-of-the-art PEFTs on a range of tasks and models, with as few as 5\% of LoRA's parameters.</description>

      <title>LASSO-MOGAT: A Multi-Omics Graph Attention Framework for Cancer Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of machine learning methods to analyze changes in gene expression patterns has recently emerged as a powerful approach in cancer research, enhancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning cancer development and progression. Combining gene expression data with other types of omics data has been reported by numerous works to improve cancer classification outcomes. Despite these advances, effectively integrating high-dimensional multi-omics data and capturing the complex relationships across different biological layers remains challenging. This paper introduces LASSO-MOGAT (LASSO-Multi-Omics Gated ATtention), a novel graph-based deep learning framework that integrates messenger RNA, microRNA, and DNA methylation data to classify 31 cancer types. Utilizing differential expression analysis with LIMMA and LASSO regression for feature selection, and leveraging Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to incorporate protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, LASSO-MOGAT effectively captures intricate relationships within multi-omics data. Experimental validation using five-fold cross-validation demonstrates the method's precision, reliability, and capacity for providing comprehensive insights into cancer molecular mechanisms. The computation of attention coefficients for the edges in the graph by the proposed graph-attention architecture based on protein-protein interactions proved beneficial for identifying synergies in multi-omics data for cancer classification.</description>

      <title>Continual learning with the neural tangent ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A natural strategy for continual learning is to weigh a Bayesian ensemble of fixed functions. This suggests that if a (single) neural network could be interpreted as an ensemble, one could design effective algorithms that learn without forgetting. To realize this possibility, we observe that a neural network classifier with N parameters can be interpreted as a weighted ensemble of N classifiers, and that in the lazy regime limit these classifiers are fixed throughout learning. We term these classifiers the neural tangent experts and show they output valid probability distributions over the labels. We then derive the likelihood and posterior probability of each expert given past data. Surprisingly, we learn that the posterior updates for these experts are equivalent to a scaled and projected form of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) over the network weights. Away from the lazy regime, networks can be seen as ensembles of adaptive experts which improve over time. These results offer a new interpretation of neural networks as Bayesian ensembles of experts, providing a principled framework for understanding and mitigating catastrophic forgetting in continual learning settings.</description>

      <title>Fairness-Aware Estimation of Graphical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the issue of fairness in the estimation of graphical models (GMs), particularly Gaussian, Covariance, and Ising models. These models play a vital role in understanding complex relationships in high-dimensional data. However, standard GMs can result in biased outcomes, especially when the underlying data involves sensitive characteristics or protected groups. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive framework designed to reduce bias in the estimation of GMs related to protected attributes. Our approach involves the integration of the pairwise graph disparity error and a tailored loss function into a nonsmooth multi-objective optimization problem, striving to achieve fairness across different sensitive groups while maintaining the effectiveness of the GMs. Experimental evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively mitigates bias without undermining GMs' performance.</description>

      <title>An Effective Information Theoretic Framework for Channel Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel pruning is a promising method for accelerating and compressing convolutional neural networks. However, current pruning algorithms still remain unsolved problems that how to assign layer-wise pruning ratios properly and discard the least important channels with a convincing criterion. In this paper, we present a novel channel pruning approach via information theory and interpretability of neural networks. Specifically, we regard information entropy as the expected amount of information for convolutional layers. In addition, if we suppose a matrix as a system of linear equations, a higher-rank matrix represents there exist more solutions to it, which indicates more uncertainty. From the point of view of information theory, the rank can also describe the amount of information. In a neural network, considering the rank and entropy as two information indicators of convolutional layers, we propose a fusion function to reach a compromise of them, where the fusion results are defined as ``information concentration''. When pre-defining layer-wise pruning ratios, we employ the information concentration as a reference instead of heuristic and engineering tuning to provide a more interpretable solution. Moreover, we leverage Shapley values, which are a potent tool in the interpretability of neural networks, to evaluate the channel contributions and discard the least important channels for model compression while maintaining its performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and promising performance of our method. For example, our method improves the accuracy by 0.21% when reducing 45.5% FLOPs and removing 40.3% parameters for ResNet-56 on CIFAR-10. Moreover, our method obtains loss in Top-1/Top-5 accuracies of 0.43%/0.11% by reducing 41.6% FLOPs and removing 35.0% parameters for ResNet-50 on ImageNet.</description>

      <title>Advance Real-time Detection of Traffic Incidents in Highways using Vehicle Trajectory Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant number of traffic crashes are secondary crashes that occur because of an earlier incident on the road. Thus, early detection of traffic incidents is crucial for road users from safety perspectives with a potential to reduce the risk of secondary crashes. The wide availability of GPS devices now-a-days gives an opportunity of tracking and recording vehicle trajectories. The objective of this study is to use vehicle trajectory data for advance real-time detection of traffic incidents on highways using machine learning-based algorithms. The study uses three days of unevenly sequenced vehicle trajectory data and traffic incident data on I-10, one of the most crash-prone highways in Louisiana. Vehicle trajectories are converted to trajectories based on virtual detector locations to maintain spatial uniformity as well as to generate historical traffic data for machine learning algorithms. Trips matched with traffic incidents on the way are separated and along with other trips with similar spatial attributes are used to build a database for modeling. Multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boost, and Artificial Neural Network models are used to detect a trajectory that is likely to face an incident in the downstream road section. Results suggest that the Random Forest model achieves the best performance for predicting an incident with reasonable recall value and discrimination capability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasts are crucial for applications such as flood management, agricultural planning, water resource allocation, and weather warnings. Despite advances in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, they still exhibit significant biases and uncertainties, especially at high spatial and temporal resolutions. To address these limitations, we explore uncertainty-aware deep learning models for post-processing daily cumulative quantitative precipitation forecasts to obtain forecast uncertainties that lead to a better trade-off between accuracy and reliability. Our study compares different state-of-the-art models, and we propose a variant of the well-known SDE-Net, called SDE U-Net, tailored to segmentation problems like ours. We evaluate its performance for both typical and intense precipitation events.
  Our results show that all deep learning models significantly outperform the average baseline NWP solution, with our implementation of the SDE U-Net showing the best trade-off between accuracy and reliability. Integrating these models, which account for uncertainty, into operational forecasting systems can improve decision-making and preparedness for weather-related events.</description>

Abstract: This study develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting myocardial infarction (MI) from Electrocardiogram (ECG) images. The model, built using the InceptionV3 architecture and optimized through transfer learning, was trained using ECG data obtained from the Ch. Pervaiz Elahi Institute of Cardiology in Pakistan. The dataset includes ECG images representing four different cardiac conditions: myocardial infarction, abnormal heartbeat, history of myocardial infarction, and normal heart activity. The developed model successfully detects MI and other cardiovascular conditions with an accuracy of 93.27%. This study demonstrates that deep learning-based models can provide significant support to clinicians in the early detection and prevention of heart attacks.</description>

      <title>Maven: A Multimodal Foundation Model for Supernova Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common setting in astronomy is the availability of a small number of high-quality observations, and larger amounts of either lower-quality observations or synthetic data from simplified models. Time-domain astrophysics is a canonical example of this imbalance, with the number of supernovae observed photometrically outpacing the number observed spectroscopically by multiple orders of magnitude. At the same time, no data-driven models exist to understand these photometric and spectroscopic observables in a common context. Contrastive learning objectives, which have grown in popularity for aligning distinct data modalities in a shared embedding space, provide a potential solution to extract information from these modalities. We present Maven, the first foundation model for supernova science. To construct Maven, we first pre-train our model to align photometry and spectroscopy from 0.5M synthetic supernovae using a constrastive objective. We then fine-tune the model on 4,702 observed supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility. Maven reaches state-of-the-art performance on both classification and redshift estimation, despite the embeddings not being explicitly optimized for these tasks. Through ablation studies, we show that pre-training with synthetic data improves overall performance. In the upcoming era of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, Maven serves as a Rosetta Stone for leveraging large, unlabeled and multimodal time-domain datasets.</description>

      <title>AdapShare: An RL-Based Dynamic Spectrum Sharing Solution for O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) initiative, characterized by open interfaces and AI/ML-capable RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), facilitates effective spectrum sharing among RANs. In this context, we introduce AdapShare, an ORAN-compatible solution leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL) for intent-based spectrum management, with the primary goal of minimizing resource surpluses or deficits in RANs. By employing RL agents, AdapShare intelligently learns network demand patterns and uses them to allocate resources. We demonstrate the efficacy of AdapShare in the spectrum sharing scenario between LTE and NR networks, incorporating real-world LTE resource usage data and synthetic NR usage data to demonstrate its practical use. We use the average surplus or deficit and fairness index to measure the system's performance in various scenarios. AdapShare outperforms a quasi-static resource allocation scheme based on long-term network demand statistics, particularly when available resources are scarce or exceed the aggregate demand from the networks. Lastly, we present a high-level O-RAN compatible architecture using RL agents, which demonstrates the seamless integration of AdapShare into real-world deployment scenarios.</description>

      <title>Enabling Local Editing in Diffusion Models by Joint and Individual Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Diffusion Models (DMs) have led to significant progress in visual synthesis and editing tasks, establishing them as a strong competitor to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). However, the latent space of DMs is not as well understood as that of GANs. Recent research has focused on unsupervised semantic discovery in the latent space of DMs by leveraging the bottleneck layer of the denoising network, which has been shown to exhibit properties of a semantic latent space. However, these approaches are limited to discovering global attributes. In this paper we address, the challenge of local image manipulation in DMs and introduce an unsupervised method to factorize the latent semantics learned by the denoising network of pre-trained DMs. Given an arbitrary image and defined regions of interest, we utilize the Jacobian of the denoising network to establish a relation between the regions of interest and their corresponding subspaces in the latent space. Furthermore, we disentangle the joint and individual components of these subspaces to identify latent directions that enable local image manipulation. Once discovered, these directions can be applied to different images to produce semantically consistent edits, making our method suitable for practical applications. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that our method can produce semantic edits that are more localized and have better fidelity compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Decomposed Linear Dynamical Systems for Robust Discovery of Latent Neural Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-varying linear state-space models are powerful tools for obtaining mathematically interpretable representations of neural signals. For example, switching and decomposed models describe complex systems using latent variables that evolve according to simple locally linear dynamics. However, existing methods for latent variable estimation are not robust to dynamical noise and system nonlinearity due to noise-sensitive inference procedures and limited model formulations. This can lead to inconsistent results on signals with similar dynamics, limiting the model's ability to provide scientific insight. In this work, we address these limitations and propose a probabilistic approach to latent variable estimation in decomposed models that improves robustness against dynamical noise. Additionally, we introduce an extended latent dynamics model to improve robustness against system nonlinearities. We evaluate our approach on several synthetic dynamical systems, including an empirically-derived brain-computer interface experiment, and demonstrate more accurate latent variable inference in nonlinear systems with diverse noise conditions. Furthermore, we apply our method to a real-world clinical neurophysiology dataset, illustrating the ability to identify interpretable and coherent structure where previous models cannot.</description>

      <title>Characterization of point-source transient events with a rolling-shutter compressed sensing system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point-source transient events (PSTEs) - optical events that are both extremely fast and extremely small - pose several challenges to an imaging system. Due to their speed, accurately characterizing such events often requires detectors with very high frame rates. Due to their size, accurately detecting such events requires maintaining coverage over an extended field-of-view, often through the use of imaging focal plane arrays (FPA) with a global shutter readout. Traditional imaging systems that meet these requirements are costly in terms of price, size, weight, power consumption, and data bandwidth, and there is a need for cheaper solutions with adequate temporal and spatial coverage. To address these issues, we develop a novel compressed sensing algorithm adapted to the rolling shutter readout of an imaging system. This approach enables reconstruction of a PSTE signature at the sampling rate of the rolling shutter, offering a 1-2 order of magnitude temporal speedup and a proportional reduction in data bandwidth. We present empirical results demonstrating accurate recovery of PSTEs using measurements that are spatially undersampled by a factor of 25, and our simulations show that, relative to other compressed sensing algorithms, our algorithm is both faster and yields higher quality reconstructions. We also present theoretical results characterizing our algorithm and corroborating simulations. The potential impact of our work includes the development of much faster, cheaper sensor solutions for PSTE detection and characterization.</description>

      <title>Learning Multi-agent Multi-machine Tending by Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotics can help address the growing worker shortage challenge of the manufacturing industry. As such, machine tending is a task collaborative robots can tackle that can also highly boost productivity. Nevertheless, existing robotics systems deployed in that sector rely on a fixed single-arm setup, whereas mobile robots can provide more flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce a multi-agent multi-machine tending learning framework by mobile robots based on Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) techniques with the design of a suitable observation and reward. Moreover, an attention-based encoding mechanism is developed and integrated into Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm to boost its performance for machine tending scenarios. Our model (AB-MAPPO) outperformed MAPPO in this new challenging scenario in terms of task success, safety, and resources utilization. Furthermore, we provided an extensive ablation study to support our various design decisions.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Modularity, a Modularity for Link Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal networks are commonly used to model real-life phenomena. When these phenomena represent interactions and are captured at a fine-grained temporal resolution, they are modeled as link streams. Community detection is an essential network analysis task. Although many methods exist for static networks, and some methods have been developed for temporal networks represented as sequences of snapshots, few works can handle link streams. This article introduces the first adaptation of the well-known Modularity quality function to link streams. Unlike existing methods, it is independent of the time scale of analysis. After introducing the quality function, and its relation to existing static and dynamic definitions of Modularity, we show experimentally its relevance for dynamic community evaluation.</description>

      <title>Coverage Analysis of Multi-Environment Q-Learning Algorithms for Wireless Network Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Q-learning is widely used to optimize wireless networks with unknown system dynamics. Recent advancements include ensemble multi-environment hybrid Q-learning algorithms, which utilize multiple Q-learning algorithms across structurally related but distinct Markovian environments and outperform existing Q-learning algorithms in terms of accuracy and complexity in large-scale wireless networks. We herein conduct a comprehensive coverage analysis to ensure optimal data coverage conditions for these algorithms. Initially, we establish upper bounds on the expectation and variance of different coverage coefficients. Leveraging these bounds, we present an algorithm for efficient initialization of these algorithms. We test our algorithm on two distinct real-world wireless networks. Numerical simulations show that our algorithm can achieve %50 less policy error and %40 less runtime complexity than state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms. Furthermore, our algorithm exhibits robustness to changes in network settings and parameters. We also numerically validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>LLaVA-Chef: A Multi-modal Generative Model for Food Recipes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of online recipe sharing within a globalized context, there has been a notable surge in research towards comprehending and generating food recipes. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-2 and LLaVA have paved the way for Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches to delve deeper into various facets of food-related tasks, encompassing ingredient recognition and comprehensive recipe generation. Despite impressive performance and multi-modal adaptability of LLMs, domain-specific training remains paramount for their effective application. This work evaluates existing LLMs for recipe generation and proposes LLaVA-Chef, a novel model trained on a curated dataset of diverse recipe prompts in a multi-stage approach. First, we refine the mapping of visual food image embeddings to the language space. Second, we adapt LLaVA to the food domain by fine-tuning it on relevant recipe data. Third, we utilize diverse prompts to enhance the model's recipe comprehension. Finally, we improve the linguistic quality of generated recipes by penalizing the model with a custom loss function. LLaVA-Chef demonstrates impressive improvements over pretrained LLMs and prior works. A detailed qualitative analysis reveals that LLaVA-Chef generates more detailed recipes with precise ingredient mentions, compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Robotic warehousing operations: a learn-then-optimize approach to large-scale neighborhood search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid deployment of robotics technologies requires dedicated optimization algorithms to manage large fleets of autonomous agents. This paper supports robotic parts-to-picker operations in warehousing by optimizing order-workstation assignments, item-pod assignments and the schedule of order fulfillment at workstations. The model maximizes throughput, while managing human workload at the workstations and congestion in the facility. We solve it via large-scale neighborhood search, with a novel learn-then-optimize approach to subproblem generation. The algorithm relies on an offline machine learning procedure to predict objective improvements based on subproblem features, and an online optimization model to generate a new subproblem at each iteration. In collaboration with Amazon Robotics, we show that our model and algorithm generate much stronger solutions for practical problems than state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, our solution enhances the utilization of robotic fleets by coordinating robotic tasks for human operators to pick multiple items at once, and by coordinating robotic routes to avoid congestion in the facility.</description>

      <title>Tex-ViT: A Generalizable, Robust, Texture-based dual-branch cross-attention deepfake detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deepfakes, which employ GAN to produce highly realistic facial modification, are widely regarded as the prevailing method. Traditional CNN have been able to identify bogus media, but they struggle to perform well on different datasets and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to their lack of robustness. Vision transformers have demonstrated potential in the realm of image classification problems, but they require enough training data. Motivated by these limitations, this publication introduces Tex-ViT (Texture-Vision Transformer), which enhances CNN features by combining ResNet with a vision transformer. The model combines traditional ResNet features with a texture module that operates in parallel on sections of ResNet before each down-sampling operation. The texture module then serves as an input to the dual branch of the cross-attention vision transformer. It specifically focuses on improving the global texture module, which extracts feature map correlation. Empirical analysis reveals that fake images exhibit smooth textures that do not remain consistent over long distances in manipulations. Experiments were performed on different categories of FF++, such as DF, f2f, FS, and NT, together with other types of GAN datasets in cross-domain scenarios. Furthermore, experiments also conducted on FF++, DFDCPreview, and Celeb-DF dataset underwent several post-processing situations, such as blurring, compression, and noise. The model surpassed the most advanced models in terms of generalization, achieving a 98% accuracy in cross-domain scenarios. This demonstrates its ability to learn the shared distinguishing textural characteristics in the manipulated samples. These experiments provide evidence that the proposed model is capable of being applied to various situations and is resistant to many post-processing procedures.</description>

      <title>Exploring Multiple Strategies to Improve Multilingual Coreference Resolution in CorefUD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coreference resolution, the task of identifying expressions in text that refer to the same entity, is a critical component in various natural language processing (NLP) applications. This paper presents our end-to-end neural coreference resolution system, utilizing the CorefUD 1.1 dataset, which spans 17 datasets across 12 languages. We first establish strong baseline models, including monolingual and cross-lingual variations, and then propose several extensions to enhance performance across diverse linguistic contexts. These extensions include cross-lingual training, incorporation of syntactic information, a Span2Head model for optimized headword prediction, and advanced singleton modeling. We also experiment with headword span representation and long-documents modeling through overlapping segments. The proposed extensions, particularly the heads-only approach, singleton modeling, and long document prediction significantly improve performance across most datasets. We also perform zero-shot cross-lingual experiments, highlighting the potential and limitations of cross-lingual transfer in coreference resolution. Our findings contribute to the development of robust and scalable coreference systems for multilingual coreference resolution. Finally, we evaluate our model on CorefUD 1.1 test set and surpass the best model from CRAC 2023 shared task of a comparable size by a large margin.

      <title>AI-driven Reverse Engineering of QML Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a rapidly emerging area of research, driven by the capabilities of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. With the progress in the research of QML models, there is a rise in third-party quantum cloud services to cater to the increasing demand for resources. New security concerns surface, specifically regarding the protection of intellectual property (IP) from untrustworthy service providers. One of the most pressing risks is the potential for reverse engineering (RE) by malicious actors who may steal proprietary quantum IPs such as trained parameters and QML architecture, modify them to remove additional watermarks or signatures and re-transpile them for other quantum hardware. Prior work presents a brute force approach to RE the QML parameters which takes exponential time overhead. In this paper, we introduce an autoencoder-based approach to extract the parameters from transpiled QML models deployed on untrusted third-party vendors. We experiment on multi-qubit classifiers and note that they can be reverse-engineered under restricted conditions with a mean error of order 10^-1. The amount of time taken to prepare the dataset and train the model to reverse engineer the QML circuit being of the order 10^3 seconds (which is 10^2x better than the previously reported value for 4-layered 4-qubit classifiers) makes the threat of RE highly potent, underscoring the need for continued development of effective defenses.</description>

      <title>Efficient Transonic Aeroelastic Model Reduction Using Optimized Sparse Multi-Input Polynomial Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear aeroelastic reduced-order models (ROMs) based on machine learning or artificial intelligence algorithms can be complex and computationally demanding to train, meaning that for practical aeroelastic applications, the conservative nature of linearization is often favored. Therefore, there is a requirement for novel nonlinear aeroelastic model reduction approaches that are accurate, simple and, most importantly, efficient to generate. This paper proposes a novel formulation for the identification of a compact multi-input Volterra series, where Orthogonal Matching Pursuit is used to obtain a set of optimally sparse nonlinear multi-input ROM coefficients from unsteady aerodynamic training data. The framework is exemplified using the Benchmark Supercritical Wing, considering; forced response, flutter and limit cycle oscillation. The simple and efficient Optimal Sparsity Multi-Input ROM (OSM-ROM) framework performs with high accuracy compared to the full-order aeroelastic model, requiring only a fraction of the tens-of-thousands of possible multi-input terms to be identified and allowing a 96% reduction in the number of training samples.</description>

      <title>FlowRetrieval: Flow-Guided Data Retrieval for Few-Shot Imitation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-shot imitation learning relies on only a small amount of task-specific demonstrations to efficiently adapt a policy for a given downstream tasks. Retrieval-based methods come with a promise of retrieving relevant past experiences to augment this target data when learning policies. However, existing data retrieval methods fall under two extremes: they either rely on the existence of exact behaviors with visually similar scenes in the prior data, which is impractical to assume; or they retrieve based on semantic similarity of high-level language descriptions of the task, which might not be that informative about the shared low-level behaviors or motions across tasks that is often a more important factor for retrieving relevant data for policy learning. In this work, we investigate how we can leverage motion similarity in the vast amount of cross-task data to improve few-shot imitation learning of the target task. Our key insight is that motion-similar data carries rich information about the effects of actions and object interactions that can be leveraged during few-shot adaptation. We propose FlowRetrieval, an approach that leverages optical flow representations for both extracting similar motions to target tasks from prior data, and for guiding learning of a policy that can maximally benefit from such data. Our results show FlowRetrieval significantly outperforms prior methods across simulated and real-world domains, achieving on average 27% higher success rate than the best retrieval-based prior method. In the Pen-in-Cup task with a real Franka Emika robot, FlowRetrieval achieves 3.7x the performance of the baseline imitation learning technique that learns from all prior and target data.

      <title>Different Victims, Same Layout: Email Visual Similarity Detection for Enhanced Email Protection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of an effective spam detection system, the focus has often been on identifying known spam patterns either through rule-based detection systems or machine learning (ML) solutions. However, both systems are susceptible to evasion techniques and zero-day attacks that can be achieved at low cost. Therefore, an email that bypassed the defense system once can do it again in the following days, even though rules are updated or the ML models are retrained. The recurrence of failures to detect emails that exhibit layout similarities to previously undetected spam is concerning for customers and can erode their trust in a company. Our observations show that threat actors reuse email kits extensively and can bypass detection with little effort, for example, by making changes to the content of emails. In this work, we propose an email visual similarity detection approach, named Pisco, to improve the detection capabilities of an email threat defense system. We apply our proof of concept to some real-world samples received from different sources. Our results show that email kits are being reused extensively and visually similar emails are sent to our customers at various time intervals. Therefore, this method could be very helpful in situations where detection features that rely on contextual information and keywords are bypassed, an occurrence our observations show happens frequently.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AlphaFold series has transformed protein structure prediction with remarkable accuracy, often matching experimental methods. AlphaFold2, AlphaFold-Multimer, and the latest AlphaFold3 represent significant strides in predicting single protein chains, protein complexes, and biomolecular structures. While AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold-Multimer are open-sourced, facilitating rapid and reliable predictions, AlphaFold3 remains partially accessible through a limited online server and has not been open-sourced, restricting further development. To address these challenges, the PaddleHelix team is developing HelixFold3, aiming to replicate AlphaFold3's capabilities. Using insights from previous models and extensive datasets, HelixFold3 achieves an accuracy comparable to AlphaFold3 in predicting the structures of conventional ligands, nucleic acids, and proteins. The initial release of HelixFold3 is available as open source on GitHub for academic research, promising to advance biomolecular research and accelerate discoveries. We also provide online service at PaddleHelix website at https://paddlehelix.baidu.com/app/all/helixfold3/forecast.</description>

      <title>Training Ultra Long Context Language Model with Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with long context capabilities are integral to complex tasks in natural language processing and computational biology, such as text generation and protein sequence analysis. However, training LLMs directly on extremely long contexts demands considerable GPU resources and increased memory, leading to higher costs and greater complexity. Alternative approaches that introduce long context capabilities via downstream finetuning or adaptations impose significant design limitations. In this paper, we propose Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer (FPDT) for efficiently training long-context LLMs with extreme hardware efficiency. For GPT and Llama models, we achieve a 16x increase in sequence length that can be trained on the same hardware compared to current state-of-the-art solutions. With our dedicated sequence chunk pipeline design, we can now train 8B LLM with 2 million sequence length on only 4 GPUs, while also maintaining over 55% of MFU. Our proposed FPDT is agnostic to existing training techniques and is proven to work efficiently across different LLM models.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Table Representations to Answer Questions from Tables in Documents : A Case Study using 3GPP Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the ubiquitous use of document corpora for question answering, one important aspect which is especially relevant for technical documents is the ability to extract information from tables which are interspersed with text. The major challenge in this is that unlike free-flow text or isolated set of tables, the representation of a table in terms of what is a relevant chunk is not obvious. We conduct a series of experiments examining various representations of tabular data interspersed with text to understand the relative benefits of different representations. We choose a corpus of $3^{rd}$ Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) documents since they are heavily interspersed with tables. We create expert curated dataset of question answers to evaluate our approach. We conclude that row level representations with corresponding table header information being included in every cell improves the performance of the retrieval, thus leveraging the structural information present in the tabular data.</description>

      <title>Disease Classification and Impact of Pretrained Deep Convolution Neural Networks on Diverse Medical Imaging Datasets across Imaging Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging techniques such as Chest X-rays, whole slide images, and optical coherence tomography serve as the initial screening and detection for a wide variety of medical pulmonary and ophthalmic conditions respectively. This paper investigates the intricacies of using pretrained deep convolutional neural networks with transfer learning across diverse medical imaging datasets with varying modalities for binary and multiclass classification. We conducted a comprehensive performance analysis with ten network architectures and model families each with pretraining and random initialization. Our finding showed that the use of pretrained models as fixed feature extractors yields poor performance irrespective of the datasets. Contrary, histopathology microscopy whole slide images have better performance. It is also found that deeper and more complex architectures did not necessarily result in the best performance. This observation implies that the improvements in ImageNet are not parallel to the medical imaging tasks. Within a medical domain, the performance of the network architectures varies within model families with shifts in datasets. This indicates that the performance of models within a specific modality may not be conclusive for another modality within the same domain. This study provides a deeper understanding of the applications of deep learning techniques in medical imaging and highlights the impact of pretrained networks across different medical imaging datasets under five different experimental settings.</description>

      <title>A Survey of the Self Supervised Learning Mechanisms for Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep supervised learning models require high volume of labeled data to attain sufficiently good results. Although, the practice of gathering and annotating such big data is costly and laborious. Recently, the application of self supervised learning (SSL) in vision tasks has gained significant attention. The intuition behind SSL is to exploit the synchronous relationships within the data as a form of self-supervision, which can be versatile. In the current big data era, most of the data is unlabeled, and the success of SSL thus relies in finding ways to improve this vast amount of unlabeled data available. Thus its better for deep learning algorithms to reduce reliance on human supervision and instead focus on self-supervision based on the inherent relationships within the data. With the advent of ViTs, which have achieved remarkable results in computer vision, it is crucial to explore and understand the various SSL mechanisms employed for training these models specifically in scenarios where there is less label data available. In this survey we thus develop a comprehensive taxonomy of systematically classifying the SSL techniques based upon their representations and pre-training tasks being applied. Additionally, we discuss the motivations behind SSL, review popular pre-training tasks, and highlight the challenges and advancements in this field. Furthermore, we present a comparative analysis of different SSL methods, evaluate their strengths and limitations, and identify potential avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Instant Adversarial Purification with Adversarial Consistency Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks, despite their remarkable performance in widespread applications, including image classification, are also known to be vulnerable to subtle adversarial noise. Although some diffusion-based purification methods have been proposed, for example, DiffPure, those methods are time-consuming. In this paper, we propose One Step Control Purification (OSCP), a diffusion-based purification model that can purify the adversarial image in one Neural Function Evaluation (NFE) in diffusion models. We use Latent Consistency Model (LCM) and ControlNet for our one-step purification. OSCP is computationally friendly and time efficient compared to other diffusion-based purification methods; we achieve defense success rate of 74.19\% on ImageNet, only requiring 0.1s for each purification. Moreover, there is a fundamental incongruence between consistency distillation and adversarial perturbation. To address this ontological dissonance, we propose Gaussian Adversarial Noise Distillation (GAND), a novel consistency distillation framework that facilitates a more nuanced reconciliation of the latent space dynamics, effectively bridging the natural and adversarial manifolds. Our experiments show that the GAND does not need a Full Fine Tune (FFT); PEFT, e.g., LoRA is sufficient.</description>

      <title>RISSOLE: Parameter-efficient Diffusion Models via Block-wise Generation and Retrieval-Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based models demonstrate impressive generation capabilities. However, they also have a massive number of parameters, resulting in enormous model sizes, thus making them unsuitable for deployment on resource-constraint devices. Block-wise generation can be a promising alternative for designing compact-sized (parameter-efficient) deep generative models since the model can generate one block at a time instead of generating the whole image at once. However, block-wise generation is also considerably challenging because ensuring coherence across generated blocks can be non-trivial. To this end, we design a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach and leverage the corresponding blocks of the images retrieved by the RAG module to condition the training and generation stages of a block-wise denoising diffusion model. Our conditioning schemes ensure coherence across the different blocks during training and, consequently, during generation. While we showcase our approach using the latent diffusion model (LDM) as the base model, it can be used with other variants of denoising diffusion models. We validate the solution of the coherence problem through the proposed approach by reporting substantive experiments to demonstrate our approach's effectiveness in compact model size and excellent generation quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates privacy leakage in dimensionality reduction methods through a novel machine learning-based reconstruction attack. Employing an \emph{informed adversary} threat model, we develop a neural network capable of reconstructing high-dimensional data from low-dimensional embeddings.
  We evaluate six popular dimensionality reduction techniques: PCA, sparse random projection (SRP), multidimensional scaling (MDS), Isomap, $t$-SNE, and UMAP. Using both MNIST and NIH Chest X-ray datasets, we perform a qualitative analysis to identify key factors affecting reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we assess the effectiveness of an additive noise mechanism in mitigating these reconstruction attacks.</description>

      <title>Learning Multi-Target TDOA Features for Sound Event Localization and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sound event localization and detection (SELD) systems using audio recordings from a microphone array rely on spatial cues for determining the location of sound events. As a consequence, the localization performance of such systems is to a large extent determined by the quality of the audio features that are used as inputs to the system. We propose a new feature, based on neural generalized cross-correlations with phase-transform (NGCC-PHAT), that learns audio representations suitable for localization. Using permutation invariant training for the time-difference of arrival (TDOA) estimation problem enables NGCC-PHAT to learn TDOA features for multiple overlapping sound events. These features can be used as a drop-in replacement for GCC-PHAT inputs to a SELD-network. We test our method on the STARSS23 dataset and demonstrate improved localization performance compared to using standard GCC-PHAT or SALSA-Lite input features.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Clustering Counter Relationships of Team Compositions in PvP Games for Efficient Balance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can balance be quantified in game settings? This question is crucial for game designers, especially in player-versus-player (PvP) games, where analyzing the strength relations among predefined team compositions-such as hero combinations in multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games or decks in card games-is essential for enhancing gameplay and achieving balance. We have developed two advanced measures that extend beyond the simplistic win rate to quantify balance in zero-sum competitive scenarios. These measures are derived from win value estimations, which employ strength rating approximations via the Bradley-Terry model and counter relationship approximations via vector quantization, significantly reducing the computational complexity associated with traditional win value estimations. Throughout the learning process of these models, we identify useful categories of compositions and pinpoint their counter relationships, aligning with the experiences of human players without requiring specific game knowledge. Our methodology hinges on a simple technique to enhance codebook utilization in discrete representation with a deterministic vector quantization process for an extremely small state space. Our framework has been validated in popular online games, including Age of Empires II, Hearthstone, Brawl Stars, and League of Legends. The accuracy of the observed strength relations in these games is comparable to traditional pairwise win value predictions, while also offering a more manageable complexity for analysis. Ultimately, our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of PvP game dynamics and present a methodology that significantly improves game balance evaluation and design.</description>

      <title>Towards Symbolic XAI -- Explanation Through Human Understandable Logical Relationships Between Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) plays a crucial role in fostering transparency and trust in AI systems, where traditional XAI approaches typically offer one level of abstraction for explanations, often in the form of heatmaps highlighting single or multiple input features. However, we ask whether abstract reasoning or problem-solving strategies of a model may also be relevant, as these align more closely with how humans approach solutions to problems. We propose a framework, called Symbolic XAI, that attributes relevance to symbolic queries expressing logical relationships between input features, thereby capturing the abstract reasoning behind a model's predictions. The methodology is built upon a simple yet general multi-order decomposition of model predictions. This decomposition can be specified using higher-order propagation-based relevance methods, such as GNN-LRP, or perturbation-based explanation methods commonly used in XAI. The effectiveness of our framework is demonstrated in the domains of natural language processing (NLP), vision, and quantum chemistry (QC), where abstract symbolic domain knowledge is abundant and of significant interest to users. The Symbolic XAI framework provides an understanding of the model's decision-making process that is both flexible for customization by the user and human-readable through logical formulas.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) on the ROAD dataset: A Comparative Analysis for automotive Controller Area Network (CAN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of digital devices in modern vehicles has revolutionized automotive technology, enhancing safety and the overall driving experience. The Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is a central system for managing in-vehicle communication between the electronic control units (ECUs). However, the CAN protocol poses security challenges due to inherent vulnerabilities, lacking encryption and authentication, which, combined with an expanding attack surface, necessitates robust security measures. In response to this challenge, numerous Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been developed and deployed. Nonetheless, an open, comprehensive, and realistic dataset to test the effectiveness of such IDSs remains absent in the existing literature. This paper addresses this gap by considering the latest ROAD dataset, containing stealthy and sophisticated injections. The methodology involves dataset labelling and the implementation of both state-of-the-art deep learning models and traditional machine learning models to show the discrepancy in performance between the datasets most commonly used in the literature and the ROAD dataset, a more realistic alternative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning algorithms, such as those used in Reinforcement Learning, often require large quantities of data to train effectively. In most cases, the availability of data is not a significant issue. However, for some contexts, such as in autonomous cyber defence, we require data efficient methods. Recently, Quantum Machine Learning and Boltzmann Machines have been proposed as solutions to this challenge. In this work we build upon the pre-existing work to extend the use of Deep Boltzmann Machines to the cutting edge algorithm Proximal Policy Optimisation in a Reinforcement Learning cyber defence environment. We show that this approach, when solved using a D-WAVE quantum annealer, can lead to a two-fold increase in data efficiency. We therefore expect it to be used by the machine learning and quantum communities who are hoping to capitalise on data-efficient Reinforcement Learning methods.</description>

      <title>Learning and Verifying Maximal Taylor-Neural Lyapunov functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel neural network architecture, termed Taylor-neural Lyapunov functions, designed to approximate Lyapunov functions with formal certification. This architecture innovatively encodes local approximations and extends them globally by leveraging neural networks to approximate the residuals. Our method recasts the problem of estimating the largest region of attraction - specifically for maximal Lyapunov functions - into a learning problem, ensuring convergence around the origin through robust control theory. Physics-informed machine learning techniques further refine the estimation of the largest region of attraction. Remarkably, this method is versatile, operating effectively even without simulated data points. We validate the efficacy of our approach by providing numerical certificates of convergence across multiple examples. Our proposed methodology not only competes closely with state-of-the-art approaches, such as sum-of-squares and LyZNet, but also achieves comparable results even in the absence of simulated data. This work represents a significant advancement in control theory, with broad potential applications in the design of stable control systems and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific machine learning (SciML) methods such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are used to estimate parameters of interest from governing equations and small quantities of data. However, there has been little work in assessing how well PINNs perform for inverse problems across wide ranges of governing equations across the mathematical sciences. We present a new and challenging benchmark problem for inverse PINNs based on a parametric sweep of the 2D Burgers' equation with rotational flow. We show that a novel strategy that alternates between first- and second-order optimization proves superior to typical first-order strategies for estimating parameters. In addition, we propose a novel data-driven method to characterize PINN effectiveness in the inverse setting. PINNs' physics-informed regularization enables them to leverage small quantities of data more efficiently than the data-driven baseline. However, both PINNs and the baseline can fail to recover parameters for highly inviscid flows, motivating the need for further development of PINN methods.</description>

      <title>Minimax and Communication-Efficient Distributed Best Subset Selection with Oracle Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explosion of large-scale data in fields such as finance, e-commerce, and social media has outstripped the processing capabilities of single-machine systems, driving the need for distributed statistical inference methods. Traditional approaches to distributed inference often struggle with achieving true sparsity in high-dimensional datasets and involve high computational costs. We propose a novel, two-stage, distributed best subset selection algorithm to address these issues. Our approach starts by efficiently estimating the active set while adhering to the $\ell_0$ norm-constrained surrogate likelihood function, effectively reducing dimensionality and isolating key variables. A refined estimation within the active set follows, ensuring sparse estimates and matching the minimax $\ell_2$ error bound. We introduce a new splicing technique for adaptive parameter selection to tackle subproblems under $\ell_0$ constraints and a Generalized Information Criterion (GIC). Our theoretical and numerical studies show that the proposed algorithm correctly finds the true sparsity pattern, has the oracle property, and greatly lowers communication costs. This is a big step forward in distributed sparse estimation.</description>

      <title>Image-Perfect Imperfections: Safety, Bias, and Authenticity in the Shadow of Text-To-Image Model Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), undergo iterative updates to improve image quality and address concerns such as safety. Improvements in image quality are straightforward to assess. However, how model updates resolve existing concerns and whether they raise new questions remain unexplored. This study takes an initial step in investigating the evolution of text-to-image models from the perspectives of safety, bias, and authenticity. Our findings, centered on Stable Diffusion, indicate that model updates paint a mixed picture. While updates progressively reduce the generation of unsafe images, the bias issue, particularly in gender, intensifies. We also find that negative stereotypes either persist within the same Non-White race group or shift towards other Non-White race groups through SD updates, yet with minimal association of these traits with the White race group. Additionally, our evaluation reveals a new concern stemming from SD updates: State-of-the-art fake image detectors, initially trained for earlier SD versions, struggle to identify fake images generated by updated versions. We show that fine-tuning these detectors on fake images generated by updated versions achieves at least 96.6\% accuracy across various SD versions, addressing this issue. Our insights highlight the importance of continued efforts to mitigate biases and vulnerabilities in evolving text-to-image models.</description>

Abstract: Simulating mantle convection often requires reaching a computationally expensive steady-state, crucial for deriving scaling laws for thermal and dynamical flow properties and benchmarking numerical solutions. The strong temperature dependence of the rheology of mantle rocks causes viscosity variations of several orders of magnitude, leading to a slow-evolving stagnant lid where heat conduction dominates, overlying a rapidly-evolving and strongly convecting region. Time-stepping methods, while effective for fluids with constant viscosity, are hindered by the Courant criterion, which restricts the time step based on the system's maximum velocity and grid size. Consequently, achieving steady-state requires a large number of time steps due to the disparate time scales governing the stagnant and convecting regions.
  We present a concept for accelerating mantle convection simulations using machine learning. We generate a dataset of 128 two-dimensional simulations with mixed basal and internal heating, and pressure- and temperature-dependent viscosity. We train a feedforward neural network on 97 simulations to predict steady-state temperature profiles. These can then be used to initialize numerical time stepping methods for different simulation parameters. Compared to typical initializations, the number of time steps required to reach steady-state is reduced by a median factor of 3.75. The benefit of this method lies in requiring very few simulations to train on, providing a solution with no prediction error as we initialize a numerical method, and posing minimal computational overhead at inference time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and discuss the potential implications for accelerated simulations for advancing mantle convection research.</description>

Abstract: In the realm of cyber-security, detecting Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) remains a formidable challenge due to their stealthy and sophisticated nature. This research paper presents an innovative approach that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a 2D baseline model, enhanced by the cutting-edge Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) algorithm, to significantly improve APT detection accuracy. By seamlessly integrating the 2D-CNN baseline model with CSO, we unlock the potential for unprecedented accuracy and efficiency in APT detection.

      <title>Estimation of Cardiac and Non-cardiac Diagnosis from Electrocardiogram Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introduction: Ensuring timely and accurate diagnosis of medical conditions is paramount for effective patient care. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are fundamental for evaluating a patient's cardiac health and are readily available. Despite this, little attention has been given to the remarkable potential of ECG data in detecting non-cardiac conditions.
  Methods: In our study, we used publicly available datasets (MIMIC-IV-ECG-ICD and ECG-VIEW II) to investigate the feasibility of inferring general diagnostic conditions from ECG features. To this end, we trained a tree-based model (XGBoost) based on ECG features and basic demographic features to estimate a wide range of diagnoses, encompassing both cardiac and non-cardiac conditions.
  Results: Our results demonstrate the reliability of estimating 23 cardiac as well as 21 non-cardiac conditions above 0.7 AUROC in a statistically significant manner across a wide range of physiological categories. Our findings underscore the predictive potential of ECG data in identifying well-known cardiac conditions. However, even more striking, this research represents a pioneering effort in systematically expanding the scope of ECG-based diagnosis to conditions not traditionally associated with the cardiac system.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Reliability in Medical DNNs: A Critical Analysis of Feature and Confidence-Based OOD Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for medical image analysis requires methods to identify inputs that differ significantly from the training data, called out-of-distribution (OOD), to prevent erroneous predictions. OOD detection methods can be categorised as either confidence-based (using the model's output layer for OOD detection) or feature-based (not using the output layer). We created two new OOD benchmarks by dividing the D7P (dermatology) and BreastMNIST (ultrasound) datasets into subsets which either contain or don't contain an artefact (rulers or annotations respectively). Models were trained with artefact-free images, and images with the artefacts were used as OOD test sets. For each OOD image, we created a counterfactual by manually removing the artefact via image processing, to assess the artefact's impact on the model's predictions. We show that OOD artefacts can boost a model's softmax confidence in its predictions, due to correlations in training data among other factors. This contradicts the common assumption that OOD artefacts should lead to more uncertain outputs, an assumption on which most confidence-based methods rely. We use this to explain why feature-based methods (e.g. Mahalanobis score) typically have greater OOD detection performance than confidence-based methods (e.g. MCP). However, we also show that feature-based methods typically perform worse at distinguishing between inputs that lead to correct and incorrect predictions (for both OOD and ID data). Following from these insights, we argue that a combination of feature-based and confidence-based methods should be used within DNN pipelines to mitigate their respective weaknesses. These project's code and OOD benchmarks are available at: https://github.com/HarryAnthony/Evaluating_OOD_detection.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Decoding: Improving Action Chunking via Closed-Loop Resampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting and executing a sequence of actions without intermediate replanning, known as action chunking, is increasingly used in robot learning from human demonstrations. However, its effects on learned policies remain puzzling: some studies highlight its importance for achieving strong performance, while others observe detrimental effects. In this paper, we first dissect the role of action chunking by analyzing the divergence between the learner and the demonstrator. We find that longer action chunks enable a policy to better capture temporal dependencies by taking into account more past states and actions within the chunk. However, this advantage comes at the cost of exacerbating errors in stochastic environments due to fewer observations of recent states. To address this, we propose Bidirectional Decoding (BID), a test-time inference algorithm that bridges action chunking with closed-loop operations. BID samples multiple predictions at each time step and searches for the optimal one based on two criteria: (i) backward coherence, which favors samples aligned with previous decisions, (ii) forward contrast, which favors samples close to outputs of a stronger policy and distant from those of a weaker policy. By coupling decisions within and across action chunks, BID enhances temporal consistency over extended sequences while enabling adaptive replanning in stochastic environments. Experimental results show that BID substantially outperforms conventional closed-loop operations of two state-of-the-art generative policies across seven simulation benchmarks and two real-world tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional layers with 1-D filters are often used as frontend to encode audio signals. Unlike fixed time-frequency representations, they can adapt to the local characteristics of input data. However, 1-D filters on raw audio are hard to train and often suffer from instabilities. In this paper, we address these problems with hybrid solutions, i.e., combining theory-driven and data-driven approaches. First, we preprocess the audio signals via a auditory filterbank, guaranteeing good frequency localization for the learned encoder. Second, we use results from frame theory to define an unsupervised learning objective that encourages energy conservation and perfect reconstruction. Third, we adapt mixed compressed spectral norms as learning objectives to the encoder coefficients. Using these solutions in a low-complexity encoder-mask-decoder model significantly improves the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) in speech enhancement.</description>

      <title>Traffic expertise meets residual RL: Knowledge-informed model-based residual reinforcement learning for CAV trajectory control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) is anticipated to exhibit higher sample efficiency compared to model-free RL by utilizing a virtual environment model. However, it is challenging to obtain sufficiently accurate representations of the environmental dynamics due to uncertainties in complex systems and environments. An inaccurate environment model may degrade the sample efficiency and performance of model-based RL. Furthermore, while model-based RL can improve sample efficiency, it often still requires substantial training time to learn from scratch, potentially limiting its advantages over model-free approaches. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a knowledge-informed model-based residual reinforcement learning framework aimed at enhancing learning efficiency by infusing established expert knowledge into the learning process and avoiding the issue of beginning from zero. Our approach integrates traffic expert knowledge into a virtual environment model, employing the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for basic dynamics and neural networks for residual dynamics, thus ensuring adaptability to complex scenarios. We propose a novel strategy that combines traditional control methods with residual RL, facilitating efficient learning and policy optimization without the need to learn from scratch. The proposed approach is applied to CAV trajectory control tasks for the dissipation of stop-and-go waves in mixed traffic flow. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach enables the CAV agent to achieve superior performance in trajectory control compared to the baseline agents in terms of sample efficiency, traffic flow smoothness and traffic mobility.

      <title>Bayesian Optimization for Non-Convex Two-Stage Stochastic Optimization Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a sample-efficient method for solving expensive, black-box optimization problems. Stochastic programming concerns optimization under uncertainty where, typically, average performance is the quantity of interest. In the first stage of a two-stage problem, here-and-now decisions must be made in the face of this uncertainty, while in the second stage, wait-and-see decisions are made after the uncertainty has been resolved. Many methods in stochastic programming assume that the objective is cheap to evaluate and linear or convex. In this work, we apply Bayesian optimization to solve non-convex, two-stage stochastic programs which are expensive to evaluate. We formulate a knowledge-gradient-based acquisition function to jointly optimize the first- and second-stage variables, establish a guarantee of asymptotic consistency and provide a computationally efficient approximation. We demonstrate comparable empirical results to an alternative we formulate which alternates its focus between the two variable types, and superior empirical results over the standard, naive, two-step benchmark. We show that differences in the dimension and length scales between the variable types can lead to inefficiencies of the two-step algorithm, while the joint and alternating acquisition functions perform well in all problems tested. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthesizing the voices of unseen speakers is a persisting challenge in multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS). Most multi-speaker TTS models rely on modeling speaker characteristics through speaker conditioning during training. Modeling unseen speaker attributes through this approach has necessitated an increase in model complexity, which makes it challenging to reproduce results and improve upon them. We design a simple alternative to this. We propose SelectTTS, a novel method to select the appropriate frames from the target speaker and decode using frame-level self-supervised learning (SSL) features. We show that this approach can effectively capture speaker characteristics for unseen speakers, and achieves comparable results to other multi-speaker TTS frameworks in both objective and subjective metrics. With SelectTTS, we show that frame selection from the target speaker's speech is a direct way to achieve generalization in unseen speakers with low model complexity. We achieve better speaker similarity performance than SOTA baselines XTTS-v2 and VALL-E with over an 8x reduction in model parameters and a 270x reduction in training data</description>

      <title>On the Curse of Memory in Recurrent Neural Networks: Approximation and Optimization Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.07799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the approximation properties and optimization dynamics of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) when applied to learn input-output relationships in temporal data. We consider the simple but representative setting of using continuous-time linear RNNs to learn from data generated by linear relationships. Mathematically, the latter can be understood as a sequence of linear functionals. We prove a universal approximation theorem of such linear functionals, and characterize the approximation rate and its relation with memory. Moreover, we perform a fine-grained dynamical analysis of training linear RNNs, which further reveal the intricate interactions between memory and learning. A unifying theme uncovered is the non-trivial effect of memory, a notion that can be made precise in our framework, on approximation and optimization: when there is long term memory in the target, it takes a large number of neurons to approximate it. Moreover, the training process will suffer from slow downs. In particular, both of these effects become exponentially more pronounced with memory - a phenomenon we call the "curse of memory". These analyses represent a basic step towards a concrete mathematical understanding of new phenomenon that may arise in learning temporal relationships using recurrent architectures.</description>

      <title>Attribute Graphs Underlying Molecular Generative Models: Path to Learning with Limited Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.07174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training generative models that capture rich semantics of the data and interpreting the latent representations encoded by such models are very important problems in un-/self-supervised learning. In this work, we provide a simple algorithm that relies on perturbation experiments on latent codes of a pre-trained generative autoencoder to uncover an attribute graph that is implied by the generative model. We perform perturbation experiments to check for influence of a given latent variable on a subset of attributes. Given this, we show that one can fit an effective graphical model that models a structural equation model between latent codes taken as exogenous variables and attributes taken as observed variables. One interesting aspect is that a single latent variable controls multiple overlapping subsets of attributes unlike conventional approaches that try to impose full independence. Using a pre-trained generative autoencoder trained on a large dataset of small molecules, we demonstrate that the graphical model between various molecular attributes and latent codes learned by our algorithm can be used to predict a specific property for molecules which are drawn from a different distribution. We compare prediction models trained on various feature subsets chosen by simple baselines, as well as existing causal discovery and sparse learning/feature selection methods, with the ones in the derived Markov blanket from our method. Results show empirically that the predictor that relies on our Markov blanket attributes is robust to distribution shifts when transferred or fine-tuned with a few samples from the new distribution, especially when training data is limited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When data is generated by multiple sources, conventional training methods update models assuming equal reliability for each source and do not consider their individual data quality during training. However, in many applications, sources have varied levels of reliability that can have negative effects on the performance of a neural network. A key issue is that often the quality of data for individual sources is not known during training. Focusing on supervised learning, this work presents a solution that aims to train neural networks on each data source for a number of steps proportional to the source's estimated relative reliability. This way, we allow training on all sources during the warm-up, and reduce learning on less reliable sources during the final training stages, when it has been shown models overfit to noise. We show through diverse experiments, this can significantly improve model performance when trained on mixtures of reliable and unreliable data sources, and maintain performance when models are trained on reliable sources only.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Warehouse Logistics with Robotic and Human Co-Workers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a warehouse in which dozens of mobile robots and human pickers work together to collect and deliver items within the warehouse. The fundamental problem we tackle, called the order-picking problem, is how these worker agents must coordinate their movement and actions in the warehouse to maximise performance in this task. Established industry methods using heuristic approaches require large engineering efforts to optimise for innately variable warehouse configurations. In contrast, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) can be flexibly applied to diverse warehouse configurations (e.g. size, layout, number/types of workers, item replenishment frequency), and different types of order-picking paradigms (e.g. Goods-to-Person and Person-to-Goods), as the agents can learn how to cooperate optimally through experience. We develop hierarchical MARL algorithms in which a manager agent assigns goals to worker agents, and the policies of the manager and workers are co-trained toward maximising a global objective (e.g. pick rate). Our hierarchical algorithms achieve significant gains in sample efficiency over baseline MARL algorithms and overall pick rates over multiple established industry heuristics in a diverse set of warehouse configurations and different order-picking paradigms.</description>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a crucial distributed training paradigm, enabling discrete devices to collaboratively train a shared model under the coordination of a central server, while leveraging their locally stored private data. Nonetheless, the non-independent-and-identically-distributed (Non-IID) data generated on heterogeneous clients and the incessant information exchange among participants may significantly impede training efficacy, retard the model convergence rate and increase the risk of privacy leakage. To alleviate the divergence between the local and average model parameters and obtain a fast model convergence rate, we propose an adaptive FEDerated learning algorithm called FedAgg by refining the conventional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methodology with an AGgregated Gradient term at each local training epoch and adaptively adjusting the learning rate based on a penalty term that quantifies the local model deviation. To tackle the challenge of information exchange among clients during local training and design a decentralized adaptive learning rate for each client, we introduce two mean-field terms to approximate the average local parameters and gradients over time. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the existence and convergence of the mean-field terms and provide a robust upper bound on the convergence of our proposed algorithm. The extensive experimental results on real-world datasets substantiate the superiority of our framework in comparison with existing state-of-the-art FL strategies for enhancing model performance and accelerating convergence rate under IID and Non-IID datasets.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Unlabelled Data into Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) are unable to leverage unlabelled data to improve their predictions. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Self-Supervised Bayesian Neural Networks, which use unlabelled data to learn models with suitable prior predictive distributions. This is achieved by leveraging contrastive pretraining techniques and optimising a variational lower bound. We then show that the prior predictive distributions of self-supervised BNNs capture problem semantics better than conventional BNN priors. In turn, our approach offers improved predictive performance over conventional BNNs, especially in low-budget regimes.</description>

      <title>DiffLoad: Uncertainty Quantification in Electrical Load Forecasting with Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01001v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrical load forecasting plays a crucial role in decision-making for power systems, including unit commitment and economic dispatch. The integration of renewable energy sources and the occurrence of external events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have rapidly increased uncertainties in load forecasting. The uncertainties in load forecasting can be divided into two types: epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty. Separating these types of uncertainties can help decision-makers better understand where and to what extent the uncertainty is, thereby enhancing their confidence in the following decision-making. This paper proposes a diffusion-based Seq2Seq structure to estimate epistemic uncertainty and employs the robust additive Cauchy distribution to estimate aleatoric uncertainty. Our method not only ensures the accuracy of load forecasting but also demonstrates the ability to separate the two types of uncertainties and be applicable to different levels of loads.

      <title>Mending of Spatio-Temporal Dependencies in Block Adjacency Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of applications where data dynamically evolves across spatial and temporal dimensions, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often complemented by sequence modeling architectures, such as RNNs and transformers, to effectively model temporal changes. These hybrid models typically arrange the spatial and temporal learning components in series. A pioneering effort to jointly model the spatio-temporal dependencies using only GNNs was the introduction of the Block Adjacency Matrix \(\mathbf{A_B}\) \cite{1}, which was constructed by diagonally concatenating adjacency matrices from graphs at different time steps. This approach resulted in a single graph encompassing complete spatio-temporal data; however, the graphs from different time steps remained disconnected, limiting GNN message-passing to spatially connected nodes only. Addressing this critical challenge, we propose a novel end-to-end learning architecture specifically designed to mend the temporal dependencies, resulting in a well-connected graph. Thus, we provide a framework for the learnable representation of spatio-temporal data as graphs. Our methodology demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets, such as SurgVisDom and C2D2, surpassing existing state-of-the-art graph models in terms of accuracy. Our model also achieves significantly lower computational complexity, having far fewer parameters than methods reliant on CLIP and 3D CNN architectures.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Knowledge Editing of Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are becoming increasingly pervasive in academia and industry, matching and surpassing human performance on a wide variety of fields and related tasks. However, just as humans, even the largest artificial neural networks make mistakes, and once-correct predictions can become invalid as the world progresses in time. Augmenting datasets with samples that account for mistakes or up-to-date information has become a common workaround in practical applications. However, the well-known phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting poses a challenge in achieving precise changes in the implicitly memorized knowledge of neural network parameters, often requiring a full model re-training to achieve desired behaviors. That is expensive, unreliable, and incompatible with the current trend of large self-supervised pre-training, making it necessary to find more efficient and effective methods for adapting neural network models to changing data. To address this need, knowledge editing is emerging as a novel area of research that aims to enable reliable, data-efficient, and fast changes to a pre-trained target model, without affecting model behaviors on previously learned tasks. In this survey, we provide a brief review of this recent artificial intelligence field of research. We first introduce the problem of editing neural networks, formalize it in a common framework and differentiate it from more notorious branches of research such as continuous learning. Next, we provide a review of the most relevant knowledge editing approaches and datasets proposed so far, grouping works under four different families: regularization techniques, meta-learning, direct model editing, and architectural strategies. Finally, we outline some intersections with other fields of research and potential directions for future works.</description>

      <title>Invariant Causal Prediction with Local Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the task of identifying the causal parents of a target variable among a set of candidates from observational data. Our main assumption is that the candidate variables are observed in different environments which may, under certain assumptions, be regarded as interventions on the observed system. We assume a linear relationship between target and candidates, which can be different in each environment with the only restriction that the causal structure is invariant across environments. Within our proposed setting we provide sufficient conditions for identifiability of the causal parents and introduce a practical method called L-ICP ($\textbf{L}$ocalized $\textbf{I}$nvariant $\textbf{Ca}$usal $\textbf{P}$rediction), which is based on a hypothesis test for parent identification using a ratio of minimum and maximum statistics. We then show in a simplified setting that the statistical power of L-ICP converges exponentially fast in the sample size, and finally we analyze the behavior of L-ICP experimentally in more general settings.</description>

      <title>Transformers are Expressive, But Are They Expressive Enough for Regression?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers have become pivotal in Natural Language Processing, demonstrating remarkable success in applications like Machine Translation and Summarization. Given their widespread adoption, several works have attempted to analyze the expressivity of Transformers. Expressivity of a neural network is the class of functions it can approximate. A neural network is fully expressive if it can act as a universal function approximator. We attempt to analyze the same for Transformers. Contrary to existing claims, our findings reveal that Transformers struggle to reliably approximate smooth functions, relying on piecewise constant approximations with sizable intervals. The central question emerges as: ''Are Transformers truly Universal Function Approximators?'' To address this, we conduct a thorough investigation, providing theoretical insights and supporting evidence through experiments. Theoretically, we prove that Transformer Encoders cannot approximate smooth functions. Experimentally, we complement our theory and show that the full Transformer architecture cannot approximate smooth functions. By shedding light on these challenges, we advocate a refined understanding of Transformers' capabilities. Code Link: https://github.com/swaroop-nath/transformer-expressivity.</description>

      <title>Learning the irreversible progression trajectory of Alzheimer's disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible brain disorder that unfolds over the course of 30 years. Therefore, it is critical to capture the disease progression in an early stage such that intervention can be applied before the onset of symptoms. Machine learning (ML) models have been shown effective in predicting the onset of AD. Yet for subjects with follow-up visits, existing techniques for AD classification only aim for accurate group assignment, where the monotonically increasing risk across follow-up visits is usually ignored. Resulted fluctuating risk scores across visits violate the irreversibility of AD, hampering the trustworthiness of models and also providing little value to understanding the disease progression. To address this issue, we propose a novel regularization approach to predict AD longitudinally. Our technique aims to maintain the expected monotonicity of increasing disease risk during progression while preserving expressiveness. Specifically, we introduce a monotonicity constraint that encourages the model to predict disease risk in a consistent and ordered manner across follow-up visits. We evaluate our method using the longitudinal structural MRI and amyloid-PET imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our model outperforms existing techniques in capturing the progressiveness of disease risk, and at the same time preserves prediction accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tree ensembles achieve state-of-the-art performance on numerous prediction tasks. We propose $\textbf{J}$oint $\textbf{O}$ptimization of $\textbf{P}$iecewise $\textbf{L}$inear $\textbf{En}$sembles (JOPLEn), which jointly fits piecewise linear models at all leaf nodes of an existing tree ensemble. In addition to enhancing the ensemble expressiveness, JOPLEn allows several common penalties, including sparsity-promoting and subspace-norms, to be applied to nonlinear prediction. For example, JOPLEn with a nuclear norm penalty learns subspace-aligned functions. Additionally, JOPLEn (combined with a Dirty LASSO penalty) is an effective feature selection method for nonlinear prediction in multitask learning. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of JOPLEn on 153 regression and classification datasets and with a variety of penalties. JOPLEn leads to improved prediction performance relative to not only standard random forest and boosted tree ensembles, but also other methods for enhancing tree ensembles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discounted algorithms often encounter evaluation errors due to their reliance on short-term estimations, which can impede their efficacy in addressing simple, short-term tasks and impose undesired temporal discounts (\(\gamma\)). Interestingly, these algorithms are often tested without applying a discount, a phenomenon we refer as the \textit{train-test bias}. In response to these challenges, we propose the Markov Flow Policy, which utilizes a non-negative neural network flow to enable comprehensive forward-view predictions. Through integration into the TD7 codebase and evaluation using the MuJoCo benchmark, we observe significant performance improvements, positioning MFP as a straightforward, practical, and easily implementable solution within the domain of average rewards algorithms.</description>

      <title>Estimating Direct and Indirect Causal Effects of Spatiotemporal Interventions in Presence of Spatial Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial interference (SI) occurs when the treatment at one location affects the outcomes at other locations. Accounting for spatial interference in spatiotemporal settings poses further challenges as interference violates the stable unit treatment value assumption, making it infeasible for standard causal inference methods to quantify the effects of time-varying treatment at spatially varying outcomes. In this paper, we first formalize the concept of spatial interference in case of time-varying treatment assignments by extending the potential outcome framework under the assumption of no unmeasured confounding. We then propose our deep learning based potential outcome model for spatiotemporal causal inference. We utilize latent factor modeling to reduce the bias due to time-varying confounding while leveraging the power of U-Net architecture to capture global and local spatial interference in data over time. Our causal estimators are an extension of average treatment effect (ATE) for estimating direct (DATE) and indirect effects (IATE) of spatial interference on treated and untreated data. Being the first of its kind deep learning based spatiotemporal causal inference technique, our approach shows advantages over several baseline methods based on the experiment results on two synthetic datasets, with and without spatial interference. Our results on real-world climate dataset also align with domain knowledge, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of robust policy networks in deep reinforcement learning. We investigate the benefits of policy parameterizations that naturally satisfy constraints on their Lipschitz bound, analyzing their empirical performance and robustness on two representative problems: pendulum swing-up and Atari Pong. We illustrate that policy networks with smaller Lipschitz bounds are more robust to disturbances, random noise, and targeted adversarial attacks than unconstrained policies composed of vanilla multi-layer perceptrons or convolutional neural networks. However, the structure of the Lipschitz layer is important. We find that the widely-used method of spectral normalization is too conservative and severely impacts clean performance, whereas more expressive Lipschitz layers such as the recently-proposed Sandwich layer can achieve improved robustness without sacrificing clean performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of low-power wearables for the biomedical domain has received a lot of attention in recent decades, as technological advances in chip manufacturing have allowed real-time monitoring of patients using low-complexity ML within the mW range. Despite advances in application and hardware design research, the domain lacks a systematic approach to hardware evaluation. In this work, we propose BiomedBench, a new benchmark suite composed of complete end-to-end TinyML biomedical applications for real-time monitoring of patients using wearable devices. Each application presents different requirements during typical signal acquisition and processing phases, including varying computational workloads and relations between active and idle times. Furthermore, our evaluation of five state-of-the-art low-power platforms in terms of energy efficiency shows that modern platforms cannot effectively target all types of biomedical applications. BiomedBench is released as an open-source suite to standardize hardware evaluation and guide hardware and application design in the TinyML wearable domain.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the application of deep-learning diffusion models for the super-resolution of weather data, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the spatial resolution and detail of meteorological variables. Leveraging the capabilities of diffusion models, specifically the SR3 and ResDiff architectures, we present a methodology for transforming low-resolution weather data into high-resolution outputs. Our experiments, conducted using the WeatherBench dataset, focus on the super-resolution of the two-meter temperature variable, demonstrating the models' ability to generate detailed and accurate weather maps. The results indicate that the ResDiff model, further improved by incorporating physics-based modifications, significantly outperforms traditional SR3 methods in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). This research highlights the potential of diffusion models in meteorological applications, offering insights into their effectiveness, challenges, and prospects for future advancements in weather prediction and climate analysis.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a guide to the foundations of learning Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) from data in the form of multiple samples of trajectories for some length of time. We present the formalism for a generic as well as a set of common types of DBNs for particular variable distributions. We present the analytical form of the models, with a comprehensive discussion on the interdependence between structure and weights in a DBN model and their implications for learning. Next, we give a broad overview of learning methods and describe and categorize them based on the most important statistical features, and how they treat the interplay between learning structure and weights. We give the analytical form of the likelihood and Bayesian score functions, emphasizing the distinction from the static case. We discuss functions used in optimization to enforce structural requirements. We briefly discuss more complex extensions and representations. Finally we present a set of comparisons in different settings for various distinct but representative algorithms across the variants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical diagnostics represents a significant advancement in managing upper gastrointestinal (GI) cancer, a major cause of global cancer mortality. Specifically for gastric cancer (GC), chronic inflammation causes changes in the mucosa such as atrophy, intestinal metaplasia (IM), dysplasia and ultimately cancer. Early detection through endoscopic regular surveillance is essential for better outcomes. Foundation models (FM), which are machine or deep learning models trained on diverse data and applicable to broad use cases, offer a promising solution to enhance the accuracy of endoscopy and its subsequent pathology image analysis. This review explores the recent advancements, applications, and challenges associated with FM in endoscopy and pathology imaging. We started by elucidating the core principles and architectures underlying these models, including their training methodologies and the pivotal role of large-scale data in developing their predictive capabilities. Moreover, this work discusses emerging trends and future research directions, emphasizing the integration of multimodal data, the development of more robust and equitable models, and the potential for real-time diagnostic support. This review aims to provide a roadmap for researchers and practitioners in navigating the complexities of incorporating FM into clinical practice for prevention/management of GC cases, thereby improving patient outcomes.</description>

ARLC features a novel and more broadly applicable training objective for abductive reasoning, resulting in better interpretability and higher accuracy when solving Raven's progressive matrices (RPM). ARLC allows both programming domain knowledge and learning the rules underlying a data distribution. We evaluate ARLC on the I-RAVEN dataset, showcasing state-of-the-art accuracy across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (unseen attribute-rule pairs) tests. ARLC surpasses neuro-symbolic and connectionist baselines, including large language models, despite having orders of magnitude fewer parameters. We show ARLC's robustness to post-programming training by incrementally learning from examples on top of programmed knowledge, which only improves its performance and does not result in catastrophic forgetting of the programmed solution. We validate ARLC's seamless transfer learning from a 2x2 RPM constellation to unseen constellations.

      <title>Etalon: Holistic Performance Evaluation Framework for LLM Inference Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Serving large language models (LLMs) in production can incur substantial costs, which has prompted recent advances in inference system optimizations. Today, these systems are evaluated against conventional latency and throughput metrics (eg. TTFT, TBT, Normalised Latency and TPOT). However, these metrics fail to fully capture the nuances of LLM inference, leading to an incomplete assessment of user-facing performance crucial for real-time applications such as chat and translation. In this paper, we first identify the pitfalls of current performance metrics in evaluating LLM inference systems. We then propose Etalon, a comprehensive performance evaluation framework that includes fluidity-index -- a novel metric designed to reflect the intricacies of the LLM inference process and its impact on real-time user experience. Finally, we evaluate various existing open-source platforms and model-as-a-service offerings using Etalon, discussing their strengths and weaknesses. Etalon is available at https://github.com/project-etalon/etalon.</description>

      <title>On the Causal Sufficiency and Necessity of Multi-Modal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An effective paradigm of multi-modal learning (MML) is to learn unified representations among modalities. From a causal perspective, constraining the consistency between different modalities can mine causal representations that convey primary events. However, such simple consistency may face the risk of learning insufficient or unnecessary information: a necessary but insufficient cause is invariant across modalities but may not have the required accuracy; a sufficient but unnecessary cause tends to adapt well to specific modalities but may be hard to adapt to new data. To address this issue, in this paper, we aim to learn representations that are both causal sufficient and necessary, i.e., Causal Complete Cause ($C^3$), for MML. Firstly, we define the concept of $C^3$ for MML, which reflects the probability of being causal sufficiency and necessity. We also propose the identifiability and measurement of $C^3$, i.e., $C^3$ risk, to ensure calculating the learned representations' $C^3$ scores in practice. Then, we theoretically prove the effectiveness of $C^3$ risk by establishing the performance guarantee of MML with a tight generalization bound. Based on these theoretical results, we propose a plug-and-play method, namely Causal Complete Cause Regularization ($C^3$R), to learn causal complete representations by constraining the $C^3$ risk bound. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of $C^3$R.</description>

      <title>Anchored Preference Optimization and Contrastive Revisions: Addressing Underspecification in Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often aligned using contrastive alignment objectives and preference pair datasets. The interaction between model, paired data, and objective makes alignment a complicated procedure, sometimes producing subpar results. We study this and find that (i) preference data gives a better learning signal when the underlying responses are contrastive, and (ii) alignment objectives lead to better performance when they specify more control over the model during training. Based on these insights, we introduce Contrastive Learning from AI Revisions (CLAIR), a data-creation method which leads to more contrastive preference pairs, and Anchored Preference Optimization (APO), a controllable and more stable alignment objective. We align Llama-3-8B-Instruct using various comparable datasets and alignment objectives and measure MixEval-Hard scores, which correlate highly with human judgments. The CLAIR preferences lead to the strongest performance out of all datasets, and APO consistently outperforms less controllable objectives. Our best model, trained on 32K CLAIR preferences with APO, improves Llama-3-8B-Instruct by 7.65%, closing the gap with GPT4-turbo by 45%. Our code is available at https://github.com/ContextualAI/CLAIR_and_APO.</description>

      <title>Model-based RL as a Minimalist Approach to Horizon-Free and Second-Order Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning a transition model via Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) followed by planning inside the learned model is perhaps the most standard and simplest Model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. In this work, we show that such a simple Model-based RL scheme, when equipped with optimistic and pessimistic planning procedures, achieves strong regret and sample complexity bounds in online and offline RL settings. Particularly, we demonstrate that under the conditions where the trajectory-wise reward is normalized between zero and one and the transition is time-homogenous, it achieves horizon-free and second-order bounds. Horizon-free means that our bounds have no polynomial dependence on the horizon of the Markov Decision Process. A second-order bound is a type of instance-dependent bound that scales with respect to the variances of the returns of the policies which can be small when the system is nearly deterministic and (or) the optimal policy has small values. We highlight that our algorithms are simple, fairly standard, and indeed have been extensively studied in the RL literature: they learn a model via MLE, build a version space around the MLE solution, and perform optimistic or pessimistic planning depending on whether operating in the online or offline mode. These algorithms do not rely on additional specialized algorithmic designs such as learning variances and performing variance-weighted learning and thus can leverage rich function approximations that are significantly beyond linear or tabular structures. The simplicity of the algorithms also implies that our horizon-free and second-order regret analysis is actually standard and mainly follows the general framework of optimism/pessimism in the face of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Non-Homophilic Graph Pre-Training and Prompt Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphs are ubiquitous for modeling complex relationships between objects across various fields. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a mainstream technique for graph-based applications, but their performance heavily relies on abundant labeled data. To reduce labeling requirement, pre-training and prompt learning has become a popular alternative. However, most existing prompt methods do not differentiate homophilic and heterophilic characteristics of real-world graphs. In particular, many real-world graphs are non-homophilic, not strictly or uniformly homophilic with mixing homophilic and heterophilic patterns, exhibiting varying non-homophilic characteristics across graphs and nodes. In this paper, we propose ProNoG, a novel pre-training and prompt learning framework for such non-homophilic graphs. First, we analyze existing graph pre-training methods, providing theoretical insights into the choice of pre-training tasks. Second, recognizing that each node exhibits unique non-homophilic characteristics, we propose a conditional network to characterize the node-specific patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze ProNoG through extensive experiments on ten public datasets.</description>

      <title>Towards Graph Prompt Learning: A Survey and Beyond</title>

Abstract: Large-scale "pre-train and prompt learning" paradigms have demonstrated remarkable adaptability, enabling broad applications across diverse domains such as question answering, image recognition, and multimodal retrieval. This approach fully leverages the potential of large-scale pre-trained models, reducing downstream data requirements and computational costs while enhancing model applicability across various tasks. Graphs, as versatile data structures that capture relationships between entities, play pivotal roles in fields such as social network analysis, recommender systems, and biological graphs. Despite the success of pre-train and prompt learning paradigms in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), their application in graph domains remains nascent. In graph-structured data, not only do the node and edge features often have disparate distributions, but the topological structures also differ significantly. This diversity in graph data can lead to incompatible patterns or gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning on downstream graphs. We aim to bridge this gap by summarizing methods for alleviating these disparities. This includes exploring prompt design methodologies, comparing related techniques, assessing application scenarios and datasets, and identifying unresolved problems and challenges. This survey categorizes over 100 relevant works in this field, summarizing general design principles and the latest applications, including text-attributed graphs, molecules, proteins, and recommendation systems. Through this extensive review, we provide a foundational understanding of graph prompt learning, aiming to impact not only the graph mining community but also the broader Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) community.</description>

      <title>SciLitLLM: How to Adapt LLMs for Scientific Literature Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific literature understanding is crucial for extracting targeted information and garnering insights, thereby significantly advancing scientific discovery. Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), they face challenges in scientific literature understanding, primarily due to (1) a lack of scientific knowledge and (2) unfamiliarity with specialized scientific tasks.
  To develop an LLM specialized in scientific literature understanding, we propose a hybrid strategy that integrates continual pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to simultaneously infuse scientific domain knowledge and enhance instruction-following capabilities for domain-specific tasks.cIn this process, we identify two key challenges: (1) constructing high-quality CPT corpora, and (2) generating diverse SFT instructions. We address these challenges through a meticulous pipeline, including PDF text extraction, parsing content error correction, quality filtering, and synthetic instruction creation. Applying this strategy, we present a suite of LLMs: SciLitLLM, specialized in scientific literature understanding. These models demonstrate promising performance on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.
  Our contributions are threefold: (1) We present an effective framework that integrates CPT and SFT to adapt LLMs to scientific literature understanding, which can also be easily adapted to other domains. (2) We propose an LLM-based synthesis method to generate diverse and high-quality scientific instructions, resulting in a new instruction set -- SciLitIns -- for supervised fine-tuning in less-represented scientific domains. (3) SciLitLLM achieves promising performance improvements on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Robust Statistical Scaling of Outlier Scores: Improving the Quality of Outlier Probabilities for Outliers (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Outlier detection algorithms typically assign an outlier score to each observation in a dataset, indicating the degree to which an observation is an outlier. However, these scores are often not comparable across algorithms and can be difficult for humans to interpret. Statistical scaling addresses this problem by transforming outlier scores into outlier probabilities without using ground-truth labels, thereby improving interpretability and comparability across algorithms. However, the quality of this transformation can be different for outliers and inliers. Missing outliers in scenarios where they are of particular interest - such as healthcare, finance, or engineering - can be costly or dangerous. Thus, ensuring good probabilities for outliers is essential. This paper argues that statistical scaling, as commonly used in the literature, does not produce equally good probabilities for outliers as for inliers. Therefore, we propose robust statistical scaling, which uses robust estimators to improve the probabilities for outliers. We evaluate several variants of our method against other outlier score transformations for real-world datasets and outlier detection algorithms, where it can improve the probabilities for outliers.</description>

      <title>High Probability Complexity Bounds for Non-Smooth Stochastic Optimization with Heavy-Tailed Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.05958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic first-order methods are standard for training large-scale machine learning models. Random behavior may cause a particular run of an algorithm to result in a highly suboptimal objective value, whereas theoretical guarantees are usually proved for the expectation of the objective value. Thus, it is essential to theoretically guarantee that algorithms provide small objective residual with high probability. Existing methods for non-smooth stochastic convex optimization have complexity bounds with the dependence on the confidence level that is either negative-power or logarithmic but under an additional assumption of sub-Gaussian (light-tailed) noise distribution that may not hold in practice. In our paper, we resolve this issue and derive the first high-probability convergence results with logarithmic dependence on the confidence level for non-smooth convex stochastic optimization problems with non-sub-Gaussian (heavy-tailed) noise. To derive our results, we propose novel stepsize rules for two stochastic methods with gradient clipping. Moreover, our analysis works for generalized smooth objectives with H\"older-continuous gradients, and for both methods, we provide an extension for strongly convex problems. Finally, our results imply that the first (accelerated) method we consider also has optimal iteration and oracle complexity in all the regimes, and the second one is optimal in the non-smooth setting.</description>

      <title>Dense-Sparse Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Training for Image Denoising</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.04857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, deep learning methods such as the convolutional neural networks have gained prominence in the area of image denoising. This is owing to their proven ability to surpass state-of-the-art classical image denoising algorithms such as block-matching and 3D filtering algorithm. Deep denoising convolutional neural networks use many feed-forward convolution layers with added regularization methods of batch normalization and residual learning to speed up training and improve denoising performance significantly. However, this comes at the expense of a huge number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we show that by employing an enhanced dense-sparse-dense network training procedure to the deep denoising convolutional neural networks, comparable denoising performance level can be achieved at a significantly reduced number of trainable parameters. We derive motivation from the fact that networks trained using the dense-sparse-dense approach have been shown to attain performance boost with reduced number of parameters. The proposed reduced deep denoising convolutional neural networks network is an efficient denoising model with significantly reduced parameters and comparable performance to the deep denoising convolutional neural networks. Additionally, denoising was achieved at significantly reduced processing time.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein multivariate auto-regressive models for modeling distributional time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is focused on the statistical analysis of data consisting of a collection of multiple series of probability measures that are indexed by distinct time instants and supported over a bounded interval of the real line. By modeling these time-dependent probability measures as random objects in the Wasserstein space, we propose a new auto-regressive model for the statistical analysis of multivariate distributional time series. Using the theory of iterated random function systems, results on the existence, uniqueness and stationarity of the solution of such a model are provided. We also propose a consistent estimator for the auto-regressive coefficients of this model. Due to the simplex constraints that we impose on the model coefficients, the proposed estimator that is learned under these constraints, naturally has a sparse structure. The sparsity allows the application of the proposed model in learning a graph of temporal dependency from multivariate distributional time series. We explore the numerical performances of our estimation procedure using simulated data. To shed some light on the benefits of our approach for real data analysis, we also apply this methodology to a data set made of observations from age distribution in different countries.</description>

      <title>Complexity of High-Dimensional Identity Testing with Coordinate Conditional Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.09102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the identity testing problem for high-dimensional distributions. Given as input an explicit distribution $\mu$, an $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and access to sampling oracle(s) for a hidden distribution $\pi$, the goal in identity testing is to distinguish whether the two distributions $\mu$ and $\pi$ are identical or are at least $\varepsilon$-far apart. When there is only access to full samples from the hidden distribution $\pi$, it is known that exponentially many samples (in the dimension) may be needed for identity testing, and hence previous works have studied identity testing with additional access to various "conditional" sampling oracles. We consider a significantly weaker conditional sampling oracle, which we call the $\mathsf{Coordinate\ Oracle}$, and provide a computational and statistical characterization of the identity testing problem in this new model.
  We prove that if an analytic property known as approximate tensorization of entropy holds for an $n$-dimensional visible distribution $\mu$, then there is an efficient identity testing algorithm for any hidden distribution $\pi$ using $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ queries to the $\mathsf{Coordinate\ Oracle}$. Approximate tensorization of entropy is a pertinent condition as recent works have established it for a large class of high-dimensional distributions. We also prove a computational phase transition: for a well-studied class of $n$-dimensional distributions, specifically sparse antiferromagnetic Ising models over $\{+1,-1\}^n$, we show that in the regime where approximate tensorization of entropy fails, there is no efficient identity testing algorithm unless $\mathsf{RP}=\mathsf{NP}$. We complement our results with a matching $\Omega(n/\varepsilon)$ statistical lower bound for the sample complexity of identity testing in the $\mathsf{Coordinate\ Oracle}$ model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised models have had great success in learning speech representations that can generalize to various downstream tasks. However, most self-supervised models require a large amount of compute and multiple GPUs to train, significantly hampering the development of self-supervised learning. In an attempt to reduce the computation of training, we revisit the training of HuBERT, a highly successful self-supervised model. We improve and simplify several key components, including the loss function, input representation, and training in multiple stages. Our model, MelHuBERT, is able to achieve favorable performance on phone recognition, speaker identification, and automatic speech recognition against HuBERT, while saving 31.2% of the pre-training time, or equivalently 33.5% MACs per one second speech. The code and pre-trained models are available in https://github.com/nervjack2/MelHuBERT.</description>

      <title>A Newton-CG based barrier-augmented Lagrangian method for general nonconvex conic optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider finding an approximate second-order stationary point (SOSP) of general nonconvex conic optimization that minimizes a twice differentiable function subject to nonlinear equality constraints and also a convex conic constraint. In particular, we propose a Newton-conjugate gradient (Newton-CG) based barrier-augmented Lagrangian method for finding an approximate SOSP of this problem. Under some mild assumptions, we show that our method enjoys a total inner iteration complexity of $\widetilde{\cal O}(\epsilon^{-11/2})$ and an operation complexity of $\widetilde{\cal O}(\epsilon^{-11/2}\min\{n,\epsilon^{-5/4}\})$ for finding an $(\epsilon,\sqrt{\epsilon})$-SOSP of general nonconvex conic optimization with high probability. Moreover, under a constraint qualification, these complexity bounds are improved to $\widetilde{\cal O}(\epsilon^{-7/2})$ and $\widetilde{\cal O}(\epsilon^{-7/2}\min\{n,\epsilon^{-3/4}\})$, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the complexity of finding an approximate SOSP of general nonconvex conic optimization. Preliminary numerical results are presented to demonstrate superiority of the proposed method over first-order methods in terms of solution quality.</description>

      <title>Hyperparameter Optimization as a Service on INFN Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simplest and often most effective way of parallelizing the training of complex machine learning models is to execute several training instances on multiple machines, scanning the hyperparameter space to optimize the underlying statistical model and the learning procedure. Often, such a meta-learning procedure is limited by the ability of accessing securely a common database organizing the knowledge of the previous and ongoing trials. Exploiting opportunistic GPUs provided in different environments represents a further challenge when designing such optimization campaigns. In this contribution, we discuss how a set of REST APIs can be used to access a dedicated service based on INFN Cloud to monitor and coordinate multiple training instances, with gradient-less optimization techniques, via simple HTTP requests. The service, called Hopaas (Hyperparameter OPtimization As A Service), is made of a web interface and sets of APIs implemented with a FastAPI backend running through Uvicorn and NGINX in a virtual instance of INFN Cloud. The optimization algorithms are currently based on Bayesian techniques as provided by Optuna. A Python frontend is also made available for quick prototyping. We present applications to hyperparameter optimization campaigns performed by combining private, INFN Cloud, and CINECA resources. Such multi-node multi-site optimization studies have given a significant boost to the development of a set of parameterizations for the ultra-fast simulation of the LHCb experiment.</description>

      <title>Recursive Estimation of Conditional Kernel Mean Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel mean embeddings, a widely used technique in machine learning, map probability distributions to elements of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). For supervised learning problems, where input-output pairs are observed, the conditional distribution of outputs given the inputs is a key object. The input dependent conditional distribution of an output can be encoded with an RKHS valued function, the conditional kernel mean map. In this paper we present a new recursive algorithm to estimate the conditional kernel mean map in a Hilbert space valued $L_2$ space, that is in a Bochner space. We prove the weak and strong $L_2$ consistency of our recursive estimator under mild conditions. The idea is to generalize Stone's theorem for Hilbert space valued regression in a locally compact Polish space. We present new insights about conditional kernel mean embeddings and give strong asymptotic bounds regarding the convergence of the proposed recursive method. Finally, the results are demonstrated on three application domains: for inputs coming from Euclidean spaces, Riemannian manifolds and locally compact subsets of function spaces.</description>

      <title>Lamarr: LHCb ultra-fast simulation based on machine learning models deployed within Gauss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: About 90% of the computing resources available to the LHCb experiment has been spent to produce simulated data samples for Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The upgraded LHCb detector will be able to collect larger data samples, requiring many more simulated events to analyze the data to be collected in Run 3. Simulation is a key necessity of analysis to interpret signal, reject background and measure efficiencies. The needed simulation will far exceed the pledged resources, requiring an evolution in technologies and techniques to produce these simulated data samples. In this contribution, we discuss Lamarr, a Gaudi-based framework to speed-up the simulation production parameterizing both the detector response and the reconstruction algorithms of the LHCb experiment. Deep Generative Models powered by several algorithms and strategies are employed to effectively parameterize the high-level response of the single components of the LHCb detector, encoding within neural networks the experimental errors and uncertainties introduced in the detection and reconstruction phases. Where possible, models are trained directly on real data, statistically subtracting any background components by applying appropriate reweighing procedures. Embedding Lamarr in the general LHCb Gauss Simulation framework allows to combine its execution with any of the available generators in a seamless way. The resulting software package enables a simulation process independent of the detailed simulation used to date.</description>

      <title>EEGMatch: Learning with Incomplete Labels for Semi-Supervised EEG-based Cross-Subject Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is an objective tool for emotion recognition and shows promising performance. However, the label scarcity problem is a main challenge in this field, which limits the wide application of EEG-based emotion recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning framework (EEGMatch) to leverage both labeled and unlabeled EEG data. First, an EEG-Mixup based data augmentation method is developed to generate more valid samples for model learning. Second, a semi-supervised two-step pairwise learning method is proposed to bridge prototype-wise and instance-wise pairwise learning, where the prototype-wise pairwise learning measures the global relationship between EEG data and the prototypical representation of each emotion class and the instance-wise pairwise learning captures the local intrinsic relationship among EEG data. Third, a semi-supervised multi-domain adaptation is introduced to align the data representation among multiple domains (labeled source domain, unlabeled source domain, and target domain), where the distribution mismatch is alleviated. Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark databases (SEED and SEED-IV) under a cross-subject leave-one-subject-out cross-validation evaluation protocol. The results show the proposed EEGmatch performs better than the state-of-the-art methods under different incomplete label conditions (with 6.89% improvement on SEED and 1.44% improvement on SEED-IV), which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed EEGMatch in dealing with the label scarcity problem in emotion recognition using EEG signals.

      <title>Loop Copilot: Conducting AI Ensembles for Music Generation and Iterative Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating music is iterative, requiring varied methods at each stage. However, existing AI music systems fall short in orchestrating multiple subsystems for diverse needs. To address this gap, we introduce Loop Copilot, a novel system that enables users to generate and iteratively refine music through an interactive, multi-round dialogue interface. The system uses a large language model to interpret user intentions and select appropriate AI models for task execution. Each backend model is specialized for a specific task, and their outputs are aggregated to meet the user's requirements. To ensure musical coherence, essential attributes are maintained in a centralized table. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system through semi-structured interviews and questionnaires, highlighting its utility not only in facilitating music creation but also its potential for broader applications.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Adversarial Attacks on Deep Neural Networks for Targeted Class Manipulation Using DeepFool Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13019v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The susceptibility of deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial attacks undermines their reliability across numerous applications, underscoring the necessity for an in-depth exploration of these vulnerabilities and the formulation of robust defense strategies. The DeepFool algorithm by Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. (2016) represents a pivotal step in identifying minimal perturbations required to induce misclassification of input images. Nonetheless, its generic methodology falls short in scenarios necessitating targeted interventions. Additionally, previous research studies have predominantly concentrated on the success rate of attacks without adequately addressing the consequential distortion of images, the maintenance of image quality, or the confidence threshold required for misclassification. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the Enhanced Targeted DeepFool (ET DeepFool) algorithm, an evolution of DeepFool that not only facilitates the specification of desired misclassification targets but also incorporates a configurable minimum confidence score. Our empirical investigations demonstrate the superiority of this refined approach in maintaining the integrity of images and minimizing perturbations across a variety of DNN architectures. Unlike previous iterations, such as the Targeted DeepFool by Gajjar et al. (2022), our method grants unparalleled control over the perturbation process, enabling precise manipulation of model responses. Preliminary outcomes reveal that certain models, including AlexNet and the advanced Vision Transformer, display commendable robustness to such manipulations. This discovery of varying levels of model robustness, as unveiled through our confidence level adjustments, could have far-reaching implications for the field of image recognition. Our code will be made public upon acceptance of the paper.</description>

      <title>WhiteFox: White-Box Compiler Fuzzing Empowered by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compiler correctness is crucial, as miscompilation can falsify program behaviors, leading to serious consequences. Fuzzing has been studied to uncover compiler defects. However, compiler fuzzing remains challenging: Existing arts focus on black- and grey-box fuzzing, which generates tests without sufficient understanding of internal compiler behaviors. Meanwhile, traditional white-box techniques, like symbolic execution, are computationally inapplicable to the giant codebase of compilers. Recent advances demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in code generation/understanding tasks. Nonetheless, guiding LLMs with compiler source-code information remains a missing piece of research in compiler testing.
  To this end, we propose WhiteFox, the first white-box compiler fuzzer using LLMs with source-code information to test compiler optimization, with a spotlight on detecting deep logic bugs in the deep learning (DL) compilers. WhiteFox adopts a multi-agent framework: an LLM-based analysis agent examines the low-level optimization source code and produces requirements on the high-level test programs that can trigger the optimization; an LLM-based generation agent produces test programs based on the summarized requirements. Additionally, optimization-triggering tests are used as feedback to enhance the generation on the fly. Our evaluation on the three most popular DL compilers (i.e., PyTorch Inductor, TensorFlow-XLA, and TensorFlow Lite) shows WhiteFox can generate high-quality test programs to exercise deep optimizations, practicing up to 8X more than state-of-the-art fuzzers. WhiteFox has found 101 bugs for the DL compilers, with 92 confirmed as previously unknown and 70 fixed. WhiteFox has been acknowledged by the PyTorch team and is being incorporated into its development workflow. Beyond DL compilers, WhiteFox can also be adapted for compilers in different domains.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of probabilistic contact tracing in epidemic containment: the role of super-spreaders and transmission path reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent COVID-19 pandemic underscores the significance of early-stage non-pharmacological intervention strategies. The widespread use of masks and the systematic implementation of contact tracing strategies provide a potentially equally effective and socially less impactful alternative to more conventional approaches, such as large-scale mobility restrictions. However, manual contact tracing faces strong limitations in accessing the network of contacts, and the scalability of currently implemented protocols for smartphone-based digital contact tracing becomes impractical during the rapid expansion phases of the outbreaks, due to the surge in exposure notifications and associated tests. A substantial improvement in digital contact tracing can be obtained through the integration of probabilistic techniques for risk assessment that can more effectively guide the allocation of new diagnostic tests. In this study, we first quantitatively analyze the diagnostic and social costs associated with these containment measures based on contact tracing, employing three state-of-the-art models of SARS-CoV-2 spreading. Our results suggest that probabilistic techniques allow for more effective mitigation at a lower cost. Secondly, our findings reveal a remarkable efficacy of probabilistic contact-tracing techniques in performing backward and multi-step tracing and capturing super-spreading events.</description>

      <title>Object-Centric Diffusion for Efficient Video Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based video editing have reached impressive quality and can transform either the global style, local structure, and attributes of given video inputs, following textual edit prompts. However, such solutions typically incur heavy memory and computational costs to generate temporally-coherent frames, either in the form of diffusion inversion and/or cross-frame attention. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of such inefficiencies, and suggest simple yet effective modifications that allow significant speed-ups whilst maintaining quality. Moreover, we introduce Object-Centric Diffusion, to fix generation artifacts and further reduce latency by allocating more computations towards foreground edited regions, arguably more important for perceptual quality. We achieve this by two novel proposals: i) Object-Centric Sampling, decoupling the diffusion steps spent on salient or background regions and spending most on the former, and ii) Object-Centric Token Merging, which reduces cost of cross-frame attention by fusing redundant tokens in unimportant background regions. Both techniques are readily applicable to a given video editing model without retraining, and can drastically reduce its memory and computational cost. We evaluate our proposals on inversion-based and control-signal-based editing pipelines, and show a latency reduction up to 10x for a comparable synthesis quality.

      <title>Empowering Aggregators with Practical Data-Driven Tools: Harnessing Aggregated and Disaggregated Flexibility for Demand Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10726v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the interaction between aggregators and building occupants in activating flexibility through Demand Response (DR) programs, with a focus on reinforcing the resilience of the energy system considering the uncertainties presented by Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Firstly, it introduces a methodology of optimizing aggregated flexibility provision strategies in environments with limited data, utilizing Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) and clustering techniques to identify building occupants' activity patterns. Secondly, the study assesses the disaggregated flexibility provision of Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems during DR events, employing machine learning and optimization techniques for precise, device-level analysis. The first approach offers a non-intrusive pathway for aggregators to provide flexibility services in environments of a single smart meter for the whole building's consumption, while the second approach maximizes the amount of flexibility in the case of dedicated metering devices to the HVAC systems by carefully considering building occupants' thermal comfort profiles. Through the application of data-driven techniques and encompassing case studies from both industrial and residential buildings, this paper not only unveils pivotal opportunities for aggregators in the balancing and emerging flexibility markets but also successfully develops and demonstrates end-to-end practical tools for aggregators.</description>

      <title>Generative Design of Crystal Structures by Point Cloud Representations and Diffusion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently generating energetically stable crystal structures has long been a challenge in material design, primarily due to the immense arrangement of atoms in a crystal lattice. To facilitate the discovery of stable material, we present a framework for the generation of synthesizable materials, leveraging a point cloud representation to encode intricate structural information. At the heart of this framework lies the introduction of a diffusion model as its foundational pillar. To gauge the efficacy of our approach, we employ it to reconstruct input structures from our training datasets, rigorously validating its high reconstruction performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the profound potential of Point Cloud-Based Crystal Diffusion (PCCD) by generating entirely new materials, emphasizing their synthesizability. Our research stands as a noteworthy contribution to the advancement of materials design and synthesis through the cutting-edge avenue of generative design instead of the conventional substitution or experience-based discovery.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks in EEG-based Emotion Recognition: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compared to other modalities, EEG-based emotion recognition can intuitively respond to the emotional patterns in the human brain and, therefore, has become one of the most concerning tasks in the brain-computer interfaces field. Since dependencies within brain regions are closely related to emotion, a significant trend is to develop Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for EEG-based emotion recognition. However, brain region dependencies in emotional EEG have physiological bases that distinguish GNNs in this field from those in other time series fields. Besides, there is neither a comprehensive review nor guidance for constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In the survey, our categorization reveals the commonalities and differences of existing approaches under a unified framework of graph construction. We analyze and categorize methods from three stages in the framework to provide clear guidance on constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In addition, we discuss several open challenges and future directions, such as Temporal full-connected graph and Graph condensation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Distance Approximation for Persistence Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological Data Analysis methods can be useful for classification and clustering tasks in many different fields as they can provide two dimensional persistence diagrams that summarize important information about the shape of potentially complex and high dimensional data sets. The space of persistence diagrams can be endowed with various metrics such as the Wasserstein distance which admit a statistical structure and allow to use these summaries for machine learning algorithms. However, computing the distance between two persistence diagrams involves finding an optimal way to match the points of the two diagrams and may not always be an easy task for classical computers. In this work we explore the potential of quantum computers to estimate the distance between persistence diagrams, in particular we propose variational quantum algorithms for the Wasserstein distance as well as the $d^{c}_{p}$ distance. Our implementation is a weighted version of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm that relies on control clauses to encode the constraints of the optimization problem.</description>

      <title>A Deep-Learning Technique to Locate Cryptographic Operations in Side-Channel Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Side-channel attacks allow extracting secret information from the execution of cryptographic primitives by correlating the partially known computed data and the measured side-channel signal. However, to set up a successful side-channel attack, the attacker has to perform i) the challenging task of locating the time instant in which the target cryptographic primitive is executed inside a side-channel trace and then ii)the time-alignment of the measured data on that time instant. This paper presents a novel deep-learning technique to locate the time instant in which the target computed cryptographic operations are executed in the side-channel trace. In contrast to state-of-the-art solutions, the proposed methodology works even in the presence of trace deformations obtained through random delay insertion techniques. We validated our proposal through a successful attack against a variety of unprotected and protected cryptographic primitives that have been executed on an FPGA-implemented system-on-chip featuring a RISC-V CPU.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Named Entity Recognition: A comparative analysis of mono- and multilingual transformer models on a novel Brazilian corporate earnings call transcripts dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since 2018, when the Transformer architecture was introduced, Natural Language Processing has gained significant momentum with pre-trained Transformer-based models that can be fine-tuned for various tasks. Most models are pre-trained on large English corpora, making them less applicable to other languages, such as Brazilian Portuguese. In our research, we identified two models pre-trained in Brazilian Portuguese (BERTimbau and PTT5) and two multilingual models (mBERT and mT5). BERTimbau and mBERT use only the Encoder module, while PTT5 and mT5 use both the Encoder and Decoder. Our study aimed to evaluate their performance on a financial Named Entity Recognition (NER) task and determine the computational requirements for fine-tuning and inference. To this end, we developed the Brazilian Financial NER (BraFiNER) dataset, comprising sentences from Brazilian banks' earnings calls transcripts annotated using a weakly supervised approach. Additionally, we introduced a novel approach that reframes the token classification task as a text generation problem. After fine-tuning the models, we evaluated them using performance and error metrics. Our findings reveal that BERT-based models consistently outperform T5-based models. While the multilingual models exhibit comparable macro F1-scores, BERTimbau demonstrates superior performance over PTT5. In terms of error metrics, BERTimbau outperforms the other models. We also observed that PTT5 and mT5 generated sentences with changes in monetary and percentage values, highlighting the importance of accuracy and consistency in the financial domain. Our findings provide insights into the differing performance of BERT- and T5-based models for the NER task.</description>

      <title>Fast Fishing: Approximating BAIT for Efficient and Scalable Deep Active Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep active learning (AL) seeks to minimize the annotation costs for training deep neural networks. BAIT, a recently proposed AL strategy based on the Fisher Information, has demonstrated impressive performance across various datasets. However, BAIT's high computational and memory requirements hinder its applicability on large-scale classification tasks, resulting in current research neglecting BAIT in their evaluation. This paper introduces two methods to enhance BAIT's computational efficiency and scalability. Notably, we significantly reduce its time complexity by approximating the Fisher Information. In particular, we adapt the original formulation by i) taking the expectation over the most probable classes, and ii) constructing a binary classification task, leading to an alternative likelihood for gradient computations. Consequently, this allows the efficient use of BAIT on large-scale datasets, including ImageNet. Our unified and comprehensive evaluation across a variety of datasets demonstrates that our approximations achieve strong performance with considerably reduced time complexity. Furthermore, we provide an extensive open-source toolbox that implements recent state-of-the-art AL strategies, available at https://github.com/dhuseljic/dal-toolbox.</description>

      <title>Hoaxpedia: A Unified Wikipedia Hoax Articles Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hoaxes are a recognised form of disinformation created deliberately, with potential serious implications in the credibility of reference knowledge resources such as Wikipedia. What makes detecting Wikipedia hoaxes hard is that they often are written according to the official style guidelines. In this work, we first provide a systematic analysis of similarities and discrepancies between legitimate and hoax Wikipedia articles, and introduce Hoaxpedia, a collection of 311 hoax articles (from existing literature and official Wikipedia lists), together with semantically similar legitimate articles, which together form a binary text classification dataset aimed at fostering research in automated hoax detection. In this paper, We report results after analyzing several language models, hoax-to-legit ratios, and the amount of text classifiers are exposed to (full article vs the article's definition alone). Our results suggest that detecting deceitful content in Wikipedia based on content alone is hard but feasible, and complement our analysis with a study on the differences in distributions in edit histories, and find that looking at this feature yields better classification results than context.</description>

      <title>DAISY: Data Adaptive Self-Supervised Early Exit for Speech Representation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have shown to be useful for various tasks, but their large size limits the use in devices with low computing power and memory. In this work, we explore early exit, an approach for reducing latency by exiting the forward process of a network early. Most approaches of early exit need a separate early exit model for each task, with some even requiring fine-tuning of the entire pretrained model. We introduce Data Adaptive Self-Supervised Early Exit (DAISY), an approach that decides when to exit based on the self-supervised loss, eliminating the need for multiple round of training and fine-tuning. DAISY matches the performance of HuBERT on the MiniSUPERB benchmark, but with much faster inference times. Our analysis on the adaptivity of DAISY shows that the model exits early (using fewer layers) on clean data while exits late (using more layers) on noisy data, dynamically adjusting the computational cost of inference based on the noise level of each sample.</description>

      <title>Are Small Language Models Ready to Compete with Large Language Models for Practical Applications?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid rise of Language Models (LMs) has expanded their use in several applications. Yet, due to constraints of model size, associated cost, or proprietary restrictions, utilizing state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs is not always feasible. With open, smaller LMs emerging, more applications can leverage their capabilities, but selecting the right LM can be challenging as smaller LMs don't perform well universally. This work tries to bridge this gap by proposing a framework to experimentally evaluate small, open LMs in practical settings through measuring semantic correctness of outputs across three practical aspects: task types, application domains and reasoning types, using diverse prompt styles. It also conducts an in-depth comparison of 10 small, open LMs to identify best LM and prompt style depending on specific application requirement using the proposed framework. We also show that if selected appropriately, they can outperform SOTA LLMs like DeepSeek-v2, GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-1.5-Pro, and even compete with GPT-4o.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12614v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces EUvsDisinfo, a multilingual dataset of disinformation articles originating from pro-Kremlin outlets, along with trustworthy articles from credible / less biased sources. It is sourced directly from the debunk articles written by experts leading the EUvsDisinfo project. Our dataset is the largest to-date resource in terms of the overall number of articles and distinct languages. It also provides the largest topical and temporal coverage. Using this dataset, we investigate the dissemination of pro-Kremlin disinformation across different languages, uncovering language-specific patterns targeting certain disinformation topics. We further analyse the evolution of topic distribution over an eight-year period, noting a significant surge in disinformation content before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Lastly, we demonstrate the dataset's applicability in training models to effectively distinguish between disinformation and trustworthy content in multilingual settings.</description>

      <title>Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses Against Large Language Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have performed exceptionally in various text-generative tasks, including question answering, translation, code completion, etc. However, the over-assistance of LLMs has raised the challenge of "jailbreaking", which induces the model to generate malicious responses against the usage policy and society by designing adversarial prompts. With the emergence of jailbreak attack methods exploiting different vulnerabilities in LLMs, the corresponding safety alignment measures are also evolving. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive and detailed taxonomy of jailbreak attack and defense methods. For instance, the attack methods are divided into black-box and white-box attacks based on the transparency of the target model. Meanwhile, we classify defense methods into prompt-level and model-level defenses. Additionally, we further subdivide these attack and defense methods into distinct sub-classes and present a coherent diagram illustrating their relationships. We also conduct an investigation into the current evaluation methods and compare them from different perspectives. Our findings aim to inspire future research and practical implementations in safeguarding LLMs against adversarial attacks. Above all, although jailbreak remains a significant concern within the community, we believe that our work enhances the understanding of this domain and provides a foundation for developing more secure LLMs.</description>

      <title>Parameters Inference for Nonlinear Wave Equations with Markovian Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional partial differential equations with constant coefficients often struggle to capture abrupt changes in real-world phenomena, leading to the development of variable coefficient PDEs and Markovian switching models. Recently, research has introduced the concept of PDEs with Markov switching models, established their well-posedness and presented numerical methods. However, there has been limited discussion on parameter estimation for the jump coefficients in these models. This paper addresses this gap by focusing on parameter inference for the wave equation with Markovian switching. We propose a Bayesian statistical framework using discrete sparse Bayesian learning to establish its convergence and a uniform error bound. Our method requires fewer assumptions and enables independent parameter inference for each segment by allowing different underlying structures for the parameter estimation problem within each segmented time interval. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through three numerical cases, which involve noisy spatiotemporal data from different wave equations with Markovian switching. The results show strong performance in parameter estimation for variable coefficient PDEs.</description>

      <title>Perceptual Similarity for Measuring Decision-Making Style and Policy Diversity in Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defining and measuring decision-making styles, also known as playstyles, is crucial in gaming, where these styles reflect a broad spectrum of individuality and diversity. However, finding a universally applicable measure for these styles poses a challenge. Building on Playstyle Distance, the first unsupervised metric to measure playstyle similarity based on game screens and raw actions, we introduce three enhancements to increase accuracy: multiscale analysis with varied state granularity, a perceptual kernel rooted in psychology, and the utilization of the intersection-over-union method for efficient evaluation. These innovations not only advance measurement precision but also offer insights into human cognition of similarity. Across two racing games and seven Atari games, our techniques significantly improve the precision of zero-shot playstyle classification, achieving an accuracy exceeding 90 percent with fewer than 512 observation-action pairs, which is less than half an episode of these games. Furthermore, our experiments with 2048 and Go demonstrate the potential of discrete playstyle measures in puzzle and board games. We also develop an algorithm for assessing decision-making diversity using these measures. Our findings improve the measurement of end-to-end game analysis and the evolution of artificial intelligence for diverse playstyles.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection in Time Series of EDFA Pump Currents to Monitor Degeneration Processes using Fuzzy Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article proposes a novel fuzzy clustering based anomaly detection method for pump current time series of EDFA systems. The proposed change detection framework (CDF) strategically combines the advantages of entropy analysis (EA) and principle component analysis (PCA) with fuzzy clustering procedures. In the framework, EA is applied for dynamic selection of features for reduction of the feature space and increase of computational performance. Furthermore, PCA is utilized to extract features from the raw feature space to enable generalization capability of the subsequent fuzzy clustering procedures. Three different fuzzy clustering methods, more precisely the fuzzy clustering algorithm, a probabilistic clustering algorithm and a possibilistic clustering algorithm are evaluated for performance and generalization. Hence, the proposed framework has the innovative feature to detect changes in pump current time series at an early stage for arbitrary points of operation, compared to state-of-the-art predefined alarms in commercially used EDFAs. Moreover, the approach is implemented and tested using experimental data. In addition, the proposed framework enables further approaches of applying decentralized predictive maintenance for optical fiber networks.</description>

      <title>Mini-Omni: Language Models Can Hear, Talk While Thinking in Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in language models have achieved significant progress. GPT-4o, as a new milestone, has enabled real-time conversations with humans, demonstrating near-human natural fluency. Such human-computer interaction necessitates models with the capability to perform reasoning directly with the audio modality and generate output in streaming. However, this remains beyond the reach of current academic models, as they typically depend on extra TTS systems for speech synthesis, resulting in undesirable latency. This paper introduces the Mini-Omni, an audio-based end-to-end conversational model, capable of real-time speech interaction. To achieve this capability, we propose a text-instructed speech generation method, along with batch-parallel strategies during inference to further boost the performance. Our method also helps to retain the original model's language capabilities with minimal degradation, enabling other works to establish real-time interaction capabilities. We call this training method "Any Model Can Talk". We also introduce the VoiceAssistant-400K dataset to fine-tune models optimized for speech output. To our best knowledge, Mini-Omni is the first fully end-to-end, open-source model for real-time speech interaction, offering valuable potential for future research.</description>
