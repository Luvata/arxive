      <title>Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs via Object-aware Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options (i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.</description>

      <title>SDiFL: Stable Diffusion-Driven Framework for Image Forgery Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance. Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3, thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image. Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were entirely unseen during training.</description>

      <title>Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models with Quantitative Skin Attributes: A Retrieval Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice. To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g., lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Automatic Modulation Recognition With a Reconstruction-Driven Vision Transformer Under Limited Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised, self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust, discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only 15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and label-efficient solution for AMR.</description>

      <title>InfinityHuman: Towards Long-Term Audio-Driven Human</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts, and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled, resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made public.</description>

      <title>Spherical Vision Transformers for Audio-Visual Saliency Prediction in 360-Degree Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments, addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking, demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional videos. Code and dataset will be available at https://cyberiada.github.io/SalViT360.</description>

      <title>A Novel Framework for Automated Explain Vision Model Using Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with xAI analysis to advance image analysis.</description>

      <title>ATMS-KD: Adaptive Temperature and Mixed Sample Knowledge Distillation for a Lightweight Residual CNN in Agricultural Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated: Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis, southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to 95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.</description>

      <title>Linking heterogeneous microstructure informatics with expert characterization knowledge through customized and hybrid vision-language representations for industrial qualification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach. Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable qualification strategies in engineering informatics.</description>

      <title>MedNet-PVS: A MedNeXt-Based Deep Learning Model for Automated Segmentation of Perivascular Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network, for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of 0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature. The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG). MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high accuracy in PVS segmentation.</description>

      <title>Plug-in Feedback Self-adaptive Attention in CLIP for Training-free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self, and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently improves their performance across eight benchmarks.</description>

      <title>How Multimodal LLMs Solve Image Tasks: A Lens on Visual Grounding, Task Reasoning, and Answer Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories (e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization, instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal representation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Latent Embeddings with Sparse Linear Concept Subspaces (SLiCS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks. We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence. Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS) enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.</description>

      <title>MedFoundationHub: A Lightweight and Secure Toolkit for Deploying Medical Vision Language Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation, copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1) enables physicians to manually select and use different models without programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs (Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases, yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and inconsistent pathology terminology.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Mamba Decoder with Bidirectional Interaction in Multi-Task Dense Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture, BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks, \emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its state-of-the-art competitors.</description>

      <title>Audio-Guided Visual Editing with Complex Multi-Modal Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio, where text-only approaches fail.</description>

      <title>More Reliable Pseudo-labels, Better Performance: A Generalized Approach to Single Positive Multi-label Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort, motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated. Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling (AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Low-Latency Spiking Neural Networks with Temporal-Dependent Integrate-and-Fire Neuron Model for Objects Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks. Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps. Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low latency (within 5 time-steps).</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Uncertainty Modeling and Multimodal Fusion for Salient Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network (DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets, especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.</description>

      <title>MSMVD: Exploiting Multi-scale Image Features via Multi-scale BEV Features for Multi-view Pedestrian Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views. Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.</description>

      <title>A Spatial-Frequency Aware Multi-Scale Fusion Network for Real-Time Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques, forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across applications like video conferencing and social media. Although state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency, with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.</description>

      <title>Dual-Model Weight Selection and Self-Knowledge Distillation for Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost, followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans, and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Re-Densification Meets Cross-Scale Propagation: Real-Time Compression of LiDAR Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead. Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding. This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization.

      <title>Droplet3D: Commonsense Priors from Videos Facilitate 3D Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However, this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities. Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand, videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework, and model weights: https://dropletx.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Realistic and Controllable 3D Gaussian-Guided Object Editing for Driving Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous. Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects. Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Corpus Callosum Segmentation in Fetal MRI via Pathology-Informed Domain Randomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant malformations.</description>

However, such systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT) and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication. Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation. We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii) exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii) achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves SLT performance.</description>

      <title>Video-MTR: Reinforced Multi-Turn Reasoning for Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU, and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video understanding.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Dual Uncertainty Optimization: Boosting Monocular 3D Object Detection under Test-Time Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference. While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD. Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.</description>

      <title>CaddieSet: A Golf Swing Dataset with Human Joint Features and Ball Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers' shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory, limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot. CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore, based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.</description>

      <title>IAENet: An Importance-Aware Ensemble Model for 3D Point Cloud-Based Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models. However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial: existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate, underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.</description>

      <title>Describe, Don't Dictate: Semantic Image Editing with Natural Language Intent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion. Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it improves editing accuracy and consistency.</description>

      <title>DCFS: Continual Test-Time Adaptation via Dual Consistency of Feature and Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning. This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C, demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Adam SLAM - the last mile of camera calibration with 3DGS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake of novel view quality is the most important.</description>

      <title>Learning What is Worth Learning: Active and Sequential Domain Adaptation for Multi-modal Gross Tumor Volume Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness. Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods.

      <title>Enhancing Pseudo-Boxes via Data-Level LiDAR-Camera Fusion for Unsupervised 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space, while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation benchmark.</description>

      <title>Digital Scale: Open-Source On-Device BMI Estimation from Smartphone Camera Images Trained on a Large-Scale Real-World Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from 25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views. This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training, filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source contributions.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptation Techniques for Natural and Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557 simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective adaptation of models to medical data.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch for Video Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes, making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images. Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch (CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101, respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Mechanistic Defenses Against Typographic Attacks in CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to 19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility of text recognition.</description>

However, challenges such as occlusion, expression variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines. Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.</description>

      <title>FastFit: Accelerating Multi-Reference Virtual Try-On via Cacheable Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead. This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms, dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode, and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in inference efficiency.</description>

      <title>UTA-Sign: Unsupervised Thermal Video Augmentation via Event-Assisted Traffic Signage Sketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.</description>

      <title>Disruptive Attacks on Face Swapping via Low-Frequency Perceptual Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation, reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.</description>

      <title>Embracing Aleatoric Uncertainty: Generating Diverse 3D Human Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text. Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in text consistency.</description>

      <title>Optimization-Based Calibration for Intravascular Ultrasound Volume Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS) offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ, which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate 3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance intraoperative guidance.</description>

      <title>Physics Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML) models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples. In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising results to optimize the defect localization process.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Privacy Risks of Split Inference: A GAN-Based Data Reconstruction Attack via Progressive Feature Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy. However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors, limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios, out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.</description>

      <title>EmoCAST: Emotional Talking Portrait via Emotive Text Description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling, emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive, and audio-synchronized talking-head videos.

      <description>arXiv:2508.20621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection, particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers, acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase at https://github.com/smriti-joshi/bcnaim-odelia-challenge.git.</description>

      <title>AvatarBack: Back-Head Generation for Complete 3D Avatars from Front-View Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy (ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training, effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric, photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.</description>

      <title>ArtFace: Towards Historical Portrait Face Identification via Model Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians, offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent, and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/</description>

      <title>CraftGraffiti: Exploring Human Identity with Custom Graffiti Art via Facial-Preserving Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence. We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after" paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order. Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.</description>

      <title>Improving Alignment in LVLMs with Debiased Self-Judgment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets, human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods, offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.</description>

      <title>"Humor, Art, or Misinformation?": A Multimodal Dataset for Intent-Aware Synthetic Image Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art, or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies (image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning, reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.</description>

      <title>MobileCLIP2: Improving Multi-Modal Reinforced Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient, scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe 2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary teachers using distributed scalable processing.</description>

      <title>Learned Rate Control for Frame-Level Adaptive Neural Video Compression via Dynamic Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off. Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and bitrate-constrained applications. Our code is available at https://git.openi.org.cn/OpenAICoding/DynamicDVC.</description>

      <title>CardioMorphNet: Cardiac Motion Prediction Using a Shape-Guided Bayesian Recurrent Deep Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities. Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods, indicating higher confidence in its predictions.</description>

      <title>Mix, Align, Distil: Reliable Cross-Domain Atypical Mitosis Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2. The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.</description>

      <title>Pref-GRPO: Pairwise Preference Reward-based GRPO for Stable Text-to-Image Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens when minimal score differences between images are amplified after normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM, and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences, providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally, existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20 subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27 sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.</description>

      <title>${C}^{3}$-GS: Learning Context-aware, Cross-dimension, Cross-scale Feature for Generalizable Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters, enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware, cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability.

      <title>SeqVLM: Proposal-Guided Multi-View Sequences Reasoning via VLM for Zero-Shot 3D Visual Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements. However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%, respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world applicability.

      <title>Occlusion Robustness of CLIP for Military Vehicle Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around 35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for real-world deployment of CLIP.</description>

      <title>SKGE-SWIN: End-To-End Autonomous Vehicle Waypoint Prediction and Navigation Using Skip Stage Swin Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model performance.</description>

      <title>Looking Beyond the Obvious: A Survey on Abstract Concept Recognition for Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation models.</description>

      <title>Safer Skin Lesion Classification with Global Class Activation Probability Map Evaluation and SafeML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformers.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Compositional Generalisation in VLMs and Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts. Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years, however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models -- Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of relational concepts such as left and right.

      <title>Surfel-based 3D Registration with Equivariant SE(3) Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations. To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss. Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Adapting Foundation Model for Dental Caries Detection with Dual-View Co-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets, indicating the clinical applicability of our method.

      <title>FusionCounting: Robust visible-infrared image fusion guided by crowd counting via multi-task learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation, making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions, we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves superior crowd counting performance.</description>

      <title>Estimating 2D Keypoints of Surgical Tools Using Vision-Language Models with Low-Rank Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.</description>

      <title>PointDGRWKV: Generalizing RWKV-like Architecture to Unseen Domains for Point Cloud Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization. To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition, Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.</description>

      <title>PathMR: Multimodal Visual Reasoning for Interpretable Pathology Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives, these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will be publicly available in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/PathMR.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Framework for Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer Using Multi-Modal Medical Imaging Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging: autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs). Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training, achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Understanding and evaluating computer vision models through the lens of counterfactuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution (LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular, training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias evaluation and mitigation.</description>

      <title>To New Beginnings: A Survey of Unified Perception in Autonomous Vehicle Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow. We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust, generalizable, and interpretable perception.</description>

      <title>Dino U-Net: Exploiting High-Fidelity Dense Features from Foundation Models for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the 7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the accuracy of medical image segmentation.

      <title>Classifying Mitotic Figures in the MIDOG25 Challenge with Deep Ensemble Learning and Rule Based Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading. Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult, as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based refinement (RBR) module. On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific metrics but requires further research.</description>

      <title>COMETH: Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and Tracking of Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/PARCO-LAB/COMETH.</description>

Abstract: In the context of proven climate change, maintaining olive biodiversity through early anomaly detection and treatment using remote sensing technology is crucial, offering effective management solutions. This paper presents an innovative approach to olive tree segmentation from satellite images. By leveraging foundational models and advanced segmentation techniques, the study integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to accurately identify and segment olive trees in agricultural plots.

      <title>E-ConvNeXt: A Lightweight and Efficient ConvNeXt Variant with Cross-Stage Partial Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized designs. The new network is named E-ConvNeXt, which can maintain high accuracy performance under different complexity configurations. The three core innovations of E-ConvNeXt are : (1) integrating the Cross Stage Partial Network (CSPNet) with ConvNeXt and adjusting the network structure, which reduces the model's network complexity by up to 80%; (2) Optimizing the Stem and Block structures to enhance the model's feature expression capability and operational efficiency; (3) Replacing Layer Scale with channel attention. Experimental validation on ImageNet classification demonstrates E-ConvNeXt's superior accuracy-efficiency balance: E-ConvNeXt-mini reaches 78.3% Top-1 accuracy at 0.9GFLOPs. E-ConvNeXt-small reaches 81.9% Top-1 accuracy at 3.1GFLOPs. Transfer learning tests on object detection tasks further confirm its generalization capability.</description>

      <title>DrivingGaussian++: Towards Realistic Reconstruction and Editable Simulation for Surrounding Dynamic Driving Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DrivingGaussian++, an efficient and effective framework for realistic reconstructing and controllable editing of surrounding dynamic autonomous driving scenes. DrivingGaussian++ models the static background using incremental 3D Gaussians and reconstructs moving objects with a composite dynamic Gaussian graph, ensuring accurate positions and occlusions. By integrating a LiDAR prior, it achieves detailed and consistent scene reconstruction, outperforming existing methods in dynamic scene reconstruction and photorealistic surround-view synthesis. DrivingGaussian++ supports training-free controllable editing for dynamic driving scenes, including texture modification, weather simulation, and object manipulation, leveraging multi-view images and depth priors. By integrating large language models (LLMs) and controllable editing, our method can automatically generate dynamic object motion trajectories and enhance their realism during the optimization process. DrivingGaussian++ demonstrates consistent and realistic editing results and generates dynamic multi-view driving scenarios, while significantly enhancing scene diversity.

      <title>Webly-Supervised Image Manipulation Localization via Category-Aware Auto-Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization. Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1 average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/qcf-568/MIML.</description>

      <title>ExpertSim: Fast Particle Detector Simulation Using Mixture-of-Generative-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods, offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at https://github.com/patrick-bedkowski/expertsim-mix-of-generative-experts.</description>

      <title>ChainReaction! Structured Approach with Causal Chains as Intermediate Representations for Improved and Explainable Causal Video Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs, and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine across diverse domains.

      <title>POSE: Phased One-Step Adversarial Equilibrium for Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences. Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models. To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii) conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment, temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining competitive performance.</description>

      <title>Reusing Computation in Text-to-Image Diffusion for Efficient Generation of Image Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency, we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models, where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of large-scale text-to-image generation.

      <title>Mitosis detection in domain shift scenarios: a Mamba-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor assessment. Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show large room for improvement for the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A multi-task neural network for atypical mitosis recognition under domain shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this problem. By exploiting auxiliary tasks, correlated to the main classification task, the proposed approach, submitted to the track 2 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) challenge, aims to aid the model to focus only on the object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation conducted on three distinct datasets, i.e., the MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training Set, the Ami-Br dataset, as well as the preliminary test set of the MIDOG25 challenge.</description>

      <title>FW-GAN: Frequency-Driven Handwriting Synthesis with Wave-Modulated MLP Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples. Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations. First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second, they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines.

      <title>MMG-Vid: Maximizing Marginal Gains at Segment-level and Token-level for Efficient Video LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically, we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>CogVLA: Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action Model via Instruction-Driven Routing &amp; Sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens, forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing) introduces action intent into the language model by pruning instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention (CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/CogVLA.</description>

      <title>Veritas: Generalizable Deepfake Detection via Pattern-Aware Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice, typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures, emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource, we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as "planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains. Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.</description>

      <title>FakeParts: a New Family of AI-Generated DeepFakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle, localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods for partial video manipulations.</description>

      <title>Multi-View 3D Point Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively. Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world applications.

      <title>OneReward: Unified Mask-Guided Image Generation via Multi-Task Human Preference Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model. By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives. We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across multiple evaluation dimensions.

      <description>arXiv:2508.21070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Dress&amp;Dance, a video diffusion framework that generates high quality 5-second-long 24 FPS virtual try-on videos at 1152x720 resolution of a user wearing desired garments while moving in accordance with a given reference video. Our approach requires a single user image and supports a range of tops, bottoms, and one-piece garments, as well as simultaneous tops and bottoms try-on in a single pass. Key to our framework is CondNet, a novel conditioning network that leverages attention to unify multi-modal inputs (text, images, and videos), thereby enhancing garment registration and motion fidelity. CondNet is trained on heterogeneous training data, combining limited video data and a larger, more readily available image dataset, in a multistage progressive manner. Dress&amp;Dance outperforms existing open source and commercial solutions and enables a high quality and flexible try-on experience.</description>

      <title>First-Place Solution to NeurIPS 2024 Invisible Watermark Removal Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge. The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track, depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain. Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the development of more robust image watermarking methods.</description>

      <title>LoTUS: Large-Scale Machine Unlearning with a Taste of Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18314v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present LoTUS, a novel Machine Unlearning (MU) method that eliminates the influence of training samples from pre-trained models, avoiding retraining from scratch. LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of the model up to an information-theoretic bound, mitigating its over-confidence stemming from data memorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against eight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks, we evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining is impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the novel Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric to enable evaluation under real-world conditions. The experimental results show that LoTUS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. Code: https://github.com/cspartalis/LoTUS.</description>

      <title>Improving Liver Disease Diagnosis with SNNDeep: A Custom Spiking Neural Network Using Diverse Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently gained attention as energy-efficient, biologically plausible alternatives to conventional deep learning models. Their application in high-stakes biomedical imaging remains almost entirely unexplored. Methods: This study introduces SNNDeep, the first tailored SNN specifically optimized for binary classification of liver health status from computed tomography (CT) features. To ensure clinical relevance and broad generalizability, the model was developed and evaluated using the Task03\Liver dataset from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD), a standardized benchmark widely used for assessing performance across diverse medical imaging tasks. We benchmark three fundamentally different learning algorithms, namely Surrogate Gradient Learning, the Tempotron rule, and Bio-Inspired Active Learning across three architectural variants: a fully customized low-level model built from scratch, and two implementations using leading SNN frameworks, i.e., snnTorch and SpikingJelly. Hyperparameter optimization was performed using Optuna. Results: Our results demonstrate that the custom-built SNNDeep consistently outperforms framework-based implementations, achieving a maximum validation accuracy of 98.35%, superior adaptability across learning rules, and significantly reduced training overhead. Conclusion:This study provides the first empirical evidence that low-level, highly tunable SNNs can surpass standard frameworks in medical imaging, especially in data-limited, temporally constrained diagnostic settings, thereby opening a new pathway for neuro-inspired AI in precision medicine.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach to Volumetric Computations of Solid Pulmonary Nodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is crucial for effective treatment and relies on accurate volumetric assessment of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. Traditional methods, such as consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR) and spherical approximation, are limited by inconsistent estimates due to variability in nodule shape and density. We propose an advanced framework that combines a multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) with subtype-specific bias correction for precise volume estimation. The model was trained and evaluated on a dataset of 364 cases from Shanghai Chest Hospital. Our approach achieved a mean absolute deviation of 8.0 percent compared to manual nonlinear regression, with inference times under 20 seconds per scan. This method outperforms existing deep learning and semi-automated pipelines, which typically have errors of 25 to 30 percent and require over 60 seconds for processing. Our results show a reduction in error by over 17 percentage points and a threefold acceleration in processing speed. These advancements offer a highly accurate, efficient, and scalable tool for clinical lung nodule screening and monitoring, with promising potential for improving early lung cancer detection.</description>

      <title>Is the medical image segmentation problem solved? A survey of current developments and future directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation has advanced rapidly over the past two decades, largely driven by deep learning, which has enabled accurate and efficient delineation of cells, tissues, organs, and pathologies across diverse imaging modalities. This progress raises a fundamental question: to what extent have current models overcome persistent challenges, and what gaps remain? In this work, we provide an in-depth review of medical image segmentation, tracing its progress and key developments over the past decade. We examine core principles, including multiscale analysis, attention mechanisms, and the integration of prior knowledge, across the encoder, bottleneck, skip connections, and decoder components of segmentation networks. Our discussion is organized around seven key dimensions: (1) the shift from supervised to semi-/unsupervised learning, (2) the transition from organ segmentation to lesion-focused tasks, (3) advances in multi-modality integration and domain adaptation, (4) the role of foundation models and transfer learning, (5) the move from deterministic to probabilistic segmentation, (6) the progression from 2D to 3D and 4D segmentation, and (7) the trend from model invocation to segmentation agents. Together, these perspectives provide a holistic overview of the trajectory of deep learning-based medical image segmentation and aim to inspire future innovation. To support ongoing research, we maintain a continually updated repository of relevant literature and open-source resources at https://github.com/apple1986/medicalSegReview</description>

      <title>UltraEar: a multicentric, large-scale database combining ultra-high-resolution computed tomography and clinical data for ear diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ear diseases affect billions of people worldwide, leading to substantial health and socioeconomic burdens. Computed tomography (CT) plays a pivotal role in accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and outcome evaluation. The objective of this study is to present the establishment and design of UltraEar Database, a large-scale, multicentric repository of isotropic 0.1 mm ultra-high-resolution CT (U-HRCT) images and associated clinical data dedicated to ear diseases. UltraEar recruits patients from 11 tertiary hospitals between October 2020 and October 2035, integrating U-HRCT images, structured CT reports, and comprehensive clinical information, including demographics, audiometric profiles, surgical records, and pathological findings. A broad spectrum of otologic disorders is covered, such as otitis media, cholesteatoma, ossicular chain malformation, temporal bone fracture, inner ear malformation, cochlear aperture stenosis, enlarged vestibular aqueduct, and sigmoid sinus bony deficiency. Standardized preprocessing pipelines have been developed for geometric calibration, image annotation, and multi-structure segmentation. All personal identifiers in DICOM headers and metadata are removed or anonymized to ensure compliance with data privacy regulation. Data collection and curation are coordinated through monthly expert panel meetings, with secure storage on an offline cloud system. UltraEar provides an unprecedented ultra-high-resolution reference atlas with both technical fidelity and clinical relevance. This resource has significant potential to advance radiological research, enable development and validation of AI algorithms, serve as an educational tool for training in otologic imaging, and support multi-institutional collaborative studies. UltraEar will be continuously updated and expanded, ensuring long-term accessibility and usability for the global otologic research community.</description>

      <title>The Role of Teacher Calibration in Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore, we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving superior performance.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Privacy-Protecting Background Removal for 2D Video Streaming using iPhone 15 Pro Max LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology in consumer-grade mobile devices can be used as a replacement for traditional background removal and compositing techniques. Unlike approaches such as chroma keying and trained AI models, LiDAR's depth information is independent of subject lighting, and performs equally well in low-light and well-lit environments. We integrate the LiDAR and color cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro Max with GPU-based image processing. We use Apple's SwiftUI and Swift frameworks for user interface and backend development, and Metal Shader Language (MSL) for realtime image enhancement at the standard iPhone streaming frame rate of 60 frames per second. The only meaningful limitations of the technology are the streaming bandwidth of the depth data, which currently reduces the depth map resolution to 320x240, and any pre-existing limitations of the LiDAR IR laser to reflect accurate depth from some materials. If the LiDAR resolution on a mobile device like the iPhone can be improved to match the color image resolution, LiDAR could feasibly become the preeminent method of background removal for video applications and photography.</description>

      <title>GUARD: Guideline Upholding Test through Adaptive Role-play and Jailbreak Diagnostics for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains, their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline \textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of ``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs, including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning for Large Models in Medical Imaging: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated considerable potential in the realm of medical imaging. However, the development of high-performance AI models typically necessitates training on large-scale, centralized datasets. This approach is confronted with significant challenges due to strict patient privacy regulations and legal restrictions on data sharing and utilization. These limitations hinder the development of large-scale models in medical domains and impede continuous updates and training with new data. Federated Learning (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed training framework, offers a new solution by enabling collaborative model development across fragmented medical datasets. In this survey, we review FL's contributions at two stages of the full-stack medical analysis pipeline. First, in upstream tasks such as CT or MRI reconstruction, FL enables joint training of robust reconstruction networks on diverse, multi-institutional datasets, alleviating data scarcity while preserving confidentiality. Second, in downstream clinical tasks like tumor diagnosis and segmentation, FL supports continuous model updating by allowing local fine-tuning on new data without centralizing sensitive images. We comprehensively analyze FL implementations across the medical imaging pipeline, from physics-informed reconstruction networks to diagnostic AI systems, highlighting innovations that improve communication efficiency, align heterogeneous data, and ensure secure parameter aggregation. Meanwhile, this paper provides an outlook on future research directions, aiming to serve as a valuable reference for the field's development.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Distant Metastasis for Head and Neck Cancer Patients Using Multi-Modal Tumor and Peritumoral Feature Fusion Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastasis remains the major challenge in the clinical management of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Reliable pre-treatment prediction of metastatic risk is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and prognosis. This study develops a deep learning-based multimodal framework to predict metastasis risk in HNSCC patients by integrating computed tomography (CT) images, radiomics, and clinical data. 1497 HNSCC patients were included. Tumor and organ masks were derived from pretreatment CT images. A 3D Swin Transformer extracted deep features from tumor regions. Meanwhile, 1562 radiomics features were obtained using PyRadiomics, followed by correlation filtering and random forest selection, leaving 36 features. Clinical variables including age, sex, smoking, and alcohol status were encoded and fused with imaging-derived features. Multimodal features were fed into a fully connected network to predict metastasis risk. Performance was evaluated using five-fold cross-validation with area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), and specificity (SPE). The proposed fusion model outperformed single-modality models. The 3D deep learning module alone achieved an AUC of 0.715, and when combined with radiomics and clinical features, predictive performance improved (AUC = 0.803, ACC = 0.752, SEN = 0.730, SPE = 0.758). Stratified analysis showed generalizability across tumor subtypes. Ablation studies indicated complementary information from different modalities. Evaluation showed the 3D Swin Transformer provided more robust representation learning than conventional networks. This multimodal fusion model demonstrated high accuracy and robustness in predicting metastasis risk in HNSCC, offering a comprehensive representation of tumor biology. The interpretable model has potential as a clinical decision-support tool for personalized treatment planning.</description>

      <title>SPGrasp: Spatiotemporal Prompt-driven Grasp Synthesis in Dynamic Scenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time interactive grasp synthesis for dynamic objects remains challenging as existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment anything model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation. Our core innovation integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context, enabling real-time interaction with end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms while ensuring temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous tracking, SPGrasp achieves 92.0% accuracy with 73.1 ms per-frame latency, representing a 58.5% reduction compared to the prior state-of-the-art promptable method RoG-SAM while maintaining competitive accuracy. Real-world experiments involving 13 moving objects demonstrate a 94.8% success rate in interactive grasping scenarios. These results confirm SPGrasp effectively resolves the latency-interactivity trade-off in dynamic grasp synthesis. Code is available at https://github.com/sejmoonwei/SPGrasp.</description>

      <title>GENRE-CMR: Generalizable Deep Learning for Diverse Multi-Domain Cardiac MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accelerated Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) image reconstruction remains a critical challenge due to the trade-off between scan time and image quality, particularly when generalizing across diverse acquisition settings. We propose GENRE-CMR, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based architecture employing a residual deep unrolled reconstruction framework to enhance reconstruction fidelity and generalization. The architecture unrolls iterative optimization into a cascade of convolutional subnetworks, enriched with residual connections to enable progressive feature propagation from shallow to deeper stages. To further improve performance, we integrate two loss functions: (1) an Edge-Aware Region (EAR) loss, which guides the network to focus on structurally informative regions and helps prevent common reconstruction blurriness; and (2) a Statistical Distribution Alignment (SDA) loss, which regularizes the feature space across diverse data distributions via a symmetric KL divergence formulation. Extensive experiments confirm that GENRE-CMR surpasses state-of-the-art methods on training and unseen data, achieving 0.9552 SSIM and 38.90 dB PSNR on unseen distributions across various acceleration factors and sampling trajectories. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each proposed component to reconstruction quality and generalization. Our framework presents a unified and robust solution for high-quality CMR reconstruction, paving the way for clinically adaptable deployment across heterogeneous acquisition protocols.</description>

      <title>Masked Autoencoders for Ultrasound Signals: Robust Representation Learning for Downstream Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF) classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis through scalable, self-supervised learning.</description>

      <title>Unleashing Uncertainty: Efficient Machine Unlearning for Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SAFEMax, a novel method for Machine Unlearning in diffusion models. Grounded in information-theoretic principles, SAFEMax maximizes the entropy in generated images, causing the model to generate Gaussian noise when conditioned on impermissible classes by ultimately halting its denoising process. Also, our method controls the balance between forgetting and retention by selectively focusing on the early diffusion steps, where class-specific information is prominent. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SAFEMax and highlight its substantial efficiency gains over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>ActLoc: Learning to Localize on the Move via Active Viewpoint Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation, yet most existing systems implicitly assume that all viewing directions at a location are equally informative. In practice, localization becomes unreliable when the robot observes unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions. To address this, we present ActLoc, an active viewpoint-aware planning framework for enhancing localization accuracy for general robot navigation tasks. At its core, ActLoc employs a largescale trained attention-based model for viewpoint selection. The model encodes a metric map and the camera poses used during map construction, and predicts localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions at arbitrary 3D locations. These per-point accuracy distributions are incorporated into a path planner, enabling the robot to actively select camera orientations that maximize localization robustness while respecting task and motion constraints. ActLoc achieves stateof-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and generalizes effectively to fulltrajectory planning. Its modular design makes it readily applicable to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Fine-Tuning of DINOv3 Pretrained on Natural Images for Atypical Mitotic Figure Classification in MIDOG 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are markers of abnormal cell division associated with poor prognosis, yet their detection remains difficult due to low prevalence, subtle morphology, and inter-observer variability. The MIDOG 2025 challenge introduces a benchmark for AMF classification across multiple domains. In this work, we evaluate the recently published DINOv3-H+ vision transformer, pretrained on natural images, which we fine-tuned using low-rank adaptation (LoRA, 650k trainable parameters) and extensive augmentation. Despite the domain gap, DINOv3 transfers effectively to histopathology, achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.8871 on the preliminary test set. These results highlight the robustness of DINOv3 pretraining and show that, when combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, it provides a strong baseline for atypical mitosis classification in MIDOG 2025.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Contexts for Long Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module, Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine. In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities, actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models for Image Restoration and Enhancement: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image restoration (IR) has been an indispensable and challenging task in the low-level vision field, which strives to improve the subjective quality of images distorted by various forms of degradation. Recently, the diffusion model has achieved significant advancements in the visual generation of AIGC, thereby raising an intuitive question, "whether diffusion model can boost image restoration". To answer this, some pioneering studies attempt to integrate diffusion models into the image restoration task, resulting in superior performances than previous GAN-based methods. Despite that, a comprehensive and enlightening survey on diffusion model-based image restoration remains scarce. In this paper, we are the first to present a comprehensive review of recent diffusion model-based methods on image restoration, encompassing the learning paradigm, conditional strategy, framework design, modeling strategy, and evaluation. Concretely, we first introduce the background of the diffusion model briefly and then present two prevalent workflows that exploit diffusion models in image restoration. Subsequently, we classify and emphasize the innovative designs using diffusion models for both IR and blind/real-world IR, intending to inspire future development. To evaluate existing methods thoroughly, we summarize the commonly-used dataset, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present the objective comparison for open-sourced methods across three tasks, including image super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting. Ultimately, informed by the limitations in existing works, we propose five potential and challenging directions for the future research of diffusion model-based IR, including sampling efficiency, model compression, distortion simulation and estimation, distortion invariant learning, and framework design.</description>

      <title>ODES: Domain Adaptation with Expert Guidance for Online Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05407v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptive segmentation typically relies on self-training using pseudo labels predicted by a pre-trained network on an unlabeled target dataset. However, the noisy nature of such pseudo-labels presents a major bottleneck in adapting a network to the distribution shift between source and target datasets. This challenge is exaggerated when the network encounters an incoming data stream in online fashion, where the network is constrained to adapt to incoming streams of target domain data in exactly one round of forward and backward passes. In this scenario, relying solely on inaccurate pseudo-labels can lead to low-quality segmentation, which is detrimental to medical image analysis where accuracy and precision are of utmost priority. We hypothesize that a small amount of pixel-level annotation obtained from an expert can address this problem, thereby enhancing the performance of domain adaptation of online streaming data, even in the absence of dedicated training data. We call our method ODES: Domain Adaptation with Expert Guidance for Online Medical Image Segmentation that adapts to each incoming data batch in an online setup, incorporating feedback from an expert through active learning. Through active learning, the most informative pixels in each image can be selected for expert annotation. However, the acquisition of pixel-level annotations across all images in a batch often leads to redundant information while increasing temporal overhead in online learning. To reduce the annotation acquisition time and make the adaptation process more online-friendly, we further propose a novel image-pruning strategy that selects the most useful subset of images from the current batch for active learning. Our proposed approach outperforms existing online adaptation approaches and produces competitive results compared to offline domain adaptive active learning methods.</description>

      <title>VLMEvalKit: An Open-Source Toolkit for Evaluating Large Multi-Modality Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11691v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present VLMEvalKit: an open-source toolkit for evaluating large multi-modality models based on PyTorch. The toolkit aims to provide a user-friendly and comprehensive framework for researchers and developers to evaluate existing multi-modality models and publish reproducible evaluation results. In VLMEvalKit, we implement over 200+ different large multi-modality models, including both proprietary APIs and open-source models, as well as more than 80 different multi-modal benchmarks. By implementing a single interface, new models can be easily added to the toolkit, while the toolkit automatically handles the remaining workloads, including data preparation, distributed inference, prediction post-processing, and metric calculation. Although the toolkit is currently mainly used for evaluating large vision-language models, its design is compatible with future updates that incorporate additional modalities, such as audio and video. Based on the evaluation results obtained with the toolkit, we host OpenVLM Leaderboard, a comprehensive leaderboard to track the progress of multi-modality learning research. The toolkit is released on https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit and is actively maintained.</description>

      <title>Puppet-Master: Scaling Interactive Video Generation as a Motion Prior for Part-Level Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Puppet-Master, an interactive video generator that captures the internal, part-level motion of objects, serving as a proxy for modeling object dynamics universally. Given an image of an object and a set of "drags" specifying the trajectory of a few points on the object, the model synthesizes a video where the object's parts move accordingly. To build Puppet-Master, we extend a pre-trained image-to-video generator to encode the input drags. We also propose all-to-first attention, an alternative to conventional spatial attention that mitigates artifacts caused by fine-tuning a video generator on out-of-domain data. The model is fine-tuned on Objaverse-Animation-HQ, a new dataset of curated part-level motion clips obtained by rendering synthetic 3D animations. Unlike real videos, these synthetic clips avoid confounding part-level motion with overall object and camera motion. We extensively filter sub-optimal animations and augment the synthetic renderings with meaningful drags that emphasize the internal dynamics of objects. We demonstrate that Puppet-Master learns to generate part-level motions, unlike other motion-conditioned video generators that primarily move the object as a whole. Moreover, Puppet-Master generalizes well to out-of-domain real images, outperforming existing methods on real-world benchmarks in a zero-shot manner.</description>

      <title>See then Tell: Enhancing Key Information Extraction with Vision Grounding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the digital era, the ability to understand visually rich documents that integrate text, complex layouts, and imagery is critical. Traditional Key Information Extraction (KIE) methods primarily rely on Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which often introduces significant latency, computational overhead, and errors. Current advanced image-to-text approaches, which bypass OCR, typically yield plain text outputs without corresponding vision grounding. In this paper, we introduce STNet (See then Tell Net), a novel end-to-end model designed to deliver precise answers with relevant vision grounding. Distinctively, STNet utilizes a unique &lt;see&gt; token to observe pertinent image areas, aided by a decoder that interprets physical coordinates linked to this token. Positioned at the outset of the answer text, the &lt;see&gt; token allows the model to first see-observing the regions of the image related to the input question-and then tell-providing articulated textual responses. To enhance the model's seeing capabilities, we collect extensive structured table recognition datasets. Leveraging the advanced text processing prowess of GPT-4, we develop the TVG (TableQA with Vision Grounding) dataset, which not only provides text-based Question Answering (QA) pairs but also incorporates precise vision grounding for these pairs. Our approach demonstrates substantial advancements in KIE performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on publicly available datasets such as CORD, SROIE, and DocVQA. The code will also be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Improving Fine-Grained Control via Aggregation of Multiple Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01262v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While many diffusion models perform well when controlling particular aspects such as style, character, and interaction, they struggle with fine-grained control due to dataset limitations and intricate model architecture design. This paper introduces a novel training-free algorithm, independent of denoising network architectures, for fine-grained generation, called Aggregation of Multiple Diffusion Models (AMDM). The algorithm integrates features from multiple diffusion models into a specified model to activate particular features and enable fine-grained control. Experimental results demonstrate that AMDM significantly improves fine-grained control without training, validating its effectiveness. Additionally, it reveals that diffusion models initially focus on features such as position, attributes, and style, with later stages improving generation quality and consistency. AMDM offers a new perspective for tackling the challenges of fine-grained conditional generation in diffusion models. Specifically, it allows us to fully utilize existing or develop new conditional diffusion models that control specific aspects, and then aggregate them using the AMDM algorithm. This eliminates the need for constructing complex datasets, designing intricate model architectures, and incurring high training costs.

      <description>arXiv:2411.00626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent segmentation foundation model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), exhibits strong zero-shot segmentation capabilities, but it falls short in generating fine-grained precise masks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel zero-shot image matting model, called ZIM, with two key contributions: First, we develop a label converter that transforms segmentation labels into detailed matte labels, constructing the new SA1B-Matte dataset without costly manual annotations. Training SAM with this dataset enables it to generate precise matte masks while maintaining its zero-shot capability. Second, we design the zero-shot matting model equipped with a hierarchical pixel decoder to enhance mask representation, along with a prompt-aware masked attention mechanism to improve performance by enabling the model to focus on regions specified by visual prompts. We evaluate ZIM using the newly introduced MicroMat-3K test set, which contains high-quality micro-level matte labels. Experimental results show that ZIM outperforms existing methods in fine-grained mask generation and zero-shot generalization. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of ZIM in various downstream tasks requiring precise masks, such as image inpainting and 3D NeRF. Our contributions provide a robust foundation for advancing zero-shot matting and its downstream applications across a wide range of computer vision tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/naver-ai/ZIM.</description>

      <title>CogNav: Cognitive Process Modeling for Object Goal Navigation with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task in embodied AI, requiring an agent to locate a target object in previously unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and cognitive processes, including object recognition and decision-making. While substantial advancements in perception have been driven by the rapid development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate that our cognitive process modeling significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14% over the state-of-the-arts.</description>

      <title>T-Stars-Poster: A Framework for Product-Centric Advertising Image Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creating advertising images is often a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Can we automatically generate such images using basic product information like a product foreground image, taglines, and a target size? Existing methods mainly focus on parts of the problem and lack a comprehensive solution. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel product-centric framework for advertising image design called T-Stars-Poster. It consists of four sequential stages to highlight product foregrounds and taglines while achieving overall image aesthetics: prompt generation, layout generation, background image generation, and graphics rendering. Different expert models are designed and trained for the first three stages: First, a visual language model (VLM) generates background prompts that match the products. Next, a VLM-based layout generation model arranges the placement of product foregrounds, graphic elements (taglines and decorative underlays), and various nongraphic elements (objects from the background prompt). Following this, an SDXL-based model can simultaneously accept prompts, layouts, and foreground controls to generate images. To support T-Stars-Poster, we create two corresponding datasets with over 50,000 labeled images. Extensive experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate that T-Stars-Poster can produce more visually appealing advertising images.</description>

      <title>Language-to-Space Programming for Training-Free 3D Visual Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01401v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D visual grounding (3DVG) is challenging due to the need to understand 3D spatial relations. While supervised approaches have achieved superior performance, they are constrained by the scarcity and high annotation costs of 3D vision-language datasets. Training-free approaches based on LLMs/VLMs eliminate the need for large-scale training data, but they either incur prohibitive grounding time and token costs or have unsatisfactory accuracy. To address the challenges, we introduce a novel method for training-free 3D visual grounding, namely Language-to-Space Programming (LaSP). LaSP introduces LLM-generated codes to analyze 3D spatial relations among objects, along with a pipeline that evaluates and optimizes the codes automatically. Experimental results demonstrate that LaSP achieves 52.9% accuracy on the Nr3D benchmark, ranking among the best training-free methods. Moreover, it substantially reduces the grounding time and token costs, offering a balanced trade-off between performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Federated nnU-Net for Privacy-Preserving Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nnU-Net framework has played a crucial role in medical image segmentation and has become the gold standard in multitudes of applications targeting different diseases, organs, and modalities. However, so far it has been used primarily in a centralized approach where the collected data is stored in the same location where nnU-Net is trained. This centralized approach has various limitations, such as potential leakage of sensitive patient information and violation of patient privacy. Federated learning has emerged as a key approach for training segmentation models in a decentralized manner, enabling collaborative development while prioritising patient privacy. In this paper, we propose FednnU-Net, a plug-and-play, federated learning extension of the nnU-Net framework. To this end, we contribute two federated methodologies to unlock decentralized training of nnU-Net, namely, Federated Fingerprint Extraction (FFE) and Asymmetric Federated Averaging (AsymFedAvg). We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments demonstrating high and consistent performance of our methods for breast, cardiac and fetal segmentation based on a multi-modal collection of 6 datasets representing samples from 18 different institutions. To democratize research as well as real-world deployments of decentralized training in clinical centres, we publicly share our framework at https://github.com/faildeny/FednnUNet .</description>

      <title>Disentangled World Models: Learning to Transfer Semantic Knowledge from Distracting Videos for Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training visual reinforcement learning (RL) in practical scenarios presents a significant challenge, $\textit{i.e.,}$ RL agents suffer from low sample efficiency in environments with variations. While various approaches have attempted to alleviate this issue by disentangled representation learning, these methods usually start learning from scratch without prior knowledge of the world. This paper, in contrast, tries to learn and understand underlying semantic variations from distracting videos via offline-to-online latent distillation and flexible disentanglement constraints. To enable effective cross-domain semantic knowledge transfer, we introduce an interpretable model-based RL framework, dubbed Disentangled World Models (DisWM). Specifically, we pretrain the action-free video prediction model offline with disentanglement regularization to extract semantic knowledge from distracting videos. The disentanglement capability of the pretrained model is then transferred to the world model through latent distillation. For finetuning in the online environment, we exploit the knowledge from the pretrained model and introduce a disentanglement constraint to the world model. During the adaptation phase, the incorporation of actions and rewards from online environment interactions enriches the diversity of the data, which in turn strengthens the disentangled representation learning. Experimental results validate the superiority of our approach on various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Exploring Typographic Visual Prompts Injection Threats in Cross-Modality Generation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11519v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current Cross-Modality Generation Models (GMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in various generative tasks. Given the ubiquity and information richness of vision modality inputs in real-world scenarios, Cross-Vision tasks, encompassing Vision-Language Perception (VLP) and Image-to-Image (I2I), have attracted significant attention. Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and I2I Generation Models (GMs) are employed to handle VLP and I2I tasks, respectively. Previous research indicates that printing typographic words into input images significantly induces LVLMs and I2I GMs to produce disruptive outputs that are semantically aligned with those words. Additionally, visual prompts, as a more sophisticated form of typography, are also revealed to pose security risks to various applications of cross-vision tasks. However, the specific characteristics of the threats posed by visual prompts remain underexplored. In this paper, to comprehensively investigate the performance impact induced by Typographic Visual Prompt Injection (TVPI) in various LVLMs and I2I GMs, we propose the Typographic Visual Prompts Injection Dataset and thoroughly evaluate the TVPI security risks on various open-source and closed-source LVLMs and I2I GMs under visual prompts with different target semantics, deepening the understanding of TVPI threats.</description>

      <title>L2RW+: A Comprehensive Benchmark Towards Privacy-Preserved Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) is a challenging task that aims to match pedestrian images captured under varying lighting conditions, which has drawn intensive research attention and achieved promising results. However, existing methods adopt the centralized training, ignoring the potential privacy concerns as the data is distributed across multiple devices or entities in reality. In this paper, we propose L2RW+, a benchmark that brings VI-ReID closer to real-world applications. The core rationale behind L2RW+ is that incorporating decentralized training into VI-ReID can address privacy concerns in scenarios with limited data-sharing constrains. Specifically, we design protocols and corresponding algorithms for different privacy sensitivity levels. In our new benchmark, we simulate the training under real-world data conditions that: 1) data from each camera is completely isolated, or 2) different data entities (e.g., data controllers of a certain region) can selectively share the data. In this way, we simulate scenarios with strict privacy restrictions, which is closer to real-world conditions. Comprehensive experiments show the feasibility and potential of decentralized VI-ReID training at both image and video levels. In particular, with increasing data scales, the performance gap between decentralized and centralized training decreases, especially in video-level VI-ReID. In unseen domains, decentralized training even achieves performance comparable to SOTA centralized methods. This work offers a novel research entry for deploying VI-ReID into real-world scenarios and can benefit the community. Code is available at: https://github.com/Joey623/L2RW.</description>

      <title>WikiAutoGen: Towards Multi-Modal Wikipedia-Style Article Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge discovery and collection are intelligence-intensive tasks that traditionally require significant human effort to ensure high-quality outputs. Recent research has explored multi-agent frameworks for automating Wikipedia-style article generation by retrieving and synthesizing information from the internet. However, these methods primarily focus on text-only generation, overlooking the importance of multimodal content in enhancing informativeness and engagement. In this work, we introduce WikiAutoGen, a novel system for automated multimodal Wikipedia-style article generation. Unlike prior approaches, WikiAutoGen retrieves and integrates relevant images alongside text, enriching both the depth and visual appeal of generated content. To further improve factual accuracy and comprehensiveness, we propose a multi-perspective self-reflection mechanism, which critically assesses retrieved content from diverse viewpoints to enhance reliability, breadth, and coherence, etc. Additionally, we introduce WikiSeek, a benchmark comprising Wikipedia articles with topics paired with both textual and image-based representations, designed to evaluate multimodal knowledge generation on more challenging topics. Experimental results show that WikiAutoGen outperforms previous methods by 8%-29% on our WikiSeek benchmark, producing more accurate, coherent, and visually enriched Wikipedia-style articles. Our code and examples are available at https://wikiautogen.github.io/ .</description>

      <title>DSO: Aligning 3D Generators with Simulation Feedback for Physical Soundness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most 3D object generators prioritize aesthetic quality, often neglecting the physical constraints necessary for practical applications. One such constraint is that a 3D object should be self-supporting, i.e., remain balanced under gravity. Previous approaches to generating stable 3D objects relied on differentiable physics simulators to optimize geometry at test time, which is slow, unstable, and prone to local optima. Inspired by the literature on aligning generative models with external feedback, we propose Direct Simulation Optimization (DSO). This framework leverages feedback from a (non-differentiable) simulator to increase the likelihood that the 3D generator directly outputs stable 3D objects. We construct a dataset of 3D objects labeled with stability scores obtained from the physics simulator. This dataset enables fine-tuning of the 3D generator using the stability score as an alignment metric, via direct preference optimization (DPO) or direct reward optimization (DRO) - a novel objective we introduce to align diffusion models without requiring pairwise preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that the fine-tuned feed-forward generator, using either the DPO or DRO objective, is significantly faster and more likely to produce stable objects than test-time optimization. Notably, the DSO framework functions even without any ground-truth 3D objects for training, allowing the 3D generator to self-improve by automatically collecting simulation feedback on its own outputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce GeoTexBuild, a modular generative framework for creating 3D building models from footprints derived from site planning or map designs. The system is designed for architects and city planners, offering a seamless solution that directly converts map features into 3D buildings. The proposed framework employs a three-stage process comprising height map generation, geometry reconstruction, and appearance stylization, culminating in building models with detailed geometry and appearance attributes. By integrating customized ControlNet, Neural style field (NSF), and Multi-view diffusion model, we explore effective methods for controlling both geometric and visual attributes during the generation process. Our approach eliminates the problem of structural variations in a single facade image in existing 3D generation techniques for buildings. Experimental results at each stage validate the capability of GeoTexBuild to generate detailed and accurate building models from footprints.</description>

      <title>RSRNav: Reasoning Spatial Relationship for Image-Goal Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent image-goal navigation (ImageNav) methods learn a perception-action policy by separately capturing semantic features of the goal and egocentric images, then passing them to a policy network. However, challenges remain: (1) Semantic features often fail to provide accurate directional information, leading to superfluous actions, and (2) performance drops significantly when viewpoint inconsistencies arise between training and application. To address these challenges, we propose RSRNav, a simple yet effective method that reasons spatial relationships between the goal and current observations as navigation guidance. Specifically, we model the spatial relationship by constructing correlations between the goal and current observations, which are then passed to the policy network for action prediction. These correlations are progressively refined using fine-grained cross-correlation and direction-aware correlation for more precise navigation. Extensive evaluation of RSRNav on three benchmark datasets demonstrates superior navigation performance, particularly in the "user-matched goal" setting, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>When Memory Becomes a Vulnerability: Towards Multi-turn Jailbreak Attacks against Text-to-Image Generation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern text-to-image (T2I) generation systems (e.g., DALL$\cdot$E 3) exploit the memory mechanism, which captures key information in multi-turn interactions for faithful generation. Despite its practicality, the security analyses of this mechanism have fallen far behind. In this paper, we reveal that it can exacerbate the risk of jailbreak attacks. Previous attacks fuse the unsafe target prompt into one ultimate adversarial prompt, which can be easily detected or lead to the generation of non-unsafe images due to under- or over-detoxification. In contrast, we propose embedding the malice at the inception of the chat session in memory, addressing the above limitations.
  Specifically, we propose Inception, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack against real-world text-to-image generation systems that explicitly exploits their memory mechanisms. Inception is composed of two key modules: segmentation and recursion. We introduce Segmentation, a semantic-preserving method that generates multi-round prompts. By leveraging NLP analysis techniques, we design policies to decompose a prompt, together with its malicious intent, according to sentence structure, thereby evading safety filters. Recursion further addresses the challenge posed by unsafe sub-prompts that cannot be separated through simple segmentation. It firstly expands the sub-prompt, then invokes segmentation recursively. To facilitate multi-turn adversarial prompts crafting, we build VisionFlow, an emulation T2I system that integrates two-stage safety filters and industrial-grade memory mechanisms. The experiment results show that Inception successfully allures unsafe image generation, surpassing the SOTA by a 20.0\% margin in attack success rate. We also conduct experiments on the real-world commercial T2I generation platforms, further validating the threats of Inception in practice.</description>

      <title>DanceGRPO: Unleashing GRPO on Visual Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07818v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have revolutionized visual content creation, yet aligning model outputs with human preferences remains a critical challenge. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for fine-tuning generative models, existing methods like DDPO and DPOK face fundamental limitations - particularly their inability to maintain stable optimization when scaling to large and diverse prompt sets, severely restricting their practical utility. This paper presents DanceGRPO, a framework that addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for visual generation tasks. Our key insight is that GRPO's inherent stability mechanisms uniquely position it to overcome the optimization challenges that plague prior RL-based approaches on visual generation. DanceGRPO establishes several significant advances: First, it demonstrates consistent and stable policy optimization across multiple modern generative paradigms, including both diffusion models and rectified flows. Second, it maintains robust performance when scaling to complex, real-world scenarios encompassing three key tasks and four foundation models. Third, it shows remarkable versatility in optimizing for diverse human preferences as captured by five distinct reward models assessing image/video aesthetics, text-image alignment, video motion quality, and binary feedback. Our comprehensive experiments reveal that DanceGRPO outperforms baseline methods by up to 181\% across multiple established benchmarks, including HPS-v2.1, CLIP Score, VideoAlign, and GenEval. Our results establish DanceGRPO as a robust and versatile solution for scaling Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) tasks in visual generation, offering new insights into harmonizing reinforcement learning and visual synthesis.</description>

      <title>Relative Drawing Identification Complexity is Invariant to Modality in Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models have become multimodal, and many of them are said to integrate their modalities using common representations. If this were true, a drawing of a car as an image, for instance, should map to a similar area in the latent space as a textual description of the strokes that form the drawing. To explore this in a black-box access regime to these models, we propose the use of machine teaching, a theory that studies the minimal set of examples a teacher needs to choose so that the learner captures the concept. In this paper, we evaluate the complexity of teaching vision-language models a subset of objects in the Quick, Draw! dataset using two presentations: raw images as bitmaps and trace coordinates in TikZ format. The results indicate that image-based representations generally require fewer segments and achieve higher accuracy than coordinate-based representations. But, surprisingly, the teaching size usually ranks concepts similarly across both modalities, even when controlling for (a human proxy of) concept priors, suggesting that the simplicity of concepts may be an inherent property that transcends modality representations.</description>

      <title>Visual Perturbation and Adaptive Hard Negative Contrastive Learning for Compositional Reasoning in Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are essential for multimodal tasks, especially compositional reasoning (CR) tasks, which require distinguishing fine-grained semantic differences between visual and textual embeddings. However, existing methods primarily fine-tune the model by generating text-based hard negative samples, neglecting the importance of image-based negative samples, which results in insufficient training of the visual encoder and ultimately impacts the overall performance of the model. Moreover, negative samples are typically treated uniformly, without considering their difficulty levels, and the alignment of positive samples is insufficient, which leads to challenges in aligning difficult sample pairs. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Hard Negative Perturbation Learning (AHNPL). AHNPL translates text-based hard negatives into the visual domain to generate semantically disturbed image-based negatives for training the model, thereby enhancing its overall performance. AHNPL also introduces a contrastive learning approach using a multimodal hard negative loss to improve the model's discrimination of hard negatives within each modality and a dynamic margin loss that adjusts the contrastive margin according to sample difficulty to enhance the distinction of challenging sample pairs. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method effectively boosts VLMs' performance on complex CR tasks. The source code is available at https://github.com/nynu-BDAI/AHNPL.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses the task of assessing PICU team's leadership skills by developing an automated analysis framework based on egocentric vision. We identify key behavioral cues, including fixation object, eye contact, and conversation patterns, as essential indicators of leadership assessment. In order to capture these multimodal signals, we employ Aria Glasses to record egocentric video, audio, gaze, and head movement data. We collect one-hour videos of four simulated sessions involving doctors with different roles and levels. To automate data processing, we propose a method leveraging REMoDNaV, SAM, YOLO, and ChatGPT for fixation object detection, eye contact detection, and conversation classification. In the experiments, significant correlations are observed between leadership skills and behavioral metrics, i.e., the output of our proposed methods, such as fixation time, transition patterns, and direct orders in speech. These results indicate that our proposed data collection and analysis framework can effectively solve skill assessment for training PICU teams.</description>

      <title>Robust ID-Specific Face Restoration via Alignment Learning</title>

Abstract: The latest developments in Face Restoration have yielded significant advancements in visual quality through the utilization of diverse diffusion priors. Nevertheless, the uncertainty of face identity introduced by identity-obscure inputs and stochastic generative processes remains unresolved. To address this challenge, we present Robust ID-Specific Face Restoration (RIDFR), a novel ID-specific face restoration framework based on diffusion models. Specifically, RIDFR leverages a pre-trained diffusion model in conjunction with two parallel conditioning modules. The Content Injection Module inputs the severely degraded image, while the Identity Injection Module integrates the specific identity from a given image. Subsequently, RIDFR incorporates Alignment Learning, which aligns the restoration results from multiple references with the same identity in order to suppress the interference of ID-irrelevant face semantics (e.g. pose, expression, make-up, hair style). Experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, reconstructing high-quality ID-specific results with high identity fidelity and demonstrating strong robustness.</description>

      <title>InterAct-Video: Reasoning-Rich Video QA for Urban Traffic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic monitoring is crucial for urban mobility, road safety, and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Deep learning has advanced video-based traffic monitoring through video question answering (VideoQA) models, enabling structured insight extraction from traffic videos. However, existing VideoQA models struggle with the complexity of real-world traffic scenes, where multiple concurrent events unfold across spatiotemporal dimensions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \textbf{InterAct VideoQA}, a curated dataset designed to benchmark and enhance VideoQA models for traffic monitoring tasks. The InterAct VideoQA dataset comprises 8 hours of real-world traffic footage collected from diverse intersections, segmented into 10-second video clips, with over 25,000 question-answer (QA) pairs covering spatiotemporal dynamics, vehicle interactions, incident detection, and other critical traffic attributes. State-of-the-art VideoQA models are evaluated on InterAct VideoQA, exposing challenges in reasoning over fine-grained spatiotemporal dependencies within complex traffic scenarios. Additionally, fine-tuning these models on InterAct VideoQA yields notable performance improvements, demonstrating the necessity of domain-specific datasets for VideoQA. InterAct VideoQA is publicly available as a benchmark dataset to facilitate future research in real-world deployable VideoQA models for intelligent transportation systems.

      <title>When Tokens Talk Too Much: A Survey of Multimodal Long-Context Token Compression across Images, Videos, and Audios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20198v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides, largely driven by their ability to process increasingly long and complex contexts, such as high-resolution images, extended video sequences, and lengthy audio input. While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression. Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1) image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data; (2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based, and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain. We also maintain a public repository to continuously track and update the latest advances in this promising area.</description>

      <title>From Promise to Practical Reality: Transforming Diffusion MRI Analysis with Fast Deep Learning Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fiber orientation distribution (FOD) is an advanced diffusion MRI modeling technique that represents complex white matter fiber configurations, and a key step for subsequent brain tractography and connectome analysis. Its reliability and accuracy, however, heavily rely on the quality of the MRI acquisition and the subsequent estimation of the FODs at each voxel. Generating reliable FODs from widely available clinical protocols with single-shell and low-angular-resolution acquisitions remains challenging but could potentially be addressed with recent advances in deep learning-based enhancement techniques. Despite advancements, existing methods have predominantly been assessed on healthy subjects, which have proved to be a major hurdle for their clinical adoption. In this work, we validate a newly optimized enhancement framework, FastFOD-Net, across healthy controls and six neurological disorders. This accelerated end-to-end deep learning framework enhancing FODs with superior performance and delivering training/inference efficiency for clinical use ($60\times$ faster comparing to its predecessor). With the most comprehensive clinical evaluation to date, our work demonstrates the potential of FastFOD-Net in accelerating clinical neuroscience research, empowering diffusion MRI analysis for disease differentiation, improving interpretability in connectome applications, and reducing measurement errors to lower sample size requirements. Critically, this work will facilitate the more widespread adoption of, and build clinical trust in, deep learning based methods for diffusion MRI enhancement. Specifically, FastFOD-Net enables robust analysis of real-world, clinical diffusion MRI data, comparable to that achievable with high-quality research acquisitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates whether second-order geometric cues - planar curvature magnitude, curvature sign, and gradient orientation - are sufficient on their own to drive a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for handwritten character recognition (HCR), offering an alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using these three handcrafted feature maps as inputs, our curvature-orientation MLP achieves 97 percent accuracy on MNIST digits and 89 percent on EMNIST letters. These results underscore the discriminative power of curvature-based representations for handwritten character images and demonstrate that the advantages of deep learning can be realized even with interpretable, hand-engineered features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the classical Sobel operator to ask a simple question: Are first-order edge maps sufficient to drive an all-dense multilayer perceptron (MLP) for handwritten character recognition (HCR), as an alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs)? Using only horizontal and vertical Sobel derivatives as input, we train an MLP on MNIST and EMNIST Letters. Despite its extreme simplicity, the resulting network reaches 98% accuracy on MNIST digits and 92% on EMNIST letters -- approaching CNNs while offering a smaller memory footprint and transparent features. Our findings highlight that much of the class-discriminative information in handwritten character images is already captured by first-order gradients, making edge-aware MLPs a compelling option for HCR.</description>

      <title>SpecVLM: Enhancing Speculative Decoding of Video LLMs via Verifier-Guided Token Pruning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD) framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning. Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens to enable efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this, we performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner. Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$ decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for Qwen2.5-VL-32B. Code is available at https://github.com/zju-jiyicheng/SpecVLM.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Document VQA Models via Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants - text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR - across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the "concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring its practical value for real-world Document VQA.</description>

      <title>MIDAS: Multimodal Interactive Digital-humAn Synthesis via Real-time Autoregressive Video Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, interactive digital human video generation has attracted widespread attention and achieved remarkable progress. However, building such a practical system that can interact with diverse input signals in real time remains challenging to existing methods, which often struggle with heavy computational cost and limited controllability. In this work, we introduce an autoregressive video generation framework that enables interactive multimodal control and low-latency extrapolation in a streaming manner. With minimal modifications to a standard large language model (LLM), our framework accepts multimodal condition encodings including audio, pose, and text, and outputs spatially and semantically coherent representations to guide the denoising process of a diffusion head. To support this, we construct a large-scale dialogue dataset of approximately 20,000 hours from multiple sources, providing rich conversational scenarios for training. We further introduce a deep compression autoencoder with up to 64$\times$ reduction ratio, which effectively alleviates the long-horizon inference burden of the autoregressive model. Extensive experiments on duplex conversation, multilingual human synthesis, and interactive world model highlight the advantages of our approach in low latency, high efficiency, and fine-grained multimodal controllability.</description>

      <title>CVBench: Evaluating Cross-Video Synergies for Complex Multimodal Understanding and Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong performance on single-video tasks (e.g., video question answering), their ability across multiple videos remains critically underexplored. However, this capability is essential for real-world applications, including multi-camera surveillance and cross-video procedural learning. To bridge this gap, we present CVBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to assess cross-video relational reasoning rigorously. CVBench comprises 1,000 question-answer pairs spanning three hierarchical tiers: cross-video object association (identifying shared entities), cross-video event association (linking temporal or causal event chains), and cross-video complex reasoning (integrating commonsense and domain knowledge). Built from five domain-diverse video clusters (e.g., sports, life records), the benchmark challenges models to synthesise information across dynamic visual contexts. Extensive evaluation of 10+ leading MLLMs (including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-flash, Qwen2.5-VL) under zero-shot or chain-of-thought prompting paradigms. Key findings reveal stark performance gaps: even top models, such as GPT-4o, achieve only 60% accuracy on causal reasoning tasks, compared to the 91% accuracy of human performance. Crucially, our analysis reveals fundamental bottlenecks inherent in current MLLM architectures, notably deficient inter-video context retention and poor disambiguation of overlapping entities. CVBench establishes a rigorous framework for diagnosing and advancing multi-video reasoning, offering architectural insights for next-generation MLLMs. The data and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/Hokhim2/CVBench.</description>

      <title>Interact-Custom: Customized Human Object Interaction Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compositional Customized Image Generation aims to customize multiple target concepts within generation content, which has gained attention for its wild application. Existing approaches mainly concentrate on the target entity's appearance preservation, while neglecting the fine-grained interaction control among target entities. To enable the model of such interaction control capability, we focus on human object interaction scenario and propose the task of Customized Human Object Interaction Image Generation(CHOI), which simultaneously requires identity preservation for target human object and the interaction semantic control between them. Two primary challenges exist for CHOI:(1)simultaneous identity preservation and interaction control demands require the model to decompose the human object into self-contained identity features and pose-oriented interaction features, while the current HOI image datasets fail to provide ideal samples for such feature-decomposed learning.(2)inappropriate spatial configuration between human and object may lead to the lack of desired interaction semantics. To tackle it, we first process a large-scale dataset, where each sample encompasses the same pair of human object involving different interactive poses. Then we design a two-stage model Interact-Custom, which firstly explicitly models the spatial configuration by generating a foreground mask depicting the interaction behavior, then under the guidance of this mask, we generate the target human object interacting while preserving their identities features. Furthermore, if the background image and the union location of where the target human object should appear are provided by users, Interact-Custom also provides the optional functionality to specify them, offering high content controllability. Extensive experiments on our tailored metrics for CHOI task demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Video-LevelGauge: Investigating Contextual Positional Bias in Large Video Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large video language models (LVLMs) have made notable progress in video understanding, spurring the development of corresponding evaluation benchmarks. However, existing benchmarks generally assess overall performance across entire video sequences, overlooking nuanced behaviors such as contextual positional bias, a critical yet under-explored aspect of LVLM performance. We present Video-LevelGauge, a dedicated benchmark designed to systematically assess positional bias in LVLMs. We employ standardized probes and customized contextual setups, allowing flexible control over context length, probe position, and contextual types to simulate diverse real-world scenarios. In addition, we introduce a comprehensive analysis method that combines statistical measures with morphological pattern recognition to characterize bias. Our benchmark comprises 438 manually curated videos spanning multiple types, yielding 1,177 high-quality multiple-choice questions and 120 open-ended questions, validated for their effectiveness in exposing positional bias. Based on these, we evaluate 27 state-of-the-art LVLMs, including both commercial and open-source models. Our findings reveal significant positional biases in many leading open-source models, typically exhibiting head or neighbor-content preferences. In contrast, commercial models such as Gemini2.5-Pro show impressive, consistent performance across entire video sequences. Further analyses on context length, context variation, and model scale provide actionable insights for mitigating bias and guiding model enhancement.https://github.com/Cola-any/Video-LevelGauge</description>

      <title>Ego-centric Predictive Model Conditioned on Hand Trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In egocentric scenarios, anticipating both the next action and its visual outcome is essential for understanding human-object interactions and for enabling robotic planning. However, existing paradigms fall short of jointly modeling these aspects. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models focus on action prediction but lack explicit modeling of how actions influence the visual scene, while video prediction models generate future frames without conditioning on specific actions, often resulting in implausible or contextually inconsistent outcomes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified two-stage predictive framework that jointly models action and visual future in egocentric scenarios, conditioned on hand trajectories. In the first stage, we perform consecutive state modeling to process heterogeneous inputs (visual observations, language, and action history) and explicitly predict future hand trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce causal cross-attention to fuse multi-modal cues, leveraging inferred action signals to guide an image-based Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for frame-by-frame future video generation. Our approach is the first unified model designed to handle both egocentric human activity understanding and robotic manipulation tasks, providing explicit predictions of both upcoming actions and their visual consequences. Extensive experiments on Ego4D, BridgeData, and RLBench demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both action prediction and future video synthesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by humans comprehending speech in a multi-modal manner, various audio-visual datasets have been constructed. However, most existing datasets focus on English, induce dependencies with various prediction models during dataset preparation, and have only a small number of multi-view videos. To mitigate the limitations, we recently developed the Open Large-scale Korean Audio-Visual Speech (OLKAVS) dataset, which is the largest among publicly available audio-visual speech datasets. The dataset contains 1,150 hours of transcribed audio from 1,107 Korean speakers in a studio setup with nine different viewpoints and various noise situations. We also provide the pre-trained baseline models for two tasks, audio-visual speech recognition and lip reading. We conducted experiments based on the models to verify the effectiveness of multi-modal and multi-view training over uni-modal and frontal-view-only training. We expect the OLKAVS dataset to facilitate multi-modal research in broader areas such as Korean speech recognition, speaker recognition, pronunciation level classification, and mouth motion analysis.</description>

      <title>MTS-Net: Dual-Enhanced Positional Multi-Head Self-Attention for 3D CT Diagnosis of May-Thurner Syndrome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04680v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: May-Thurner Syndrome (MTS) is a vascular condition that affects over 20\% of the population and significantly increases the risk of iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis. Accurate and early diagnosis of MTS using computed tomography (CT) remains a clinical challenge due to the subtle anatomical compression and variability across patients. In this paper, we propose MTS-Net, an end-to-end 3D deep learning framework designed to capture spatial-temporal patterns from CT volumes for reliable MTS diagnosis. MTS-Net builds upon 3D ResNet-18 by embedding a novel dual-enhanced positional multi-head self-attention (DEP-MHSA) module into the Transformer encoder of the network's final stages. The proposed DEP-MHSA employs multi-scale convolution and integrates positional embeddings into both attention weights and residual paths, enhancing spatial context preservation, which is crucial for identifying venous compression. To validate our approach, we curate the first publicly available dataset for MTS, MTS-CT, containing over 747 gender-balanced subjects with standard and enhanced CT scans. Experimental results demonstrate that MTS-Net achieves average 0.79 accuracy, 0.84 AUC, and 0.78 F1-score, outperforming baseline models including 3D ResNet, DenseNet-BC, and BabyNet. Our work not only introduces a new diagnostic architecture for MTS but also provides a high-quality benchmark dataset to facilitate future research in automated vascular syndrome detection. We make our code and dataset publicly available at:https://github.com/Nutingnon/MTS_dep_mhsa.</description>

      <title>Unlearning Concepts from Text-to-Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of computer vision and natural language processing, text-to-video generation, enabled by text-to-video diffusion models, has become more prevalent. These models are trained using a large amount of data from the internet. However, the training data often contain copyrighted content, including cartoon character icons and artist styles, private portraits, and unsafe videos. Since filtering the data and retraining the model is challenging, methods for unlearning specific concepts from text-to-video diffusion models have been investigated. However, due to the high computational complexity and relative large optimization scale, there is little work on unlearning methods for text-to-video diffusion models. We propose a novel concept-unlearning method by transferring the unlearning capability of the text encoder of text-to-image diffusion models to text-to-video diffusion models. Specifically, the method optimizes the text encoder using few-shot unlearning, where several generated images are used. We then use the optimized text encoder in text-to-video diffusion models to generate videos. Our method costs low computation resources and has small optimization scale. We discuss the generated videos after unlearning a concept. The experiments demonstrates that our method can unlearn copyrighted cartoon characters, artist styles, objects and people's facial characteristics. Our method can unlearn a concept within about 100 seconds on an RTX 3070. Since there was no concept unlearning method for text-to-video diffusion models before, we make concept unlearning feasible and more accessible in the text-to-video domain.</description>

      <title>TGOSPA Metric Parameters Selection and Evaluation for Visual Multi-object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-object tracking algorithms are deployed in various applications, each with different performance requirements. For example, track switches pose significant challenges for offline scene understanding, as they hinder the accuracy of data interpretation. Conversely, in online surveillance applications, their impact is often minimal. This disparity underscores the need for application-specific performance evaluations that are both simple and mathematically sound. The trajectory generalized optimal sub-pattern assignment (TGOSPA) metric offers a principled approach to evaluate multi-object tracking performance. It accounts for localization errors, the number of missed and false objects, and the number of track switches, providing a comprehensive assessment framework. This paper illustrates the effective use of the TGOSPA metric in computer vision tasks, addressing challenges posed by the need for application-specific scoring methodologies. By exploring the TGOSPA parameter selection, we enable users to compare, comprehend, and optimize the performance of algorithms tailored for specific tasks, such as target tracking and training of detector or re-ID modules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents the IMPROVE dataset, a multimodal resource designed to evaluate the effects of mobile phone usage on learners during online education. It includes behavioral, biometric, physiological, and academic performance data collected from 120 learners divided into three groups with different levels of phone interaction, enabling the analysis of the impact of mobile phone usage and related phenomena such as nomophobia. A setup involving 16 synchronized sensors-including EEG, eye tracking, video cameras, smartwatches, and keystroke dynamics-was used to monitor learner activity during 30-minute sessions involving educational videos, document reading, and multiple-choice tests. Mobile phone usage events, including both controlled interventions and uncontrolled interactions, were labeled by supervisors and refined through a semi-supervised re-labeling process. Technical validation confirmed signal quality, and statistical analyses revealed biometric changes associated with phone usage. The dataset is publicly available for research through GitHub and Science Data Bank, with synchronized recordings from three platforms (edBB, edX, and LOGGE), provided in standard formats (.csv, .mp4, .wav, and .tsv), and accompanied by a detailed guide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces SMARTe-VR, a platform for student monitoring in an immersive virtual reality environment designed for online education. SMARTe-VR aims to collect data for adaptive learning, focusing on facial biometrics and learning metadata. The platform allows instructors to create customized learning sessions with video lectures, featuring an interface with an AutoQA system to evaluate understanding, interaction tools (for example, textbook highlighting and lecture tagging), and real-time feedback. Furthermore, we released a dataset that contains 5 research challenges with data from 10 users in VR-based TOEIC sessions. This data set, which spans more than 25 hours, includes facial features, learning metadata, 450 responses, difficulty levels of the questions, concept tags, and understanding labels. Alongside the database, we present preliminary experiments using Item Response Theory models, adapted for understanding detection using facial features. Two architectures were explored: a Temporal Convolutional Network for local features and a Multilayer Perceptron for global features.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Modeling of Jailbreak on Multimodal LLMs: From Quantification to Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06989v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their superior ability in understanding multimodal content. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which exploit weaknesses in their safety alignment to generate harmful responses. Previous studies categorize jailbreaks as successful or failed based on whether responses contain malicious content. However, given the stochastic nature of MLLM responses, this binary classification of an input's ability to jailbreak MLLMs is inappropriate. Derived from this viewpoint, we introduce jailbreak probability to quantify the jailbreak potential of an input, which represents the likelihood that MLLMs generated a malicious response when prompted with this input. We approximate this probability through multiple queries to MLLMs. After modeling the relationship between input hidden states and their corresponding jailbreak probability using Jailbreak Probability Prediction Network (JPPN), we use continuous jailbreak probability for optimization. Specifically, we propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Attack (JPA) that optimizes adversarial perturbations on input image to maximize jailbreak probability, and further enhance it as Multimodal JPA (MJPA) by including monotonic text rephrasing. To counteract attacks, we also propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Finetuning (JPF), which minimizes jailbreak probability through MLLM parameter updates. Extensive experiments show that (1) (M)JPA yields significant improvements when attacking a wide range of models under both white and black box settings. (2) JPF vastly reduces jailbreaks by at most over 60\%. Both of the above results demonstrate the significance of introducing jailbreak probability to make nuanced distinctions among input jailbreak abilities.</description>

      <title>HSM: Hierarchical Scene Motifs for Multi-Scale Indoor Scene Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite advances in indoor 3D scene layout generation, synthesizing scenes with dense object arrangements remains challenging. Existing methods focus on large furniture while neglecting smaller objects, resulting in unrealistically empty scenes. Those that place small objects typically do not honor arrangement specifications, resulting in largely random placement not following the text description. We present Hierarchical Scene Motifs (HSM): a hierarchical framework for indoor scene generation with dense object arrangements across spatial scales. Indoor scenes are inherently hierarchical, with surfaces supporting objects at different scales, from large furniture on floors to smaller objects on tables and shelves. HSM embraces this hierarchy and exploits recurring cross-scale spatial patterns to generate complex and realistic scenes in a unified manner. Our experiments show that HSM outperforms existing methods by generating scenes that better conform to user input across room types and spatial configurations.

      <title>Pixel Motion as Universal Representation for Robot Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present LangToMo, a vision-language-action framework structured as a dual-system architecture that uses pixel motion forecasts as intermediate representations. Our high-level System 2, an image diffusion model, generates text-conditioned pixel motion sequences from a single frame to guide robot control. Pixel motion-a universal, interpretable, and motion-centric representation-can be extracted from videos in a weakly-supervised manner, enabling diffusion model training on any video-caption data. Treating generated pixel motion as learned universal representations, our low level System 1 module translates these into robot actions via motion-to-action mapping functions, which can be either hand-crafted or learned with minimal supervision. System 2 operates as a high-level policy applied at sparse temporal intervals, while System 1 acts as a low-level policy at dense temporal intervals. This hierarchical decoupling enables flexible, scalable, and generalizable robot control under both unsupervised and supervised settings, bridging the gap between language, motion, and action.

      <title>TAG-WM: Tamper-Aware Generative Image Watermarking via Diffusion Inversion Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC) enables efficient visual creation but raises copyright and authenticity risks. As a common technique for integrity verification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a potential solution to above issues. However, the widespread adoption and advancing capabilities of generative image editing tools have amplified malicious tampering risks, while simultaneously posing new challenges to passive tampering detection and watermark robustness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative image WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key modules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright and localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative quality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a dense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion sensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and the tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results. The experimental results demonstrate that TAG-WM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tampering robustness and localization capability even under distortion, while preserving lossless generation quality and maintaining a watermark capacity of 256 bits. The code is available at: https://github.com/Suchenl/TAG-WM.</description>

      <title>Escaping Plato's Cave: JAM for Aligning Independently Trained Vision and Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01201v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Independently trained vision and language models inhabit disjoint representational spaces, shaped by their respective modalities, objectives, and architectures. The Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) suggests these models may nonetheless converge toward a shared statistical model of reality. This raises a fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc detection of such alignment and explicitly optimize for it? We argue this challenge is most critical in fine-grained contextual distinctions-where multiple descriptions share global semantics but differ in subtle compositional details. We address this with the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM), which aligns frozen unimodal models by jointly training modality-specific autoencoders with coordinated reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. We systematically evaluate JAM across three design axes: (i) alignment objectives, introducing our multimodal Spread Loss that outperforms classic contrastive methods; (ii) the layer depth at which alignment is most effective; and (iii) the role of foundation model scale in representational convergence. Our findings show that JAM reliably induces alignment even across independently trained representations, offering both theoretical insight into the structure of shared semantics and practical guidance for transforming generalist unimodal foundations into specialist multimodal models.</description>

      <title>DANCE: Resource-Efficient Neural Architecture Search with Data-Aware and Continuous Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful approach for automating neural network design. However, existing NAS methods face critical limitations in real-world deployments: architectures lack adaptability across scenarios, each deployment context requires costly separate searches, and performance consistency across diverse platforms remains challenging. We propose DANCE (Dynamic Architectures with Neural Continuous Evolution), which reformulates architecture search as a continuous evolution problem through learning distributions over architectural components. DANCE introduces three key innovations: a continuous architecture distribution enabling smooth adaptation, a unified architecture space with learned selection gates for efficient sampling, and a multi-stage training strategy for effective deployment optimization. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate DANCE's effectiveness. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NAS approaches in terms of accuracy while significantly reducing search costs. Under varying computational constraints, DANCE maintains robust performance while smoothly adapting architectures to different hardware requirements. The code and appendix can be found at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/DANCE.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Aware Detection of Fake Identity Documents: Methodology, Benchmark, and Improved Algorithms (FakeIDet2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote user verification in Internet-based applications is becoming increasingly important nowadays. A popular scenario for it consists of submitting a picture of the user's Identity Document (ID) to a service platform, authenticating its veracity, and then granting access to the requested digital service. An ID is well-suited to verify the identity of an individual, since it is government issued, unique, and nontransferable. However, with recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), attackers can surpass security measures in IDs and create very realistic physical and synthetic fake IDs. Researchers are now trying to develop methods to detect an ever-growing number of these AI-based fakes that are almost indistinguishable from authentic (bona fide) IDs. In this counterattack effort, researchers are faced with an important challenge: the difficulty in using real data to train fake ID detectors. This real data scarcity for research and development is originated by the sensitive nature of these documents, which are usually kept private by the ID owners (the users) and the ID Holders (e.g., government, police, bank, etc.). The main contributions of our study are: 1) We propose and discuss a patch-based methodology to preserve privacy in fake ID detection research. 2) We provide a new public database, FakeIDet2-db, comprising over 900K real/fake ID patches extracted from 2,000 ID images, acquired using different smartphone sensors, illumination and height conditions, etc. In addition, three physical attacks are considered: print, screen, and composite. 3) We present a new privacy-aware fake ID detection method, FakeIDet2. 4) We release a standard reproducible benchmark that considers physical and synthetic attacks from popular databases in the literature.</description>

      <title>Model-based Multi-object Visual Tracking: Identification and Standard Model Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper uses multi-object tracking methods known from the radar tracking community to address the problem of pedestrian tracking using 2D bounding box detections. The standard point-object (SPO) model is adopted, and the posterior density is computed using the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter. The selection of the model parameters rooted in continuous time is discussed, including the birth and survival probabilities. Some parameters are selected from the first principles, while others are identified from the data, which is, in this case, the publicly available MOT-17 dataset. Although the resulting PMBM algorithm yields promising results, a mismatch between the SPO model and the data is revealed. The model-based approach assumes that modifying the problematic components causing the SPO model-data mismatch will lead to better model-based algorithms in future developments.</description>

      <title>Seeing is Believing: Emotion-Aware Audio-Visual Language Modeling for Expressive Speech Generation</title>

Abstract: We present an Audio-Visual Language Model (AVLM) for expressive speech generation by integrating full-face visual cues into a pre-trained expressive speech model. We explore multiple visual encoders and multimodal fusion strategies during pre-training to identify the most effective integration approach. Subsequent fine-tuning on emotion recognition and expressive dialogue tasks yields substantial gains over speech-only baselines (e.g., +5 F1 in emotion recognition). AVLM highlights the value of expressive visual information in guiding speech generation and offers a foundation for end-to-end multimodal conversational systems.</description>
