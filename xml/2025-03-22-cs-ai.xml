      <title>Cosmos-Reason1: From Physical Common Sense To Embodied Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical AI systems need to perceive, understand, and perform complex actions in the physical world. In this paper, we present the Cosmos-Reason1 models that can understand the physical world and generate appropriate embodied decisions (e.g., next step action) in natural language through long chain-of-thought reasoning processes. We begin by defining key capabilities for Physical AI reasoning, with a focus on physical common sense and embodied reasoning. To represent physical common sense, we use a hierarchical ontology that captures fundamental knowledge about space, time, and physics. For embodied reasoning, we rely on a two-dimensional ontology that generalizes across different physical embodiments. Building on these capabilities, we develop two multimodal large language models, Cosmos-Reason1-8B and Cosmos-Reason1-56B. We curate data and train our models in four stages: vision pre-training, general supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Physical AI SFT, and Physical AI reinforcement learning (RL) as the post-training. To evaluate our models, we build comprehensive benchmarks for physical common sense and embodied reasoning according to our ontologies. Evaluation results show that Physical AI SFT and reinforcement learning bring significant improvements. To facilitate the development of Physical AI, we will make our code and pre-trained models available under the NVIDIA Open Model License at https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason1.</description>

      <title>How Well Can AI Build SD Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: As system dynamics (SD) embraces automation, AI offers efficiency but risks bias from missing data and flawed models. Models that omit multiple perspectives and data threaten model quality, whether created by humans or with the assistance of AI. To reduce uncertainty about how well AI can build SD models, we introduce two metrics for evaluation of AI-generated causal maps: technical correctness (causal translation) and adherence to instructions (conformance).
  Approach: We developed an open source project called sd-ai to provide a basis for collaboration in the SD community, aiming to fully harness the potential of AI based tools like ChatGPT for dynamic modeling. Additionally, we created an evaluation theory along with a comprehensive suite of tests designed to evaluate any such tools developed within the sd-ai ecosystem.
  Results: We tested 11 different LLMs on their ability to do causal translation as well as conform to user instruction. gpt-4.5-preview was the top performer, scoring 92.9% overall, excelling in both tasks. o1 scored 100% in causal translation. gpt-4o identified all causal links but struggled with positive polarity in decreasing terms. While gpt-4.5-preview and o1 are most accurate, gpt-4o is the cheapest.
  Discussion: Causal translation and conformance tests applied to the sd-ai engine reveal significant variations across lLLMs, underscoring the need for continued evaluation to ensure responsible development of AI tools for dynamic modeling. To address this, an open collaboration among tool developers, modelers, and stakeholders is launched to standardize measures for evaluating the capacity of AI tools to improve the modeling process.</description>

      <title>R$^2$: A LLM Based Novel-to-Screenplay Generation Framework with Causal Plot Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatically adapting novels into screenplays is important for the TV, film, or opera industries to promote products with low costs. The strong performances of large language models (LLMs) in long-text generation call us to propose a LLM based framework Reader-Rewriter (R$^2$) for this task. However, there are two fundamental challenges here. First, the LLM hallucinations may cause inconsistent plot extraction and screenplay generation. Second, the causality-embedded plot lines should be effectively extracted for coherent rewriting. Therefore, two corresponding tactics are proposed: 1) A hallucination-aware refinement method (HAR) to iteratively discover and eliminate the affections of hallucinations; and 2) a causal plot-graph construction method (CPC) based on a greedy cycle-breaking algorithm to efficiently construct plot lines with event causalities. Recruiting those efficient techniques, R$^2$ utilizes two modules to mimic the human screenplay rewriting process: The Reader module adopts a sliding window and CPC to build the causal plot graphs, while the Rewriter module generates first the scene outlines based on the graphs and then the screenplays. HAR is integrated into both modules for accurate inferences of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of R$^2$, which substantially outperforms three existing approaches (51.3%, 22.6%, and 57.1% absolute increases) in pairwise comparison at the overall win rate for GPT-4o.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Environment with LLM-Controlled Adversary in D&amp;D 5th Edition Combat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this study is to design and implement a reinforcement learning (RL) environment using D\&amp;D 5E combat scenarios to challenge smaller RL agents through interaction with a robust adversarial agent controlled by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and LLaMA 3 8B. This research employs Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for the smaller agents, creating a testbed for strategic AI development that also serves as an educational tool by simulating dynamic and unpredictable combat scenarios. We successfully integrated sophisticated language models into the RL framework, enhancing strategic decision-making processes. Our results indicate that while RL agents generally outperform LLM-controlled adversaries in standard metrics, the strategic depth provided by LLMs significantly enhances the overall AI capabilities in this complex, rule-based setting. The novelty of our approach and its implications for mastering intricate environments and developing adaptive strategies are discussed, alongside potential innovations in AI-driven interactive simulations. This paper aims to demonstrate how integrating LLMs can create more robust and adaptable AI systems, providing valuable insights for further research and educational applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ECLAIR (Enhanced CLArification for Interactive Responses), a novel unified and end-to-end framework for interactive disambiguation in enterprise AI assistants. ECLAIR generates clarification questions for ambiguous user queries and resolves ambiguity based on the user's response.We introduce a generalized architecture capable of integrating ambiguity information from multiple downstream agents, enhancing context-awareness in resolving ambiguities and allowing enterprise specific definition of agents. We further define agents within our system that provide domain-specific grounding information. We conduct experiments comparing ECLAIR to few-shot prompting techniques and demonstrate ECLAIR's superior performance in clarification question generation and ambiguity resolution.</description>

      <title>Using Language Models to Decipher the Motivation Behind Human Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI presents a novel tool for deciphering the motivations behind human behaviors. We show that by varying prompts to a large language model, we can elicit a full range of human behaviors in a variety of different scenarios in terms of classic economic games. Then by analyzing which prompts are needed to elicit which behaviors, we can infer (decipher) the motivations behind the human behaviors. We also show how one can analyze the prompts to reveal relationships between the classic economic games, providing new insight into what different economic scenarios induce people to think about. We also show how this deciphering process can be used to understand differences in the behavioral tendencies of different populations.</description>

      <title>Dialogic Learning in Child-Robot Interaction: A Hybrid Approach to Personalized Educational Content Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dialogic learning fosters motivation and deeper understanding in education through purposeful and structured dialogues. Foundational models offer a transformative potential for child-robot interactions, enabling the design of personalized, engaging, and scalable interactions. However, their integration into educational contexts presents challenges in terms of ensuring age-appropriate and safe content and alignment with pedagogical goals. We introduce a hybrid approach to designing personalized educational dialogues in child-robot interactions. By combining rule-based systems with LLMs for selective offline content generation and human validation, the framework ensures educational quality and developmental appropriateness. We illustrate this approach through a project aimed at enhancing reading motivation, in which a robot facilitated book-related dialogues.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of video-language pretraining, existing models face numerous challenges in terms of inference efficiency and multimodal data processing. This paper proposes a KunLunBaize-VoT-R1 video inference model based on a long-sequence image encoder, along with its training and application methods. By integrating image packing technology, the Autonomy-of-Experts (AoE) architecture, and combining the video of Thought (VoT), a large language model (LLM) trained with large-scale reinforcement learning, and multiple training techniques, the efficiency and accuracy of the model in video inference tasks are effectively improved. Experiments show that this model performs outstandingly in multiple tests, providing a new solution for video-language understanding.</description>

      <title>Attention Pruning: Automated Fairness Repair of Language Models via Surrogate Simulated Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores pruning attention heads as a post-processing bias mitigation method for large language models (LLMs). Modern AI systems such as LLMs are expanding into sensitive social contexts where fairness concerns become especially crucial. Since LLMs develop decision-making patterns by training on massive datasets of human-generated content, they naturally encode and perpetuate societal biases. While modifying training datasets and algorithms is expensive and requires significant resources; post-processing techniques-such as selectively deactivating neurons and attention heads in pre-trained LLMs-can provide feasible and effective approaches to improve fairness. However, identifying the optimal subset of parameters to prune presents a combinatorial challenge within LLMs' immense parameter space, requiring solutions that efficiently balance competing objectives across the frontiers of model fairness and utility.
  To address the computational challenges, we explore a search-based program repair approach via randomized simulated annealing. Given the prohibitive evaluation costs in billion-parameter LLMs, we develop surrogate deep neural networks that efficiently model the relationship between attention head states (active/inactive) and their corresponding fairness/utility metrics. This allows us to perform optimization over the surrogate models and efficiently identify optimal subsets of attention heads for selective pruning rather than directly searching through the LLM parameter space. This paper introduces Attention Pruning, a fairness-aware surrogate simulated annealing approach to prune attention heads in LLMs that disproportionately contribute to bias while minimally impacting overall model utility. Our experiments show that Attention Pruning achieves up to $40\%$ reduction in gender bias and outperforms the state-of-the-art bias mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Ranking Counterfactual Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-driven outcomes can be challenging for end-users to understand. Explanations can address two key questions: "Why this outcome?" (factual) and "Why not another?" (counterfactual). While substantial efforts have been made to formalize factual explanations, a precise and comprehensive study of counterfactual explanations is still lacking. This paper proposes a formal definition of counterfactual explanations, proving some properties they satisfy, and examining the relationship with factual explanations. Given that multiple counterfactual explanations generally exist for a specific case, we also introduce a rigorous method to rank these counterfactual explanations, going beyond a simple minimality condition, and to identify the optimal ones. Our experiments with 12 real-world datasets highlight that, in most cases, a single optimal counterfactual explanation emerges. We also demonstrate, via three metrics, that the selected optimal explanation exhibits higher representativeness and can explain a broader range of elements than a random minimal counterfactual. This result highlights the effectiveness of our approach in identifying more robust and comprehensive counterfactual explanations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Local Selection: Global Cut Selection for Enhanced Mixed-Integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mixed-integer programming (MIP) solvers, cutting planes are essential for Branch-and-Cut (B&amp;C) algorithms as they reduce the search space and accelerate the solving process. Traditional methods rely on hard-coded heuristics for cut plane selection but fail to leverage problem-specific structural features. Recent machine learning approaches use neural networks for cut selection but focus narrowly on the efficiency of single-node within the B&amp;C algorithm, without considering the broader contextual information. To address this, we propose Global Cut Selection (GCS), which uses a bipartite graph to represent the search tree and combines graph neural networks with reinforcement learning to develop cut selection strategies. Unlike prior methods, GCS applies cutting planes across all nodes, incorporating richer contextual information. Experiments show GCS significantly improves solving efficiency for synthetic and large-scale real-world MIPs compared to traditional and learning-based methods.</description>

      <title>Entropy-based Exploration Conduction for Multi-step Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In large language model (LLM) reasoning, multi-step processes have proven effective for solving complex tasks. However, the depth of exploration can significantly affect the reasoning performance. Existing methods to automatically decide the depth often bring high costs and lack flexibility, and thus undermine the model's reasoning accuracy. To address these issues, we propose Entropy-based Exploration Depth Conduction (Entro-duction), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the exploration depth during multi-step reasoning by monitoring LLM's output entropy and variance entropy. We employ these two metrics to capture the model's current uncertainty and the fluctuation of uncertainty across consecutive reasoning steps. Based on the observed changes, the LLM selects whether to deepen, expand or stop exploration according to the probability. In this way, we balance the reasoning accuracy and exploration effectiveness. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of Entro-duction. We further conduct experiments and analysis on the components of Entro-duction to discuss their contributions to reasoning performance.</description>

      <title>DeepPsy-Agent: A Stage-Aware and Deep-Thinking Emotional Support Agent System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces DeepPsy-Agent, an innovative psychological support system that combines the three-stage helping theory in psychology with deep learning techniques. The system consists of two core components: (1) a multi-stage response-capable dialogue model (\textit{deeppsy-chat}), which enhances reasoning capabilities through stage-awareness and deep-thinking analysis to generate high-quality responses; and (2) a real-time stage transition detection model that identifies contextual shifts to guide the dialogue towards more effective intervention stages. Based on 30,000 real psychological hotline conversations, we employ AI-simulated dialogues and expert re-annotation strategies to construct a high-quality multi-turn dialogue dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepPsy-Agent outperforms general-purpose large language models (LLMs) in key metrics such as problem exposure completeness, cognitive restructuring success rate, and action adoption rate. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of stage-awareness and deep-thinking modules, showing that stage information contributes 42.3\% to performance, while the deep-thinking module increases root-cause identification by 58.3\% and reduces ineffective suggestions by 72.1\%. This system addresses critical challenges in AI-based psychological support through dynamic dialogue management and deep reasoning, advancing intelligent mental health services.</description>

      <title>Advancing Mobile GUI Agents: A Verifier-Driven Approach to Practical Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose V-Droid, a mobile GUI task automation agent. Unlike previous mobile agents that utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) as generators to directly generate actions at each step, V-Droid employs LLMs as verifiers to evaluate candidate actions before making final decisions. To realize this novel paradigm, we introduce a comprehensive framework for constructing verifier-driven mobile agents: the discretized action space construction coupled with the prefilling-only workflow to accelerate the verification process, the pair-wise progress preference training to significantly enhance the verifier's decision-making capabilities, and the scalable human-agent joint annotation scheme to efficiently collect the necessary data at scale. V-Droid sets a new state-of-the-art task success rate across several public mobile task automation benchmarks: 59.5% on AndroidWorld, 38.3% on AndroidLab, and 49% on MobileAgentBench, surpassing existing agents by 9.5%, 2.1%, and 9%, respectively. Furthermore, V-Droid achieves an impressively low latency of 0.7 seconds per step, making it the first mobile agent capable of delivering near-real-time, effective decision-making capabilities.</description>

Unreal-MAP allows users to freely create multi-agent tasks using the vast visual and physical resources available in the UE community, and deploy state-of-the-art (SOTA) MARL algorithms within them. Unreal-MAP is user-friendly in terms of deployment, modification, and visualization, and all its components are open-source. We also develop an experimental framework compatible with algorithms ranging from rule-based to learning-based provided by third-party frameworks. Lastly, we deploy several SOTA algorithms in example tasks developed via Unreal-MAP, and conduct corresponding experimental analyses. We believe Unreal-MAP can play an important role in the MARL field by closely integrating existing algorithms with user-customized tasks, thus advancing the field of MARL.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Reliability of Self-explanation and its Relationship with Classification in Language Model-driven Financial Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) have exhibited exceptional versatility in reasoning and in-depth financial analysis through their proprietary information processing capabilities. Previous research focused on evaluating classification performance while often overlooking explainability or pre-conceived that refined explanation corresponds to higher classification accuracy. Using a public dataset in finance domain, we quantitatively evaluated self-explanations by LMs, focusing on their factuality and causality. We identified the statistically significant relationship between the accuracy of classifications and the factuality or causality of self-explanations. Our study built an empirical foundation for approximating classification confidence through self-explanations and for optimizing classification via proprietary reasoning.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Water Distribution Systems Modeling and Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design, operations, and management of water distribution systems (WDS) involve complex mathematical models. These models are continually improving due to computational advancements, leading to better decision-making and more efficient WDS management. However, the significant time and effort required for modeling, programming, and analyzing results remain substantial challenges. Another issue is the professional burden, which confines the interaction with models, databases, and other sophisticated tools to a small group of experts, thereby causing non-technical stakeholders to depend on these experts or make decisions without modeling support. Furthermore, explaining model results is challenging even for experts, as it is often unclear which conditions cause the model to reach a certain state or recommend a specific policy. The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) open doors for a new stage in human-model interaction. This study proposes a framework of plain language interactions with hydraulic and water quality models based on LLM-EPANET architecture. This framework is tested with increasing levels of complexity of queries to study the ability of LLMs to interact with WDS models, run complex simulations, and report simulation results. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated across several categories of queries and hyper-parameter configurations, demonstrating its potential to enhance decision-making processes in WDS management.</description>

      <title>Logic Explanation of AI Classifiers by Categorical Explaining Functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most common methods in explainable artificial intelligence are post-hoc techniques which identify the most relevant features used by pretrained opaque models. Some of the most advanced post hoc methods can generate explanations that account for the mutual interactions of input features in the form of logic rules. However, these methods frequently fail to guarantee the consistency of the extracted explanations with the model's underlying reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose a theoretically grounded approach to ensure coherence and fidelity of the extracted explanations, moving beyond the limitations of current heuristic-based approaches. To this end, drawing from category theory, we introduce an explaining functor which structurally preserves logical entailment between the explanation and the opaque model's reasoning. As a proof of concept, we validate the proposed theoretical constructions on a synthetic benchmark verifying how the proposed approach significantly mitigates the generation of contradictory or unfaithful explanations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (LLMs) has opened new frontiers in artificial intelligence, enabling the integration of diverse large-scale data types such as text, images, and spatial information. In this paper, we explore the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLM) for geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), a field that leverages spatial data to address challenges in domains including Geospatial Semantics, Health Geography, Urban Geography, Urban Perception, and Remote Sensing. We propose a MLLM (OmniGeo) tailored to geospatial applications, capable of processing and analyzing heterogeneous data sources, including satellite imagery, geospatial metadata, and textual descriptions. By combining the strengths of natural language understanding and spatial reasoning, our model enhances the ability of instruction following and the accuracy of GeoAI systems. Results demonstrate that our model outperforms task-specific models and existing LLMs on diverse geospatial tasks, effectively addressing the multimodality nature while achieving competitive results on the zero-shot geospatial tasks. Our code will be released after publication.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Software Quality Assurance with an Adaptive Differential Evolution based Quantum Variational Autoencoder-Transformer Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An AI-powered quality engineering platform uses artificial intelligence to boost software quality assessments through automated defect prediction and optimized performance alongside improved feature extraction. Existing models result in difficulties addressing noisy data types together with imbalances, pattern recognition complexities, ineffective feature extraction, and generalization weaknesses. To overcome those existing challenges in this research, we develop a new model Adaptive Differential Evolution based Quantum Variational Autoencoder-Transformer Model (ADE-QVAET), that combines a Quantum Variational Autoencoder-Transformer (QVAET) to obtain high-dimensional latent features and maintain sequential dependencies together with contextual relationships, resulting in superior defect prediction accuracy. Adaptive Differential Evolution (ADE) Optimization utilizes an adaptive parameter tuning method that enhances model convergence and predictive performance. ADE-QVAET integrates advanced AI techniques to create a robust solution for scalable and accurate software defect prediction that represents a top-level AI-driven technology for quality engineering applications. The proposed ADE-QVAET model attains high accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score during the training percentage (TP) 90 of 98.08%, 92.45%, 94.67%, and 98.12%.</description>

Abstract: Is it possible to articulate a conception of consciousness that is compatible with the exotic characteristics of contemporary, disembodied AI systems, and that can stand up to philosophical scrutiny? How would subjective time and selfhood show up for an entity that conformed to such a conception? Trying to answer these questions, even metaphorically, stretches the language of consciousness to breaking point. Ultimately, the attempt yields something like emptiness, in the Buddhist sense, and helps to undermine our dualistic inclinations towards subjectivity and selfhood.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-based Heuristics to Guide Domain-Independent Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain-Independent Dynamic Programming (DIDP) is a state-space search paradigm based on dynamic programming for combinatorial optimization. In its current implementation, DIDP guides the search using user-defined dual bounds. Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly being applied to combinatorial optimization problems and shares several key structures with DP, being represented by the Bellman equation and state-based transition systems. We propose using reinforcement learning to obtain a heuristic function to guide the search in DIDP. We develop two RL-based guidance approaches: value-based guidance using Deep Q-Networks and policy-based guidance using Proximal Policy Optimization. Our experiments indicate that RL-based guidance significantly outperforms standard DIDP and problem-specific greedy heuristics with the same number of node expansions. Further, despite longer node evaluation times, RL guidance achieves better run-time performance than standard DIDP on three of four benchmark domains.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing Long Chain-of-Thought: A Structured Reasoning Optimization Framework for Long CoT Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities through long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. The R1 distillation scheme has emerged as a promising approach for training cost-effective models with enhanced reasoning abilities. However, the underlying mechanisms driving its effectiveness remain unclear. This study examines the universality of distillation data and identifies key components that enable the efficient transfer of long-chain reasoning capabilities in LLM distillation. Our findings reveal that the effectiveness of long CoT reasoning distillation from teacher models like Qwen-QwQ degrades significantly on nonhomologous models, challenging the assumed universality of current distillation methods. To gain deeper insights into the structure and patterns of long CoT reasoning, we propose DLCoT (Deconstructing Long Chain-of-Thought), a distillation data enhancement framework. DLCoT consists of three key steps: (1) data segmentation to decompose complex long CoT structures, (2) simplification by eliminating unsolvable and redundant solutions, and (3) optimization of intermediate error states. Our approach significantly improves model performance and token efficiency, facilitating the development of high-performance LLMs.</description>

      <title>The Emperor's New Clothes in Benchmarking? A Rigorous Examination of Mitigation Strategies for LLM Benchmark Data Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmark Data Contamination (BDC)-the inclusion of benchmark testing samples in the training set-has raised increasing concerns in Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation, leading to falsely inflated performance estimates and undermining evaluation reliability. To address this, researchers have proposed various mitigation strategies to update existing benchmarks, including modifying original questions or generating new ones based on them. However, a rigorous examination of the effectiveness of these mitigation strategies remains lacking. In this paper, we design a systematic and controlled pipeline along with two novel metrics-fidelity and contamination resistance-to provide a fine-grained and comprehensive assessment of existing BDC mitigation strategies. Previous assessment methods, such as accuracy drop and accuracy matching, focus solely on aggregate accuracy, often leading to incomplete or misleading conclusions. Our metrics address this limitation by emphasizing question-level evaluation result matching. Extensive experiments with 10 LLMs, 5 benchmarks, 20 BDC mitigation strategies, and 2 contamination scenarios reveal that no existing strategy significantly improves resistance over the vanilla case (i.e., no benchmark update) across all benchmarks, and none effectively balances fidelity and contamination resistance. These findings underscore the urgent need for designing more effective BDC mitigation strategies. Our code repository is available at https://github.com/ASTRAL-Group/BDC_mitigation_assessment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of LLM-based agents represents a paradigm shift in AI, enabling autonomous systems to plan, reason, use tools, and maintain memory while interacting with dynamic environments. This paper provides the first comprehensive survey of evaluation methodologies for these increasingly capable agents. We systematically analyze evaluation benchmarks and frameworks across four critical dimensions: (1) fundamental agent capabilities, including planning, tool use, self-reflection, and memory; (2) application-specific benchmarks for web, software engineering, scientific, and conversational agents; (3) benchmarks for generalist agents; and (4) frameworks for evaluating agents. Our analysis reveals emerging trends, including a shift toward more realistic, challenging evaluations with continuously updated benchmarks. We also identify critical gaps that future research must address-particularly in assessing cost-efficiency, safety, and robustness, and in developing fine-grained, and scalable evaluation methods. This survey maps the rapidly evolving landscape of agent evaluation, reveals the emerging trends in the field, identifies current limitations, and proposes directions for future research.</description>

      <title>World of ScoreCraft: Novel Multi Scorer Experiment on the Impact of a Decision Support System in Sleep Staging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manual scoring of polysomnography (PSG) is a time intensive task, prone to inter scorer variability that can impact diagnostic reliability. This study investigates the integration of decision support systems (DSS) into PSG scoring workflows, focusing on their effects on accuracy, scoring time, and potential biases toward recommendations from artificial intelligence (AI) compared to human generated recommendations. Using a novel online scoring platform, we conducted a repeated measures study with sleep technologists,
  who scored traditional and self applied PSGs. Participants were occasionally presented with recommendations labeled as either human or AI generated. We found that traditional PSGs tended to be scored slightly more accurately than self applied PSGs, but this difference was not statistically significant. Correct recommendations significantly improved scoring accuracy for both PSG types, while incorrect recommendations reduced accuracy. No significant bias was observed toward or against AI generated recommendations compared to human generated recommendations. These findings highlight the potential of AI to enhance PSG scoring reliability. However, ensuring the accuracy of AI outputs is critical to maximizing its benefits. Future research should explore the long term impacts of DSS on scoring workflows and strategies for integrating AI in clinical practice.</description>

Abstract: F\"ur eine fr\"uhzeitige Erkennung von Lieferengp\"assen m\"ussen Lieferketten in einer geeigneten digitalen Form vorliegen, damit sie verarbeitet werden k\"onnen. Der f\"ur die Datenmodellierung ben\"otigte Arbeitsaufwand ist jedoch, gerade IT-fremden Personen, nicht zuzumuten. Es wurde deshalb im Rahmen dieser Arbeit eine Webanwendung entwickelt, welche die zugrunde liegende Komplexit\"at f\"ur den Benutzer verschleiern soll. Konkret handelt es sich dabei um eine grafische Benutzeroberfl\"ache, auf welcher Templates instanziiert und miteinander verkn\"upft werden k\"onnen. F\"ur die Definition dieser Templates wurden in dieser Arbeit geeignete Konzepte erarbeitet und erweitert. Zur Erhebung der Benutzerfreundlichkeit der Webanwendung wurde abschlie{\ss}end eine Nutzerstudie mit mehreren Testpersonen durchgef\"uhrt. Diese legte eine Vielzahl von n\"utzlichen Verbesserungsvorschl\"agen offen.

  For early detection of supply bottlenecks, supply chains must be available in a suitable digital form so that they can be processed. However, the amount of work required for data modeling cannot be expected of people who are not familiar with IT topics. Therefore, a web application was developed in the context of this thesis, which is supposed to disguise the underlying complexity for the user. Specifically, this is a graphical user interface on which templates can be instantiated and linked to each other. Suitable concepts for the definition of these templates were developed and extended in this thesis. Finally, a user study with several test persons was conducted to determine the usability of the web application. This revealed a large number of useful suggestions for improvement.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Big Five Personality Traits on AI Agent Decision-Making in Public Spaces: A Social Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates how the Big Five personality traits influence decision-making processes in AI agents within public spaces. Using AgentVerse framework and GPT-3.5-turbo, we simulated interactions among 10 AI agents, each embodying different dimensions of the Big Five personality traits, in a classroom environment responding to misinformation. The experiment assessed both public expressions ([Speak]) and private thoughts ([Think]) of agents, revealing significant correlations between personality traits and decision-making patterns. Results demonstrate that Openness to Experience had the strongest impact on information acceptance, with curious agents showing high acceptance rates and cautious agents displaying strong skepticism. Extraversion and Conscientiousness also showed notable influence on decision-making, while Neuroticism and Agreeableness exhibited more balanced responses. Additionally, we observed significant discrepancies between public expressions and private thoughts, particularly in agents with friendly and extroverted personalities, suggesting that social context influences decision-making behavior. Our findings contribute to understanding how personality traits shape AI agent behavior in social settings and have implications for developing more nuanced and context-aware AI systems.</description>

Abstract: Revival is an innovative live audiovisual performance and music improvisation by our artist collective K-Phi-A, blending human and AI musicianship to create electronic music with audio-reactive visuals. The performance features real-time co-creative improvisation between a percussionist, an electronic music artist, and AI musical agents. Trained in works by deceased composers and the collective's compositions, these agents dynamically respond to human input and emulate complex musical styles. An AI-driven visual synthesizer, guided by a human VJ, produces visuals that evolve with the musical landscape. Revival showcases the potential of AI and human collaboration in improvisational artistic creation.</description>

      <title>Approach to Visual Attractiveness of Event Space Through Data-Driven Environment and Spatial Perception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Revitalizing Japan's remote areas has become a crucial task, and Matsue City exemplifies this effort in its temporary event spaces, created through collective efforts to foster urban vibrancy and bring together residents and visitors. This research examines the relationship between data-driven in-sights using generative AI and visual attractiveness by evaluating tempo-rary events in Matsue City, particularly considering the cognitive-cultural differences in processing visual information of the participants. The first phase employs semantic keyword extraction from interviews, categorizing responses into physical elements, activities, and atmosphere. The second phase analyzes spatial perception through three categories: layout hierar-chy, product visibility, and visual attention. The correlation indicates that successful event design requires a balance between spatial efficiency and diverse needs, with a spatial organization that optimizes visitor flow and visibility strategies considering cultural and demographic diversity. These findings contribute to understanding the urban quality of temporary event spaces and offer a replicable framework for enhancing the visual appeal of events in remote areas throughout Japan.</description>

      <title>MapColorAI: Designing Contextually Relevant Choropleth Map Color Schemes Using a Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Choropleth maps, which utilize color schemes to visualize spatial patterns and trends, are simple yet effective tools for geographic data analysis. As such, color scheme design is a critical aspect of choropleth map creation. The traditional coloring methods offered by GIS tools such as ArcGIS and QGIS are not user-friendly for non-professionals. On the one hand, these tools provide numerous color schemes, making it hard to decide which one best matches the theme. On the other hand, it is difficult to fulfill some ambiguous and personalized coloring needs of users, such as requests for 'summer-like' map colors. To address these shortcomings, we develop a novel system that leverages a large language model and map color design principles to generate contextually relevant and user-aligned choropleth map color schemes. The system follows a three-stage process: Data processing, which provides an overview of the data and classifies the data into meaningful classes; Color Concept Design, where the color theme and color mode are conceptualized based on data characteristics and user intentions; and Color Scheme Design, where specific colors are assigned to classes based on generated color theme, color mode, and user requirements. Our system incorporates an interactive interface, providing necessary visualization for choropleth map color design and allowing users to customize and refine color choices flexibly. Through user studies and evaluations, the system demonstrates acceptable usability, accuracy, and flexibility, with users highlighting the tool's efficiency and ease of use.</description>

      <title>Beyond Accuracy, SHAP, and Anchors -- On the difficulty of designing effective end-user explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning produces models that are impossible for users or developers to fully understand -- raising concerns about trust, oversight and human dignity. Transparency and explainability methods aim to provide some help in understanding models, but it remains challenging for developers to design explanations that are understandable to target users and effective for their purpose. Emerging guidelines and regulations set goals but may not provide effective actionable guidance to developers. In a controlled experiment with 124 participants, we investigate whether and how specific forms of policy guidance help developers design explanations for an ML-powered screening tool for diabetic retinopathy. Contrary to our expectations, we found that participants across the board struggled to produce quality explanations, comply with the provided policy requirements for explainability, and provide evidence of compliance. We posit that participant noncompliance is in part due to a failure to imagine and anticipate the needs of their audience, particularly non-technical stakeholders. Drawing on cognitive process theory and the sociological imagination to contextualize participants' failure, we recommend educational interventions.</description>

      <title>Superhuman AI Disclosure: Impacts on Toxicity, Fairness, and Trust Vary by Expertise and Persona Attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence demonstrates surpassing human performance across real-world tasks, disclosing superhuman capabilities poses challenges for fairness, accountability, and trust. To investigate how transparency impacts attitudes and perceptions, we introduce a grounded and validated set of synthetic personas reflecting diverse fairness concerns and technology acceptance levels. Then we evaluate responses in two contrasting domains: (1) a competitive player in StarCraft II, where strategy and high-skill gameplay often elicit toxic interactions, and (2) a cooperative personal-assistant in providing information. Across numerous interactions spanning persona profiles, we test non-disclosure versus explicit superhuman labelling under controlled game outcomes and usage contexts. Our findings reveal sharp domain-specific effects: in StarCraft II, explicitly labelling AI as superhuman, novice personas who learned of it reported lower toxicity and higher fairness-attributing defeat to advanced skill rather than hidden cheating-whereas expert personas found the disclosure statements irksome but still less deceptive than non-disclosure. Conversely, in the LLM as personal-assistant setting, disclosure of superhuman capabilities improved perceived trustworthiness, though it risked AI overreliance among certain persona segments. We release Dataset X-containing persona cards-including profile attributes, disclosure prompts, and detailed interaction logs, accompanied by reproducible protocols and disclaimers for adapting them to diverse tasks. Our results demonstrate that transparency is not a cure-all: while it reduces suspicion and enhances trust in cooperative contexts, it may inflame resistance or disappointment in competitive domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer-Using Agents (CUA) enable users to automate increasingly-complex tasks using graphical interfaces such as browsers. As many potential tasks require personal data, we propose Computer-Using Personal Agents (CUPAs) that have access to an external repository of the user's personal data. Compared with CUAs, CUPAs offer users better control of their personal data, the potential to automate more tasks involving personal data, better interoperability with external sources of data, and better capabilities to coordinate with other CUPAs in order to solve collaborative tasks involving the personal data of multiple users.</description>

      <title>In Pursuit of Predictive Models of Human Preferences Toward AI Teammates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We seek measurable properties of AI agents that make them better or worse teammates from the subjective perspective of human collaborators. Our experiments use the cooperative card game Hanabi -- a common benchmark for AI-teaming research. We first evaluate AI agents on a set of objective metrics based on task performance, information theory, and game theory, which are measurable without human interaction. Next, we evaluate subjective human preferences toward AI teammates in a large-scale (N=241) human-AI teaming experiment. Finally, we correlate the AI-only objective metrics with the human subjective preferences. Our results refute common assumptions from prior literature on reinforcement learning, revealing new correlations between AI behaviors and human preferences. We find that the final game score a human-AI team achieves is less predictive of human preferences than esoteric measures of AI action diversity, strategic dominance, and ability to team with other AI. In the future, these correlations may help shape reward functions for training human-collaborative AI.</description>

      <title>From Divergence to Consensus: Evaluating the Role of Large Language Models in Facilitating Agreement through Adaptive Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving consensus in group decision-making often involves overcoming significant challenges, particularly in reconciling diverse perspectives and mitigating biases that hinder agreement. Traditional methods relying on human facilitators are often constrained by scalability and efficiency, especially in large-scale, fast-paced discussions. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel framework employing large language models (LLMs) as automated facilitators within a custom-built multi-user chat system. Leveraging cosine similarity as a core metric, this approach evaluates the ability of three state-of-the-art LLMs- ChatGPT 4.0, Mistral Large 2, and AI21 Jamba Instruct- to synthesize consensus proposals that align with participants' viewpoints. Unlike conventional techniques, the system integrates adaptive facilitation strategies, including clarifying misunderstandings, summarizing discussions, and proposing compromises, enabling the LLMs to iteratively refine consensus proposals based on user feedback. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of ChatGPT 4.0, which achieves higher alignment with participant opinions, requiring fewer iterations to reach consensus compared to its counterparts. Moreover, analysis reveals the nuanced performance of the models across various sustainability-focused discussion topics, such as climate action, quality education, good health and well-being, and access to clean water and sanitation. These findings highlight the transformative potential of LLM-driven facilitation for improving collective decision-making processes and underscore the importance of advancing evaluation metrics and cross-cultural adaptability in future research.</description>

      <title>KHAIT: K-9 Handler Artificial Intelligence Teaming for Collaborative Sensemaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In urban search and rescue (USAR) operations, communication between handlers and specially trained canines is crucial but often complicated by challenging environments and the specific behaviors canines are trained to exhibit when detecting a person. Since a USAR canine often works out of sight of the handler, the handler lacks awareness of the canine's location and situation, known as the 'sensemaking gap.' In this paper, we propose KHAIT, a novel approach to close the sensemaking gap and enhance USAR effectiveness by integrating object detection-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR). Equipped with AI-powered cameras, edge computing, and AR headsets, KHAIT enables precise and rapid object detection from a canine's perspective, improving survivor localization. We evaluate this approach in a real-world USAR environment, demonstrating an average survival allocation time decrease of 22%, enhancing the speed and accuracy of operations.</description>

      <title>The Use of Artificial Intelligence Tools in Assessing Content Validity: A Comparative Study with Human Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, it was investigated whether AI evaluators assess the content validity of B1-level English reading comprehension test items in a manner similar to human evaluators. A 25-item multiple-choice test was developed, and these test items were evaluated by four human and four AI evaluators. No statistically significant difference was found between the scores given by human and AI evaluators, with similar evaluation trends observed. The Content Validity Ratio (CVR) and the Item Content Validity Index (I-CVI) were calculated and analyzed using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test, with no statistically significant difference. The findings revealed that in some cases, AI evaluators could replace human evaluators. However, differences in specific items were thought to arise from varying interpretations of the evaluation criteria. Ensuring linguistic clarity and clearly defining criteria could contribute to more consistent evaluations. In this regard, the development of hybrid evaluation systems, in which AI technologies are used alongside human experts, is recommended.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More and more people are experiencing pressure from work, life, and education. These pressures often lead to an anxious state of mind, or even the early symptoms of suicidal ideation. With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, large language models have become one of the most prominent technologies. They are often used for detecting psychological disorders. However, current studies primarily provide categorization results without offering interpretable explanations for these results. To address this gap, this study adopts a person-centered perspective and focuses on GPT-generated multi-scenario simulated conversations. These simulated conversations were selected as data samples for the study. Various transformer-based encoder models were utilized to develop a classification model capable of identifying different levels of anxiety. Additionally, a knowledge base focusing on anxiety was constructed using LangChain and GPT-4. When analyzing classification results, this knowledge base was able to provide explanations and reasons most relevant to the interlocutor's anxiety situation. The study demonstrates that the proposed model achieves over 94% accuracy in categorical prediction, and the advice provided is highly personalized and relevant.</description>

      <title>Complying with the EU AI Act: Innovations in Explainable and User-Centric Hand Gesture Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The EU AI Act underscores the importance of transparency, user-centricity, and robustness in AI systems, particularly for high-risk systems. In response, we present advancements in XentricAI, an explainable hand gesture recognition (HGR) system designed to meet these regulatory requirements. XentricAI adresses fundamental challenges in HGR, such as the opacity of black-box models using explainable AI methods and the handling of distributional shifts in real-world data through transfer learning techniques. We extend an existing radar-based HGR dataset by adding 28,000 new gestures, with contributions from multiple users across varied locations, including 24,000 out-of-distribution gestures. Leveraging this real-world dataset, we enhance XentricAI's capabilities by integrating a variational autoencoder module for improved gesture anomaly detection, incorporating user-specific thresholding. This integration enables the identification of 11.50% more anomalous gestures. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a 97.5% sucess rate in characterizing these anomalies, significantly improving system explainability. Furthermore, the implementation of transfer learning techniques has shown a substantial increase in user adaptability, with an average improvement of at least 15.17%. This work contributes to the development of trustworthy AI systems by providing both technical advancements and regulatory compliance, offering a commercially viable solution that aligns with the EU AI Act requirements.</description>

Abstract: Amidst the race to create more intelligent machines, this paper asserts a critical need to invest in human reasoning so that people can manage the many new challenges and opportunities of the future. As people face accelerating changes and complexities in our society, there is a risk that we will rely on AI in ways that reduce our own agency as humans. This paper outlines a human-centered augmented reasoning paradigm by 1. Articulating fundamental principles for augmented reasoning tools, emphasizing their ergonomic, pre-conclusive, directable, exploratory, enhancing, and integrated nature; 2. Proposing a 'many tasks, many tools' approach to ensuring human control, and 3. Offering examples of interaction modes that can serve as bridges between human reasoning and AI algorithms.</description>

      <title>There must be encapsulated nonconceptual content in vision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper I want to propose an argument to support Jerry Fodor's thesis (Fodor 1983) that input systems are modular and thus informationally encapsulated. The argument starts with the suggestion that there is a "grounding problem" in perception, i. e. that there is a problem in explaining how perception that can yield a visual experience is possible, how sensation can become meaningful perception of something for the subject. Given that visual experience is actually possible, this invites a transcendental argument that explains the conditions of its possibility. I propose that one of these conditions is the existence of a visual module in Fodor's sense that allows the step from sensation to object-identifying perception, thus enabling visual experience. It seems to follow that there is informationally encapsulated nonconceptual content in visual perception.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying reputable Ethereum projects remains a critical challenge within the expanding blockchain ecosystem. The ability to distinguish between legitimate initiatives and potentially fraudulent schemes is non-trivial. This work presents a systematic approach that integrates multiple data sources with advanced analytics to evaluate credibility, transparency, and overall trustworthiness. The methodology applies machine learning techniques to analyse transaction histories on the Ethereum blockchain.
  The study classifies accounts based on a dataset comprising 2,179 entities linked to illicit activities and 3,977 associated with reputable projects. Using the LightGBM algorithm, the approach achieves an average accuracy of 0.984 and an average AUC of 0.999, validated through 10-fold cross-validation. Key influential factors include time differences between transactions and received_tnx.
  The proposed methodology provides a robust mechanism for identifying reputable Ethereum projects, fostering a more secure and transparent investment environment. By equipping stakeholders with data-driven insights, this research enables more informed decision-making, risk mitigation, and the promotion of legitimate blockchain initiatives. Furthermore, it lays the foundation for future advancements in trust assessment methodologies, contributing to the continued development and maturity of the Ethereum ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Enforcing Cybersecurity Constraints for LLM-driven Robot Agents for Online Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous robotic agents for conducting online transactions poses significant cybersecurity challenges. This study aims to enforce robust cybersecurity constraints to mitigate the risks associated with data breaches, transaction fraud, and system manipulation. The background focuses on the rise of LLM-driven robotic systems in e-commerce, finance, and service industries, alongside the vulnerabilities they introduce. A novel security architecture combining blockchain technology with multi-factor authentication (MFA) and real-time anomaly detection was implemented to safeguard transactions. Key performance metrics such as transaction integrity, response time, and breach detection accuracy were evaluated, showing improved security and system performance. The results highlight that the proposed architecture reduced fraudulent transactions by 90%, improved breach detection accuracy to 98%, and ensured secure transaction validation within a latency of 0.05 seconds. These findings emphasize the importance of cybersecurity in the deployment of LLM-driven robotic systems and suggest a framework adaptable to various online platforms.</description>

      <title>Prompt Flow Integrity to Prevent Privilege Escalation in LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are combined with plugins to create powerful LLM agents that provide a wide range of services. Unlike traditional software, LLM agent's behavior is determined at runtime by natural language prompts from either user or plugin's data. This flexibility enables a new computing paradigm with unlimited capabilities and programmability, but also introduces new security risks, vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks. Moreover, user prompt is prone to be interpreted in an insecure way by LLM agents, creating non-deterministic behaviors that can be exploited by attackers. To address these security risks, we propose Prompt Flow Integrity (PFI), a system security-oriented solution to prevent privilege escalation in LLM agents. Analyzing the architectural characteristics of LLM agents, PFI features three mitigation techniques -- i.e., untrusted data identification, enforcing least privilege on LLM agents, and validating unsafe data flows. Our evaluation result shows that PFI effectively mitigates privilege escalation attacks while successfully preserving the utility of LLM agents.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Aware RAG: Secure and Isolated Knowledge Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in real-world applications has heightened concerns about the confidentiality and integrity of their proprietary knowledge bases. These knowledge bases, which play a critical role in enhancing the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly vulnerable to breaches that could compromise sensitive information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an advanced encryption methodology designed to protect RAG systems from unauthorized access and data leakage. Our approach encrypts both textual content and its corresponding embeddings prior to storage, ensuring that all data remains securely encrypted. This mechanism restricts access to authorized entities with the appropriate decryption keys, thereby significantly reducing the risk of unintended data exposure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our encryption strategy preserves the performance and functionality of RAG pipelines, ensuring compatibility across diverse domains and applications. To validate the robustness of our method, we provide comprehensive security proofs that highlight its resilience against potential threats and vulnerabilities. These proofs also reveal limitations in existing approaches, which often lack robustness, adaptability, or reliance on open-source models. Our findings suggest that integrating advanced encryption techniques into the design and deployment of RAG systems can effectively enhance privacy safeguards. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on improving security measures for AI-driven services and advocates for stricter data protection standards within RAG architectures.</description>

      <title>Rendering Transparency to Ranking in Educational Assessment via Bayesian Comparative Judgement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring transparency in educational assessment is increasingly critical, particularly post-pandemic, as demand grows for fairer and more reliable evaluation methods. Comparative Judgement (CJ) offers a promising alternative to traditional assessments, yet concerns remain about its perceived opacity. This paper examines how Bayesian Comparative Judgement (BCJ) enhances transparency by integrating prior information into the judgement process, providing a structured, data-driven approach that improves interpretability and accountability.
  BCJ assigns probabilities to judgement outcomes, offering quantifiable measures of uncertainty and deeper insights into decision confidence. By systematically tracking how prior data and successive judgements inform final rankings, BCJ clarifies the assessment process and helps identify assessor disagreements. Multi-criteria BCJ extends this by evaluating multiple learning outcomes (LOs) independently, preserving the richness of CJ while producing transparent, granular rankings aligned with specific assessment goals. It also enables a holistic ranking derived from individual LOs, ensuring comprehensive evaluations without compromising detailed feedback.
  Using a real higher education dataset with professional markers in the UK, we demonstrate BCJ's quantitative rigour and ability to clarify ranking rationales. Through qualitative analysis and discussions with experienced CJ practitioners, we explore its effectiveness in contexts where transparency is crucial, such as high-stakes national assessments. We highlight the benefits and limitations of BCJ, offering insights into its real-world application across various educational settings.</description>

      <title>Zero-Knowledge Federated Learning: A New Trustworthy and Privacy-Preserving Distributed Learning Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in distributed machine learning, enabling collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, despite its many advantages, FL still contends with significant challenges -- most notably regarding security and trust. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) offer a potential solution by establishing trust and enhancing system integrity throughout the FL process. Although several studies have explored ZKP-based FL (ZK-FL), a systematic framework and comprehensive analysis are still lacking. This article makes two key contributions. First, we propose a structured ZK-FL framework that categorizes and analyzes the technical roles of ZKPs across various FL stages and tasks. Second, we introduce a novel algorithm, Verifiable Client Selection FL (Veri-CS-FL), which employs ZKPs to refine the client selection process. In Veri-CS-FL, participating clients generate verifiable proofs for the performance metrics of their local models and submit these concise proofs to the server for efficient verification. The server then selects clients with high-quality local models for uploading, subsequently aggregating the contributions from these selected clients. By integrating ZKPs, Veri-CS-FL not only ensures the accuracy of performance metrics but also fortifies trust among participants while enhancing the overall efficiency and security of FL systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient but Vulnerable: Benchmarking and Defending LLM Batch Prompting Attack</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Batch prompting, which combines a batch of multiple queries sharing the same context in one inference, has emerged as a promising solution to reduce inference costs. However, our study reveals a significant security vulnerability in batch prompting: malicious users can inject attack instructions into a batch, leading to unwanted interference across all queries, which can result in the inclusion of harmful content, such as phishing links, or the disruption of logical reasoning. In this paper, we construct BATCHSAFEBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 150 attack instructions of two types and 8k batch instances, to study the batch prompting vulnerability systematically. Our evaluation of both closed-source and open-weight LLMs demonstrates that all LLMs are susceptible to batch-prompting attacks. We then explore multiple defending approaches. While the prompting-based defense shows limited effectiveness for smaller LLMs, the probing-based approach achieves about 95% accuracy in detecting attacks. Additionally, we perform a mechanistic analysis to understand the attack and identify attention heads that are responsible for it.</description>

      <title>Whole-Body Image-to-Image Translation for a Virtual Scanner in a Healthcare Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating positron emission tomography (PET) images from computed tomography (CT) scans via deep learning offers a promising pathway to reduce radiation exposure and costs associated with PET imaging, improving patient care and accessibility to functional imaging. Whole-body image translation presents challenges due to anatomical heterogeneity, often limiting generalized models. We propose a framework that segments whole-body CT images into four regions-head, trunk, arms, and legs-and uses district-specific Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for tailored CT-to-PET translation. Synthetic PET images from each region are stitched together to reconstruct the whole-body scan. Comparisons with a baseline non-segmented GAN and experiments with Pix2Pix and CycleGAN architectures tested paired and unpaired scenarios. Quantitative evaluations at district, whole-body, and lesion levels demonstrated significant improvements with our district-specific GANs. Pix2Pix yielded superior metrics, ensuring precise, high-quality image synthesis. By addressing anatomical heterogeneity, this approach achieves state-of-the-art results in whole-body CT-to-PET translation. This methodology supports healthcare Digital Twins by enabling accurate virtual PET scans from CT data, creating virtual imaging representations to monitor, predict, and optimize health outcomes.</description>

      <title>A Bird Song Detector for improving bird identification through Deep Learning: a case study from Do\~nana</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passive Acoustic Monitoring with automatic recorders is essential for ecosystem conservation but generates vast unsupervised audio data, posing challenges for extracting meaningful information. Deep Learning techniques offer a promising solution. BirdNET, a widely used model for bird identification, has shown success in many study systems but is limited in some regions due to biases in its training data. A key challenge in bird species detection is that many recordings either lack target species or contain overlapping vocalizations. To overcome these problems, we developed a multi-stage pipeline for automatic bird vocalization identification in Do\~nana National Park (SW Spain), a region facing significant conservation threats. Our approach included a Bird Song Detector to isolate vocalizations and custom classifiers trained with BirdNET embeddings. We manually annotated 461 minutes of audio from three habitats across nine locations, yielding 3,749 annotations for 34 classes. Spectrograms facilitated the use of image processing techniques. Applying the Bird Song Detector before classification improved species identification, as all classification models performed better when analyzing only the segments where birds were detected. Specifically, the combination of the Bird Song Detector and fine-tuned BirdNET compared to the baseline without the Bird Song Detector. Our approach demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating a Bird Song Detector with fine-tuned classification models for bird identification at local soundscapes. These findings highlight the need to adapt general-purpose tools for specific ecological challenges, as demonstrated in Do\~nana. Automatically detecting bird species serves for tracking the health status of this threatened ecosystem, given the sensitivity of birds to environmental changes, and helps in the design of conservation measures for reducing biodiversity loss</description>

      <title>PEnGUiN: Partially Equivariant Graph NeUral Networks for Sample Efficient MARL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have emerged as a promising approach in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), leveraging symmetry guarantees to greatly improve sample efficiency and generalization. However, real-world environments often exhibit inherent asymmetries arising from factors such as external forces, measurement inaccuracies, or intrinsic system biases. This paper introduces \textit{Partially Equivariant Graph NeUral Networks (PEnGUiN)}, a novel architecture specifically designed to address these challenges. We formally identify and categorize various types of partial equivariance relevant to MARL, including subgroup equivariance, feature-wise equivariance, regional equivariance, and approximate equivariance. We theoretically demonstrate that PEnGUiN is capable of learning both fully equivariant (EGNN) and non-equivariant (GNN) representations within a unified framework. Through extensive experiments on a range of MARL problems incorporating various asymmetries, we empirically validate the efficacy of PEnGUiN. Our results consistently demonstrate that PEnGUiN outperforms both EGNNs and standard GNNs in asymmetric environments, highlighting their potential to improve the robustness and applicability of graph-based MARL algorithms in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>CAM-Seg: A Continuous-valued Embedding Approach for Semantic Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional transformer-based semantic segmentation relies on quantized embeddings. However, our analysis reveals that autoencoder accuracy on segmentation mask using quantized embeddings (e.g. VQ-VAE) is 8% lower than continuous-valued embeddings (e.g. KL-VAE). Motivated by this, we propose a continuous-valued embedding framework for semantic segmentation. By reformulating semantic mask generation as a continuous image-to-embedding diffusion process, our approach eliminates the need for discrete latent representations while preserving fine-grained spatial and semantic details. Our key contribution includes a diffusion-guided autoregressive transformer that learns a continuous semantic embedding space by modeling long-range dependencies in image features. Our framework contains a unified architecture combining a VAE encoder for continuous feature extraction, a diffusion-guided transformer for conditioned embedding generation, and a VAE decoder for semantic mask reconstruction. Our setting facilitates zero-shot domain adaptation capabilities enabled by the continuity of the embedding space. Experiments across diverse datasets (e.g., Cityscapes and domain-shifted variants) demonstrate state-of-the-art robustness to distribution shifts, including adverse weather (e.g., fog, snow) and viewpoint variations. Our model also exhibits strong noise resilience, achieving robust performance ($\approx$ 95% AP compared to baseline) under gaussian noise, moderate motion blur, and moderate brightness/contrast variations, while experiencing only a moderate impact ($\approx$ 90% AP compared to baseline) from 50% salt and pepper noise, saturation and hue shifts.

      <title>Does Context Matter? ContextualJudgeBench for Evaluating LLM-based Judges in Contextual Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large language model (LLM)-as-judge paradigm has been used to meet the demand for a cheap, reliable, and fast evaluation of model outputs during AI system development and post-deployment monitoring. While judge models -- LLMs finetuned to specialize in assessing and critiquing model outputs -- have been touted as general purpose evaluators, they are typically evaluated only on non-contextual scenarios, such as instruction following. The omission of contextual settings -- those where external information is used as context to generate an output -- is surprising given the increasing prevalence of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and summarization use cases. Contextual assessment is uniquely challenging, as evaluation often depends on practitioner priorities, leading to conditional evaluation criteria (e.g., comparing responses based on factuality and then considering completeness if they are equally factual). To address the gap, we propose ContextualJudgeBench, a judge benchmark with 2,000 challenging response pairs across eight splits inspired by real-world contextual evaluation scenarios. We build our benchmark with a multi-pronged data construction pipeline that leverages both existing human annotations and model-based perturbations. Our comprehensive study across 11 judge models and 9 general purpose models, reveals that the contextual information and its assessment criteria present a significant challenge to even state-of-the-art models. For example, OpenAI's o1, the best-performing model, barely reaches 55% consistent accuracy.</description>

      <title>LLaVA-MORE: A Comparative Study of LLMs and Visual Backbones for Enhanced Visual Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has highlighted the critical roles of both the visual backbone and the underlying language model. While prior work has primarily focused on scaling these components to billions of parameters, the trade-offs between model size, architecture, and performance remain underexplored. Additionally, inconsistencies in training data and evaluation protocols have hindered direct comparisons, making it difficult to derive optimal design choices. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-MORE, a new family of MLLMs that integrates recent language models with diverse visual backbones. To ensure fair comparisons, we employ a unified training protocol applied consistently across all architectures. Our analysis systematically explores both small- and medium-scale LLMs -- including Phi-4, LLaMA-3.1, and Gemma-2 -- to evaluate multimodal reasoning, generation, and instruction following, while examining the relationship between model size and performance. Beyond evaluating the LLM impact on final results, we conduct a comprehensive study of various visual encoders, ranging from CLIP-based architectures to alternatives such as DINOv2, SigLIP, and SigLIP2. Additional experiments investigate the effects of increased image resolution and variations in pre-training datasets. Overall, our results provide insights into the design of more effective MLLMs, offering a reproducible evaluation framework that facilitates direct comparisons and can guide future model development. Our source code and trained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/aimagelab/LLaVA-MORE.</description>

      <title>Neural Lyapunov Function Approximation with Self-Supervised Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control Lyapunov functions are traditionally used to design a controller which ensures convergence to a desired state, yet deriving these functions for nonlinear systems remains a complex challenge. This paper presents a novel, sample-efficient method for neural approximation of nonlinear Lyapunov functions, leveraging self-supervised Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance training data generation, particularly for inaccurately represented regions of the state space. The proposed approach employs a data-driven World Model to train Lyapunov functions from off-policy trajectories. The method is validated on both standard and goal-conditioned robotic tasks, demonstrating faster convergence and higher approximation accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art neural Lyapunov approximation baseline.

      <title>A Context-Driven Training-Free Network for Lightweight Scene Text Segmentation and Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern scene text recognition systems often depend on large end-to-end architectures that require extensive training and are prohibitively expensive for real-time scenarios. In such cases, the deployment of heavy models becomes impractical due to constraints on memory, computational resources, and latency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel, training-free plug-and-play framework that leverages the strengths of pre-trained text recognizers while minimizing redundant computations. Our approach uses context-based understanding and introduces an attention-based segmentation stage, which refines candidate text regions at the pixel level, improving downstream recognition. Instead of performing traditional text detection that follows a block-level comparison between feature map and source image and harnesses contextual information using pretrained captioners, allowing the framework to generate word predictions directly from scene context.Candidate texts are semantically and lexically evaluated to get a final score. Predictions that meet or exceed a pre-defined confidence threshold bypass the heavier process of end-to-end text STR profiling, ensuring faster inference and cutting down on unnecessary computations. Experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that our paradigm achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art systems, yet requires substantially fewer resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) have emerged as the leading approach for machine learning on graphs, attracting significant attention in recent years. While a large set of works explored the expressivity of MPNNs, i.e., their ability to separate graphs and approximate functions over them, comparatively less attention has been directed toward investigating their generalization abilities, i.e., making meaningful predictions beyond the training data. Here, we systematically review the existing literature on the generalization abilities of MPNNs. We analyze the strengths and limitations of various studies in these domains, providing insights into their methodologies and findings. Furthermore, we identify potential avenues for future research, aiming to deepen our understanding of the generalization abilities of MPNNs.</description>

      <title>UI-Vision: A Desktop-centric GUI Benchmark for Visual Perception and Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents that navigate Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to automate tasks like document editing and file management can greatly enhance computer workflows. While existing research focuses on online settings, desktop environments, critical for many professional and everyday tasks, remain underexplored due to data collection challenges and licensing issues. We introduce UI-Vision, the first comprehensive, license-permissive benchmark for offline, fine-grained evaluation of computer use agents in real-world desktop environments. Unlike online benchmarks, UI-Vision provides: (i) dense, high-quality annotations of human demonstrations, including bounding boxes, UI labels, and action trajectories (clicks, drags, and keyboard inputs) across 83 software applications, and (ii) three fine-to-coarse grained tasks-Element Grounding, Layout Grounding, and Action Prediction-with well-defined metrics to rigorously evaluate agents' performance in desktop environments. Our evaluation reveals critical limitations in state-of-the-art models like UI-TARS-72B, including issues with understanding professional software, spatial reasoning, and complex actions like drag-and-drop. These findings highlight the challenges in developing fully autonomous computer use agents. By releasing UI-Vision as open-source, we aim to advance the development of more capable agents for real-world desktop tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do two deep neural networks differ in how they arrive at a decision? Measuring the similarity of deep networks has been a long-standing open question. Most existing methods provide a single number to measure the similarity of two networks at a given layer, but give no insight into what makes them similar or dissimilar. We introduce an interpretable representational similarity method (RSVC) to compare two networks. We use RSVC to discover shared and unique visual concepts between two models. We show that some aspects of model differences can be attributed to unique concepts discovered by one model that are not well represented in the other. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluation across different vision model architectures and training protocols to demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Predicting Multi-Agent Specialization via Task Parallelizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems often rely on specialized agents with distinct roles rather than general-purpose agents that perform the entire task independently. However, the conditions that govern the optimal degree of specialization remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose that specialist teams outperform generalist ones when environmental constraints limit task parallelizability -- the potential to execute task components concurrently. Drawing inspiration from distributed systems, we introduce a heuristic to predict the relative efficiency of generalist versus specialist teams by estimating the speed-up achieved when two agents perform a task in parallel rather than focus on complementary subtasks. We validate this heuristic through three multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) experiments in Overcooked-AI, demonstrating that key factors limiting task parallelizability influence specialization. We also observe that as the state space expands, agents tend to converge on specialist strategies, even when generalist ones are theoretically more efficient, highlighting potential biases in MARL training algorithms. Our findings provide a principled framework for interpreting specialization given the task and environment, and introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating whether MARL finds optimal strategies.</description>

      <title>Safety Aware Task Planning via Large Language Models in Robotics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotic task planning has unlocked better reasoning capabilities for complex, long-horizon workflows. However, ensuring safety in LLM-driven plans remains a critical challenge, as these models often prioritize task completion over risk mitigation. This paper introduces SAFER (Safety-Aware Framework for Execution in Robotics), a multi-LLM framework designed to embed safety awareness into robotic task planning. SAFER employs a Safety Agent that operates alongside the primary task planner, providing safety feedback. Additionally, we introduce LLM-as-a-Judge, a novel metric leveraging LLMs as evaluators to quantify safety violations within generated task plans. Our framework integrates safety feedback at multiple stages of execution, enabling real-time risk assessment, proactive error correction, and transparent safety evaluation. We also integrate a control framework using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to ensure safety guarantees within SAFER's task planning. We evaluated SAFER against state-of-the-art LLM planners on complex long-horizon tasks involving heterogeneous robotic agents, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing safety violations while maintaining task efficiency. We also verify the task planner and safety planner through actual hardware experiments involving multiple robots and a human.</description>

      <title>Reward Training Wheels: Adaptive Auxiliary Rewards for Robotics Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotics Reinforcement Learning (RL) often relies on carefully engineered auxiliary rewards to supplement sparse primary learning objectives to compensate for the lack of large-scale, real-world, trial-and-error data. While these auxiliary rewards accelerate learning, they require significant engineering effort, may introduce human biases, and cannot adapt to the robot's evolving capabilities during training. In this paper, we introduce Reward Training Wheels (RTW), a teacher-student framework that automates auxiliary reward adaptation for robotics RL. To be specific, the RTW teacher dynamically adjusts auxiliary reward weights based on the student's evolving capabilities to determine which auxiliary reward aspects require more or less emphasis to improve the primary objective. We demonstrate RTW on two challenging robot tasks: navigation in highly constrained spaces and off-road vehicle mobility on vertically challenging terrain. In simulation, RTW outperforms expert-designed rewards by 2.35% in navigation success rate and improves off-road mobility performance by 122.62%, while achieving 35% and 3X faster training efficiency, respectively. Physical robot experiments further validate RTW's effectiveness, achieving a perfect success rate (5/5 trials vs. 2/5 for expert-designed rewards) and improving vehicle stability with up to 47.4% reduction in orientation angles.</description>

      <title>AutoRedTeamer: Autonomous Red Teaming with Lifelong Attack Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable, security and safety evaluation are crucial. While current red teaming approaches have made strides in assessing LLM vulnerabilities, they often rely heavily on human input and lack comprehensive coverage of emerging attack vectors. This paper introduces AutoRedTeamer, a novel framework for fully automated, end-to-end red teaming against LLMs. AutoRedTeamer combines a multi-agent architecture with a memory-guided attack selection mechanism to enable continuous discovery and integration of new attack vectors. The dual-agent framework consists of a red teaming agent that can operate from high-level risk categories alone to generate and execute test cases and a strategy proposer agent that autonomously discovers and implements new attacks by analyzing recent research. This modular design allows AutoRedTeamer to adapt to emerging threats while maintaining strong performance on existing attack vectors. We demonstrate AutoRedTeamer's effectiveness across diverse evaluation settings, achieving 20% higher attack success rates on HarmBench against Llama-3.1-70B while reducing computational costs by 46% compared to existing approaches. AutoRedTeamer also matches the diversity of human-curated benchmarks in generating test cases, providing a comprehensive, scalable, and continuously evolving framework for evaluating the security of AI systems.</description>

      <title>ATTENTION2D: Communication Efficient Distributed Self-Attention Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have emerged as a leading architecture for natural language processing, natural language generation, and image generation tasks. A fundamental element of the transformer architecture is self-attention, which allows the model to capture intricate dependencies within the data. However, the self-attention mechanism also incurs significant computational and memory costs, particularly for long sequences.
  In this paper, we introduce ATTENTION2D, a novel approach that exploits parallelism along two dimensions - query and key/value - of the self-attention operation. This method enables efficient distribution and parallelization of computations across multiple devices. Our approach facilitates asymptotically faster training and inference phases compared to previous methods, without relying on approximations or incurring additional computational or memory overheads. Furthermore, unlike existing techniques that struggle to scale with an increasing number of processing units, our approach effectively scales with additional processing units.
  Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method in improving communication efficiency and scalability. Compared to Ring Attention, our approach demonstrated up to a 5x performance boost on a GPT-3-like model using 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs across 16 nodes, and up to a 9.4x performance boost on 64 NVIDIA H100 GPUs across 64 nodes.</description>

      <title>Towards Agentic AI Networking in 6G: A Generative Foundation Model-as-Agent Approach</title>

Abstract: The promising potential of AI and network convergence in improving networking performance and enabling new service capabilities has recently attracted significant interest. Existing network AI solutions, while powerful, are mainly built based on the close-loop and passive learning framework, resulting in major limitations in autonomous solution finding and dynamic environmental adaptation. Agentic AI has recently been introduced as a promising solution to address the above limitations and pave the way for true generally intelligent and beneficial AI systems. The key idea is to create a networking ecosystem to support a diverse range of autonomous and embodied AI agents in fulfilling their goals. In this paper, we focus on the novel challenges and requirements of agentic AI networking. We propose AgentNet, a novel framework for supporting interaction, collaborative learning, and knowledge transfer among AI agents. We introduce a general architectural framework of AgentNet and then propose a generative foundation model (GFM)-based implementation in which multiple GFM-as-agents have been created as an interactive knowledge-base to bootstrap the development of embodied AI agents according to different task requirements and environmental features. We consider two application scenarios, digital-twin-based industrial automation and metaverse-based infotainment system, to describe how to apply AgentNet for supporting efficient task-driven collaboration and interaction among AI agents.</description>

      <title>Can one size fit all?: Measuring Failure in Multi-Document Summarization Domain Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstractive multi-document summarization (MDS) is the task of automatically summarizing information in multiple documents, from news articles to conversations with multiple speakers. The training approaches for current MDS models can be grouped into four approaches: end-to-end with special pre-training ("direct"), chunk-then-summarize, extract-then-summarize, and inference with GPT-style models. In this work, we evaluate MDS models across training approaches, domains, and dimensions (reference similarity, quality, and factuality), to analyze how and why models trained on one domain can fail to summarize documents from another (News, Science, and Conversation) in the zero-shot domain transfer setting. We define domain-transfer "failure" as a decrease in factuality, higher deviation from the target, and a general decrease in summary quality. In addition to exploring domain transfer for MDS models, we examine potential issues with applying popular summarization metrics out-of-the-box.</description>

      <title>Detecting LLM-Written Peer Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Editors of academic journals and program chairs of conferences require peer reviewers to write their own reviews. However, there is growing concern about the rise of lazy reviewing practices, where reviewers use large language models (LLMs) to generate reviews instead of writing them independently. Existing tools for detecting LLM-generated content are not designed to differentiate between fully LLM-generated reviews and those merely polished by an LLM. In this work, we employ a straightforward approach to identify LLM-generated reviews - doing an indirect prompt injection via the paper PDF to ask the LLM to embed a watermark. Our focus is on presenting watermarking schemes and statistical tests that maintain a bounded family-wise error rate, when a venue evaluates multiple reviews, with a higher power as compared to standard methods like Bonferroni correction. These guarantees hold without relying on any assumptions about human-written reviews. We also consider various methods for prompt injection including font embedding and jailbreaking. We evaluate the effectiveness and various tradeoffs of these methods, including different reviewer defenses. We find a high success rate in the embedding of our watermarks in LLM-generated reviews across models. We also find that our approach is resilient to common reviewer defenses, and that the bounds on error rates in our statistical tests hold in practice while having the power to flag LLM-generated reviews, while Bonferroni correction is infeasible.</description>

      <title>MobiFuse: Learning Universal Human Mobility Patterns through Cross-domain Data Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human mobility modeling is critical for urban planning and transportation management, yet existing datasets often lack the resolution and semantic richness required for comprehensive analysis. To address this, we proposed a cross-domain data fusion framework that integrates multi-modal data of distinct nature and spatio-temporal resolution, including geographical, mobility, socio-demographic, and traffic information, to construct a privacy-preserving and semantically enriched human travel trajectory dataset. This framework is demonstrated through two case studies in Los Angeles (LA) and Egypt, where a domain adaptation algorithm ensures its transferability across diverse urban contexts. Quantitative evaluation shows that the generated synthetic dataset accurately reproduces mobility patterns observed in empirical data. Moreover, large-scale traffic simulations for LA County based on the generated synthetic demand align well with observed traffic. On California's I-405 corridor, the simulation yields a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 5.85% for traffic volume and 4.36% for speed compared to Caltrans PeMS observations.</description>

      <title>Grammar and Gameplay-aligned RL for Game Description Generation with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Game Description Generation (GDG) is the task of generating a game description written in a Game Description Language (GDL) from natural language text. Previous studies have explored generation methods leveraging the contextual understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs); however, accurately reproducing the game features of the game descriptions remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning of LLMs for GDG (RLGDG). Our training method simultaneously improves grammatical correctness and fidelity to game concepts by introducing both grammar rewards and concept rewards. Furthermore, we adopt a two-stage training strategy where Reinforcement Learning (RL) is applied following Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baseline methods using SFT alone.</description>

      <title>Blend the Separated: Mixture of Synergistic Experts for Data-Scarcity Drug-Target Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug-target interaction prediction (DTI) is essential in various applications including drug discovery and clinical application. There are two perspectives of input data widely used in DTI prediction: Intrinsic data represents how drugs or targets are constructed, and extrinsic data represents how drugs or targets are related to other biological entities. However, any of the two perspectives of input data can be scarce for some drugs or targets, especially for those unpopular or newly discovered. Furthermore, ground-truth labels for specific interaction types can also be scarce. Therefore, we propose the first method to tackle DTI prediction under input data and/or label scarcity. To make our model functional when only one perspective of input data is available, we design two separate experts to process intrinsic and extrinsic data respectively and fuse them adaptively according to different samples. Furthermore, to make the two perspectives complement each other and remedy label scarcity, two experts synergize with each other in a mutually supervised way to exploit the enormous unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets under different extents of input data scarcity and/or label scarcity demonstrate our model outperforms states of the art significantly and steadily, with a maximum improvement of 53.53%. We also test our model without any data scarcity and it still outperforms current methods.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT and U(X): A Rapid Review on Measuring the User Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ChatGPT, powered by a large language model (LLM), has revolutionized everyday human-computer interaction (HCI) since its 2022 release. While now used by millions around the world, a coherent pathway for evaluating the user experience (UX) ChatGPT offers remains missing. In this rapid review (N = 58), I explored how ChatGPT UX has been approached quantitatively so far. I focused on the independent variables (IVs) manipulated, the dependent variables (DVs) measured, and the methods used for measurement. Findings reveal trends, gaps, and emerging consensus in UX assessments. This work offers a first step towards synthesizing existing approaches to measuring ChatGPT UX, urgent trajectories to advance standardization and breadth, and two preliminary frameworks aimed at guiding future research and tool development. I seek to elevate the field of ChatGPT UX by empowering researchers and practitioners in optimizing user interactions with ChatGPT and similar LLM-based systems.</description>

      <title>Computation-Efficient and Recognition-Friendly 3D Point Cloud Privacy Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D point cloud has been widely used in applications such as self-driving cars, robotics, CAD models, etc. To the best of our knowledge, these applications raised the issue of privacy leakage in 3D point clouds, which has not been studied well. Different from the 2D image privacy, which is related to texture and 2D geometric structure, the 3D point cloud is texture-less and only relevant to 3D geometric structure. In this work, we defined the 3D point cloud privacy problem and proposed an efficient privacy-preserving framework named PointFlowGMM that can support downstream classification and segmentation tasks without seeing the original data. Using a flow-based generative model, the point cloud is projected into a latent Gaussian mixture distributed subspace. We further designed a novel angular similarity loss to obfuscate the original geometric structure and reduce the model size from 767MB to 120MB without a decrease in recognition performance. The projected point cloud in the latent space is orthogonally rotated randomly to further protect the original geometric structure, the class-to-class relationship is preserved after rotation, thus, the protected point cloud can support the recognition task. We evaluated our model on multiple datasets and achieved comparable recognition results on encrypted point clouds compared to the original point clouds.</description>

      <title>F\`ux\`i: A Benchmark for Evaluating Language Models on Ancient Chinese Text Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ancient Chinese text processing presents unique challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to its distinct linguistic features, complex structural constraints, and rich cultural context. While existing benchmarks have primarily focused on evaluating comprehension through multiple-choice questions, there remains a critical gap in assessing models' generative capabilities in classical Chinese. We introduce F\`ux\`i, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates both understanding and generation capabilities across 21 diverse tasks. Our benchmark distinguishes itself through three key contributions: (1) balanced coverage of both comprehension and generation tasks, including novel tasks like poetry composition and couplet completion, (2) specialized evaluation metrics designed specifically for classical Chinese text generation, combining rule-based verification with fine-tuned LLM evaluators, and (3) a systematic assessment framework that considers both linguistic accuracy and cultural authenticity. Through extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal significant performance gaps between understanding and generation tasks, with models achieving promising results in comprehension but struggling considerably in generation tasks, particularly those requiring deep cultural knowledge and adherence to classical formats. Our findings highlight the current limitations in ancient Chinese text processing and provide insights for future model development. The benchmark, evaluation toolkit, and baseline results are publicly available to facilitate research in this domain.</description>

      <title>VideoRFSplat: Direct Scene-Level Text-to-3D Gaussian Splatting Generation with Flexible Pose and Multi-View Joint Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose VideoRFSplat, a direct text-to-3D model leveraging a video generation model to generate realistic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for unbounded real-world scenes. To generate diverse camera poses and unbounded spatial extent of real-world scenes, while ensuring generalization to arbitrary text prompts, previous methods fine-tune 2D generative models to jointly model camera poses and multi-view images. However, these methods suffer from instability when extending 2D generative models to joint modeling due to the modality gap, which necessitates additional models to stabilize training and inference. In this work, we propose an architecture and a sampling strategy to jointly model multi-view images and camera poses when fine-tuning a video generation model. Our core idea is a dual-stream architecture that attaches a dedicated pose generation model alongside a pre-trained video generation model via communication blocks, generating multi-view images and camera poses through separate streams. This design reduces interference between the pose and image modalities. Additionally, we propose an asynchronous sampling strategy that denoises camera poses faster than multi-view images, allowing rapidly denoised poses to condition multi-view generation, reducing mutual ambiguity and enhancing cross-modal consistency. Trained on multiple large-scale real-world datasets (RealEstate10K, MVImgNet, DL3DV-10K, ACID), VideoRFSplat outperforms existing text-to-3D direct generation methods that heavily depend on post-hoc refinement via score distillation sampling, achieving superior results without such refinement.</description>

      <title>Active management of battery degradation in wireless sensor network using deep reinforcement learning for group battery replacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have become a promising solution for structural health monitoring (SHM), especially in hard-to-reach or remote locations. Battery-powered WSNs offer various advantages over wired systems, however limited battery life has always been one of the biggest obstacles in practical use of the WSNs, regardless of energy harvesting methods. While various methods have been studied for battery health management, existing methods exclusively aim to extend lifetime of individual batteries, lacking a system level view. A consequence of applying such methods is that batteries in a WSN tend to fail at different times, posing significant difficulty on planning and scheduling of battery replacement trip. This study investigate a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for active battery degradation management by optimizing duty cycle of WSNs at the system level. This active management strategy effectively reduces earlier failure of battery individuals which enable group replacement without sacrificing WSN performances. A simulated environment based on a real-world WSN setup was developed to train a DRL agent and learn optimal duty cycle strategies. The performance of the strategy was validated in a long-term setup with various network sizes, demonstrating its efficiency and scalability.</description>

      <title>TruthLens: Explainable DeepFake Detection for Face Manipulated and Fully Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting DeepFakes has become a crucial research area as the widespread use of AI image generators enables the effortless creation of face-manipulated and fully synthetic content, yet existing methods are often limited to binary classification (real vs. fake) and lack interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose TruthLens, a novel and highly generalizable framework for DeepFake detection that not only determines whether an image is real or fake but also provides detailed textual reasoning for its predictions. Unlike traditional methods, TruthLens effectively handles both face-manipulated DeepFakes and fully AI-generated content while addressing fine-grained queries such as "Does the eyes/nose/mouth look real or fake?"
  The architecture of TruthLens combines the global contextual understanding of multimodal large language models like PaliGemma2 with the localized feature extraction capabilities of vision-only models like DINOv2. This hybrid design leverages the complementary strengths of both models, enabling robust detection of subtle manipulations while maintaining interpretability. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that TruthLens outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy (by 2-14%) and explainability, in both in-domain and cross-data settings, generalizing effectively across traditional and emerging manipulation techniques.</description>

      <title>Parameters vs. Context: Fine-Grained Control of Knowledge Reliance in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge. However, conflicts between parametric knowledge and retrieved context pose challenges, particularly when retrieved information is unreliable or the model's internal knowledge is outdated. In such cases, LLMs struggle to determine whether to rely more on their own parameters or the conflicted context. To address this, we propose **CK-PLUG**, a plug-and-play method for controlling LLMs' reliance on parametric and contextual knowledge. We introduce a novel knowledge consistency metric, Confidence Gain, which detects knowledge conflicts by measuring entropy shifts in token probability distributions after context insertion. CK-PLUG then enables fine-grained control over knowledge preference by adjusting the probability distribution of tokens with negative confidence gain through a single tuning parameter. Experiments demonstrate CK-PLUG's ability to significantly regulate knowledge reliance in counterfactual RAG scenarios while maintaining generation fluency and knowledge accuracy. For instance, on Llama3-8B, memory recall (MR) of RAG response can be adjusted within a broad range (9.9%-71.9%), compared to the baseline of 42.1%. Moreover, CK-PLUG supports adaptive control based on the model's confidence in both internal and external knowledge, achieving consistent performance improvements across various general RAG tasks. Our code is available at: $\href{https://github.com/byronBBL/CK-PLUG}{\text{this https URL}}$.</description>

      <title>LeanTTA: A Backpropagation-Free and Stateless Approach to Quantized Test-Time Adaptation on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While there are many advantages to deploying machine learning models on edge devices, the resource constraints of mobile platforms, the dynamic nature of the environment, and differences between the distribution of training versus in-the-wild data make such deployments challenging. Current test-time adaptation methods are often memory-intensive and not designed to be quantization-compatible or deployed on low-resource devices. To address these challenges, we present LeanTTA, a novel backpropagation-free and stateless framework for quantized test-time adaptation tailored to edge devices. Our approach minimizes computational costs by dynamically updating normalization statistics without backpropagation, which frees LeanTTA from the common pitfall of relying on large batches and historical data, making our method robust to realistic deployment scenarios. Our approach is the first to enable further computational gains by combining partial adaptation with quantized module fusion. We validate our framework across sensor modalities, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art TTA methods, including a 15.7% error reduction, peak memory usage of only 11.2MB for ResNet18, and fast adaptation within an order-of-magnitude of normal inference speeds on-device. LeanTTA provides a robust solution for achieving the right trade offs between accuracy and system efficiency in edge deployments, addressing the unique challenges posed by limited data and varied operational conditions.</description>

      <title>Time After Time: Deep-Q Effect Estimation for Interventions on When and What to do</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Problems in fields such as healthcare, robotics, and finance requires reasoning about the value both of what decision or action to take and when to take it. The prevailing hope is that artificial intelligence will support such decisions by estimating the causal effect of policies such as how to treat patients or how to allocate resources over time. However, existing methods for estimating the effect of a policy struggle with \emph{irregular time}. They either discretize time, or disregard the effect of timing policies. We present a new deep-Q algorithm that estimates the effect of both when and what to do called Earliest Disagreement Q-Evaluation (EDQ). EDQ makes use of recursion for the Q-function that is compatible with flexible sequence models, such as transformers. EDQ provides accurate estimates under standard assumptions. We validate the approach through experiments on survival time and tumor growth tasks.</description>

      <title>A multi-model approach using XAI and anomaly detection to predict asteroid hazards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential for catastrophic collision makes near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) a serious concern. Planetary defense depends on accurately classifying potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs), however the complexity of the data hampers conventional techniques. This work offers a sophisticated method for accurately predicting hazards by combining machine learning, deep learning, explainable AI (XAI), and anomaly detection. Our approach extracts essential parameters like size, velocity, and trajectory from historical and real-time asteroid data. A hybrid algorithm improves prediction accuracy by combining several cutting-edge models. A forecasting module predicts future asteroid behavior, and Monte Carlo simulations evaluate the likelihood of collisions. Timely mitigation is made possible by a real-time alarm system that notifies worldwide monitoring stations. This technique enhances planetary defense efforts by combining real-time alarms with sophisticated predictive modeling.</description>

      <title>From Structured Prompts to Open Narratives: Measuring Gender Bias in LLMs Through Open-Ended Storytelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet concerns persist regarding their tendency to reflect or amplify social biases present in their training data. This study introduces a novel evaluation framework to uncover gender biases in LLMs, focusing on their occupational narratives. Unlike previous methods relying on structured scenarios or carefully crafted prompts, our approach leverages free-form storytelling to reveal biases embedded in the models. Systematic analyses show an overrepresentation of female characters across occupations in six widely used LLMs. Additionally, our findings reveal that LLM-generated occupational gender rankings align more closely with human stereotypes than actual labor statistics. These insights underscore the need for balanced mitigation strategies to ensure fairness while avoiding the reinforcement of new stereotypes.</description>

      <title>Jasmine: Harnessing Diffusion Prior for Self-supervised Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Jasmine, the first Stable Diffusion (SD)-based self-supervised framework for monocular depth estimation, which effectively harnesses SD's visual priors to enhance the sharpness and generalization of unsupervised prediction. Previous SD-based methods are all supervised since adapting diffusion models for dense prediction requires high-precision supervision. In contrast, self-supervised reprojection suffers from inherent challenges (e.g., occlusions, texture-less regions, illumination variance), and the predictions exhibit blurs and artifacts that severely compromise SD's latent priors. To resolve this, we construct a novel surrogate task of hybrid image reconstruction. Without any additional supervision, it preserves the detail priors of SD models by reconstructing the images themselves while preventing depth estimation from degradation. Furthermore, to address the inherent misalignment between SD's scale and shift invariant estimation and self-supervised scale-invariant depth estimation, we build the Scale-Shift GRU. It not only bridges this distribution gap but also isolates the fine-grained texture of SD output against the interference of reprojection loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Jasmine achieves SoTA performance on the KITTI benchmark and exhibits superior zero-shot generalization across multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Close-up Novel View Synthesis via Pseudo-labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent methods, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in novel view synthesis. However, despite their success in producing high-quality images for viewpoints similar to those seen during training, they struggle when generating detailed images from viewpoints that significantly deviate from the training set, particularly in close-up views. The primary challenge stems from the lack of specific training data for close-up views, leading to the inability of current methods to render these views accurately. To address this issue, we introduce a novel pseudo-label-based learning strategy. This approach leverages pseudo-labels derived from existing training data to provide targeted supervision across a wide range of close-up viewpoints. Recognizing the absence of benchmarks for this specific challenge, we also present a new dataset designed to assess the effectiveness of both current and future methods in this area. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>No Thing, Nothing: Highlighting Safety-Critical Classes for Robust LiDAR Semantic Segmentation in Adverse Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing domain generalization methods for LiDAR semantic segmentation under adverse weather struggle to accurately predict "things" categories compared to "stuff" categories. In typical driving scenes, "things" categories can be dynamic and associated with higher collision risks, making them crucial for safe navigation and planning. Recognizing the importance of "things" categories, we identify their performance drop as a serious bottleneck in existing approaches. We observed that adverse weather induces degradation of semantic-level features and both corruption of local features, leading to a misprediction of "things" as "stuff". To mitigate these corruptions, we suggest our method, NTN - segmeNt Things for No-accident. To address semantic-level feature corruption, we bind each point feature to its superclass, preventing the misprediction of things classes into visually dissimilar categories. Additionally, to enhance robustness against local corruption caused by adverse weather, we define each LiDAR beam as a local region and propose a regularization term that aligns the clean data with its corrupted counterpart in feature space. NTN achieves state-of-the-art performance with a +2.6 mIoU gain on the SemanticKITTI-to-SemanticSTF benchmark and +7.9 mIoU on the SemanticPOSS-to-SemanticSTF benchmark. Notably, NTN achieves a +4.8 and +7.9 mIoU improvement on "things" classes, respectively, highlighting its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Denoising-based Contractive Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in imitation learning is the \emph{covariate shift} problem. Existing methods to mitigate covariate shift often require additional expert interactions, access to environment dynamics, or complex adversarial training, which may not be practical in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method (DeCIL) to mitigate covariate shift by incorporating a denoising mechanism that enhances the contraction properties of the state transition mapping. Our approach involves training two neural networks: a dynamics model ( f ) that predicts the next state from the current state, and a joint state-action denoising policy network ( d ) that refines this state prediction via denoising and outputs the corresponding action. We provide theoretical analysis showing that the denoising network acts as a local contraction mapping, reducing the error propagation of the state transition and improving stability. Our method is straightforward to implement and can be easily integrated with existing imitation learning frameworks without requiring additional expert data or complex modifications to the training procedure. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach effectively improves success rate of various imitation learning tasks under noise perturbation.</description>

      <title>Towards Automatic Continual Learning: A Self-Adaptive Framework for Continual Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual instruction tuning enables large language models (LLMs) to learn incrementally while retaining past knowledge, whereas existing methods primarily focus on how to retain old knowledge rather than on selecting which new knowledge to learn. In domain-specific contexts, maintaining data quality and managing system constraints remain key challenges. To address these issues, we propose an automated continual instruction tuning framework that dynamically filters incoming data, which identify and reduce redundant data across successive updates. Our approach utilizes a small proxy model for efficient perplexity-based filtering, and updates the proxy to ensure that the filtering criteria remain aligned with the evolving state of the deployed model. Compared to existing static data selection methods, our framework can effectively handle incrementally acquired data and shifting distributions. Additionally, it addresses practical deployment challenges by enabling seamless model updates, supporting version rollback and incorporating automatic checkpoint evaluation. We evaluated the system in real-world medical scenarios. It reduced computational costs by 66.7% and improved model performance, and achieved autonomous updates, thus demonstrating its effectiveness for automatic continual instruction tuning.</description>

      <title>Don't Fight Hallucinations, Use Them: Estimating Image Realism using NLI over Atomic Facts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the realism of images remains a challenging problem in the field of artificial intelligence. For example, an image of Albert Einstein holding a smartphone violates common-sense because modern smartphone were invented after Einstein's death. We introduce a novel method for assessing image realism using Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and Natural Language Inference (NLI). Our approach is based on the premise that LVLMs may generate hallucinations when confronted with images that defy common sense. Using LVLM to extract atomic facts from these images, we obtain a mix of accurate facts and erroneous hallucinations. We proceed by calculating pairwise entailment scores among these facts, subsequently aggregating these values to yield a singular reality score. This process serves to identify contradictions between genuine facts and hallucinatory elements, signaling the presence of images that violate common sense. Our approach has achieved a new state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot mode on the WHOOPS! dataset.</description>

      <title>GAN-enhanced Simulation-driven DNN Testing in Absence of Ground Truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of synthetic inputs via simulators driven by search algorithms is essential for cost-effective testing of Deep Neural Network (DNN) components for safety-critical systems. However, in many applications, simulators are unable to produce the ground-truth data needed for automated test oracles and to guide the search process.
  To tackle this issue, we propose an approach for the generation of inputs for computer vision DNNs that integrates a generative network to ensure simulator fidelity and employs heuristic-based search fitnesses that leverage transformation consistency, noise resistance, surprise adequacy, and uncertainty estimation. We compare the performance of our fitnesses with that of a traditional fitness function leveraging ground truth; further, we assess how the integration of a GAN not leveraging the ground truth impacts on test and retraining effectiveness.
  Our results suggest that leveraging transformation consistency is the best option to generate inputs for both DNN testing and retraining; it maximizes input diversity, spots the inputs leading to worse DNN performance, and leads to best DNN performance after retraining. Besides enabling simulator-based testing in the absence of ground truth, our findings pave the way for testing solutions that replace costly simulators with diffusion and large language models, which might be more affordable than simulators, but cannot generate ground-truth data.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Visible: Multispectral Vision-Language Learning for Earth Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models for Earth observation (EO) typically rely on the visual spectrum of data as the only model input, thus failing to leverage the rich spectral information available in the multispectral channels recorded by satellites. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Llama3-MS-CLIP, the first vision-language model pre-trained with contrastive learning on a large-scale multispectral dataset and report on the performance gains due to the extended spectral range. Furthermore, we present the largest-to-date image-caption dataset for multispectral data, consisting of one million Sentinel-2 samples and corresponding textual descriptions generated with Llama3-LLaVA-Next and Overture Maps data. We develop a scalable captioning pipeline, which is validated by domain experts. We evaluate Llama3-MS-CLIP on multispectral zero-shot image classification and retrieval using three datasets of varying complexity. Our results demonstrate that Llama3-MS-CLIP significantly outperforms other RGB-based approaches, improving classification accuracy by 6.77% on average and retrieval performance by 4.63% mAP compared to the second-best model. Our results emphasize the relevance of multispectral vision-language learning. We release the image-caption dataset, code, and model weights under an open-source license.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores optimizing transformer-based language models by integrating model compression techniques with inhibitor attention, a novel alternative attention mechanism. Inhibitor attention employs Manhattan distances and ReLU activations instead of the matrix multiplications and softmax activation of the conventional scaled dot-product attention. This shift offers potential computational and energy savings while maintaining model effectiveness. We propose further adjustments to improve the inhibitor mechanism's training efficiency and evaluate its performance on the DistilBERT architecture. Our knowledge distillation experiments indicate that the modified inhibitor transformer model can achieve competitive performance on standard NLP benchmarks, including General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) and sentiment analysis tasks.</description>

      <title>DIPLI: Deep Image Prior Lucky Imaging for Blind Astronomical Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary image restoration and super-resolution techniques effectively harness deep neural networks, markedly outperforming traditional methods. However, astrophotography presents unique challenges for deep learning due to limited training data. This work explores hybrid strategies, such as the Deep Image Prior (DIP) model, which facilitates blind training but is susceptible to overfitting, artifact generation, and instability when handling noisy images. We propose enhancements to the DIP model's baseline performance through several advanced techniques. First, we refine the model to process multiple frames concurrently, employing the Back Projection method and the TVNet model. Next, we adopt a Markov approach incorporating Monte Carlo estimation, Langevin dynamics, and a variational input technique to achieve unbiased estimates with minimal variance and counteract overfitting effectively. Collectively, these modifications reduce the likelihood of noise learning and mitigate loss function fluctuations during training, enhancing result stability. We validated our algorithm across multiple image sets of astronomical and celestial objects, achieving performance that not only mitigates limitations of Lucky Imaging, a classical computer vision technique that remains a standard in astronomical image reconstruction but surpasses the original DIP model, state of the art transformer- and diffusion-based models, underscoring the significance of our improvements.</description>

      <title>Autonomous AI imitators increase diversity in homogeneous information ecosystems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have facilitated autonomous AI agents capable of imitating human-generated content. This technological advancement raises fundamental questions about AI's potential impact on the diversity and democratic value of information ecosystems. Here, we introduce a large-scale simulation framework to examine AI-based imitation in news, a context critically influential for public discourse. By systematically testing two distinct imitation strategies across a range of information environments varying in initial diversity, we demonstrate that AI-generated articles do not uniformly homogenize content. Instead, AI's influence is strongly context-dependent: AI-generated articles can introduce valuable diversity in originally homogeneous news environments, while potentially diminishing diversity in contexts that initially display high heterogeneity. These results illustrate that the baseline diversity of an information space critically shapes AI's impact, challenging assumptions that AI-driven imitation uniformly threatens information diversity. Instead, when information is initially homogeneous, AI-driven imitation can expand perspectives, styles, and topics. This is especially important in news contexts, where information diversity fosters richer public debate by exposing citizens to alternative viewpoints, challenging biases, and preventing narrative monopolies, which is essential for a resilient democracy.</description>

      <title>The Lighthouse of Language: Enhancing LLM Agents via Critique-Guided Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently transformed from text-based assistants to autonomous agents capable of planning, reasoning, and iteratively improving their actions. While numerical reward signals and verifiers can effectively rank candidate actions, they often provide limited contextual guidance. In contrast, natural language feedback better aligns with the generative capabilities of LLMs, providing richer and more actionable suggestions. However, parsing and implementing this feedback effectively can be challenging for LLM-based agents. In this work, we introduce Critique-Guided Improvement (CGI), a novel two-player framework, comprising an actor model that explores an environment and a critic model that generates detailed nature language feedback. By training the critic to produce fine-grained assessments and actionable revisions, and the actor to utilize these critiques, our approach promotes more robust exploration of alternative strategies while avoiding local optima. Experiments in three interactive environments show that CGI outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin. Notably, even a small critic model surpasses GPT-4 in feedback quality. The resulting actor achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the power of explicit iterative guidance to enhance decision-making in LLM-based agents.</description>

      <title>Single Image Iterative Subject-driven Generation and Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalizing image generation and editing is particularly challenging when we only have a few images of the subject, or even a single image. A common approach to personalization is concept learning, which can integrate the subject into existing models relatively quickly, but produces images whose quality tends to deteriorate quickly when the number of subject images is small. Quality can be improved by pre-training an encoder, but training restricts generation to the training distribution, and is time consuming. It is still an open hard challenge to personalize image generation and editing from a single image without training. Here, we present SISO, a novel, training-free approach based on optimizing a similarity score with an input subject image. More specifically, SISO iteratively generates images and optimizes the model based on loss of similarity with the given subject image until a satisfactory level of similarity is achieved, allowing plug-and-play optimization to any image generator. We evaluated SISO in two tasks, image editing and image generation, using a diverse data set of personal subjects, and demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods in image quality, subject fidelity, and background preservation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been challenged by the computational overhead resulting from massive video frames, often alleviated through compression strategies. However, the visual content is not equally contributed to user instructions, existing strategies (\eg, average pool) inevitably lead to the loss of potentially useful information. To tackle this, we propose the Hybrid-level Instruction Injection Strategy for Conditional Token Compression in MLLMs (HICom), utilizing the instruction as a condition to guide the compression from both local and global levels. This encourages the compression to retain the maximum amount of user-focused information while reducing visual tokens to minimize computational burden. Specifically, the instruction condition is injected into the grouped visual tokens at the local level and the learnable tokens at the global level, and we conduct the attention mechanism to complete the conditional compression. From the hybrid-level compression, the instruction-relevant visual parts are highlighted while the temporal-spatial structure is also preserved for easier understanding of LLMs. To further unleash the potential of HICom, we introduce a new conditional pre-training stage with our proposed dataset HICom-248K. Experiments show that our HICom can obtain distinguished video understanding ability with fewer tokens, increasing the performance by 2.43\% average on three multiple-choice QA benchmarks and saving 78.8\% tokens compared with the SOTA method. The code is available at https://github.com/lntzm/HICom.</description>

      <title>Incomplete Utterance Rewriting with Editing Operation Guidance and Utterance Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although existing fashionable generation methods on Incomplete Utterance Rewriting (IUR) can generate coherent utterances, they often result in the inclusion of irrelevant and redundant tokens in rewritten utterances due to their inability to focus on critical tokens in dialogue context. Furthermore, the limited size of the training datasets also contributes to the insufficient training of the IUR model. To address the first issue, we propose a multi-task learning framework EO-IUR (Editing Operation-guided Incomplete Utterance Rewriting) that introduces the editing operation labels generated by sequence labeling module to guide generation model to focus on critical tokens. Furthermore, we introduce a token-level heterogeneous graph to represent dialogues. To address the second issue, we propose a two-dimensional utterance augmentation strategy, namely editing operation-based incomplete utterance augmentation and LLM-based historical utterance augmentation. The experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that our EO-IUR outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in both open-domain and task-oriented dialogue. The code will be available at https://github.com/Dewset/EO-IUR.</description>

      <title>Temporal-Spatial Attention Network (TSAN) for DoS Attack Detection in Network Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks remain a critical threat to network security, disrupting services and causing significant economic losses. Traditional detection methods, including statistical and rule-based models, struggle to adapt to evolving attack patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Temporal-Spatial Attention Network (TSAN) architecture for detecting Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in network traffic. By leveraging both temporal and spatial features of network traffic, our approach captures complex traffic patterns and anomalies that traditional methods might miss. The TSAN model incorporates transformer-based temporal encoding, convolutional spatial encoding, and a cross-attention mechanism to fuse these complementary feature spaces. Additionally, we employ multi-task learning with auxiliary tasks to enhance the model's robustness. Experimental results on the NSL-KDD dataset demonstrate that TSAN outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time deployment. The proposed architecture offers an optimal balance between detection accuracy and computational overhead, making it highly suitable for real-world network security applications.</description>

      <title>Expert Race: A Flexible Routing Strategy for Scaling Diffusion Transformer with Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as mainstream framework in visual generation. Building upon this success, the integration of Mixture of Experts (MoE) methods has shown promise in enhancing model scalability and performance. In this paper, we introduce Race-DiT, a novel MoE model for diffusion transformers with a flexible routing strategy, Expert Race. By allowing tokens and experts to compete together and select the top candidates, the model learns to dynamically assign experts to critical tokens. Additionally, we propose per-layer regularization to address challenges in shallow layer learning, and router similarity loss to prevent mode collapse, ensuring better expert utilization. Extensive experiments on ImageNet validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing significant performance gains while promising scaling properties.</description>

      <title>Two-stage Incomplete Utterance Rewriting on Editing Operation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous work on Incomplete Utterance Rewriting (IUR) has primarily focused on generating rewritten utterances based solely on dialogue context, ignoring the widespread phenomenon of coreference and ellipsis in dialogues. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework called TEO (\emph{Two-stage approach on Editing Operation}) for IUR, in which the first stage generates editing operations and the second stage rewrites incomplete utterances utilizing the generated editing operations and the dialogue context. Furthermore, an adversarial perturbation strategy is proposed to mitigate cascading errors and exposure bias caused by the inconsistency between training and inference in the second stage. Experimental results on three IUR datasets show that our TEO outperforms the SOTA models significantly.</description>

      <title>PromptHash: Affinity-Prompted Collaborative Cross-Modal Learning for Adaptive Hashing Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-modal hashing is a promising approach for efficient data retrieval and storage optimization. However, contemporary methods exhibit significant limitations in semantic preservation, contextual integrity, and information redundancy, which constrains retrieval efficacy. We present PromptHash, an innovative framework leveraging affinity prompt-aware collaborative learning for adaptive cross-modal hashing. We propose an end-to-end framework for affinity-prompted collaborative hashing, with the following fundamental technical contributions: (i) a text affinity prompt learning mechanism that preserves contextual information while maintaining parameter efficiency, (ii) an adaptive gated selection fusion architecture that synthesizes State Space Model with Transformer network for precise cross-modal feature integration, and (iii) a prompt affinity alignment strategy that bridges modal heterogeneity through hierarchical contrastive learning. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first investigation into affinity prompt awareness within collaborative cross-modal adaptive hash learning, establishing a paradigm for enhanced semantic consistency across modalities. Through comprehensive evaluation on three benchmark multi-label datasets, PromptHash demonstrates substantial performance improvements over existing approaches. Notably, on the NUS-WIDE dataset, our method achieves significant gains of 18.22% and 18.65% in image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval tasks, respectively. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ShiShuMo/PromptHash.</description>

      <title>Tuning LLMs by RAG Principles: Towards LLM-native Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory, additional information beyond the training of large language models (LLMs), is crucial to various real-world applications, such as personal assistant. The two mainstream solutions to incorporate memory into the generation process are long-context LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we first systematically compare these two types of solutions on three renovated/new datasets and show that (1) long-context solutions, although more expensive, shall be easier to capture the big picture and better answer queries which require considering the memory as a whole; and (2) when the queries concern specific information, RAG solutions shall be more competitive especially when the keywords can be explicitly matched. Therefore, we propose a novel method RAG-Tuned-LLM which fine-tunes a relative small (e.g., 7B) LLM using the data generated following the RAG principles, so it can combine the advantages of both solutions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RAG-Tuned-LLM can beat long-context LLMs and RAG methods across a wide range of query types.</description>

      <title>Redefining Toxicity: An Objective and Context-Aware Approach for Stress-Level-Based Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental problem of toxicity detection lies in the fact that the term "toxicity" is ill-defined. Such uncertainty causes researchers to rely on subjective and vague data during model training, which leads to non-robust and inaccurate results, following the 'garbage in - garbage out' paradigm. This study introduces a novel, objective, and context-aware framework for toxicity detection, leveraging stress levels as a key determinant of toxicity. We propose new definition, metric and training approach as a parts of our framework and demonstrate it's effectiveness using a dataset we collected.</description>

      <title>3-D Image-to-Image Fusion in Lightsheet Microscopy by Two-Step Adversarial Network: Contribution to the FuseMyCells Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lightsheet microscopy is a powerful 3-D imaging technique that addresses limitations of traditional optical and confocal microscopy but suffers from a low penetration depth and reduced image quality at greater depths. Multiview lightsheet microscopy improves 3-D resolution by combining multiple views but simultaneously increasing the complexity and the photon budget, leading to potential photobleaching and phototoxicity. The FuseMyCells challenge, organized in conjunction with the IEEE ISBI 2025 conference, aims to benchmark deep learning-based solutions for fusing high-quality 3-D volumes from single 3-D views, potentially simplifying procedures and conserving the photon budget. In this work, we propose a contribution to the FuseMyCells challenge based on a two-step procedure. The first step processes a downsampled version of the image to capture the entire region of interest, while the second step uses a patch-based approach for high-resolution inference, incorporating adversarial loss to enhance visual outcomes. This method addresses challenges related to high data resolution, the necessity of global context, and the preservation of high-frequency details. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential to improve 3-D image fusion quality and extend the capabilities of lightsheet microscopy. The average SSIM for the nucleus and membranes is greater than 0.85 and 0.91, respectively.</description>

      <title>Allostatic Control of Persistent States in Spiking Neural Networks for perception and computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel model for updating perceptual beliefs about the environment by extending the concept of Allostasis to the control of internal representations. Allostasis is a fundamental regulatory mechanism observed in animal physiology that orchestrates responses to maintain a dynamic equilibrium in bodily needs and internal states. In this paper, we focus on an application in numerical cognition, where a bump of activity in an attractor network is used as a spatial numerical representation. While existing neural networks can maintain persistent states, to date, there is no unified framework for dynamically controlling spatial changes in neuronal activity in response to environmental changes. To address this, we couple a well known allostatic microcircuit, the Hammel model, with a ring attractor, resulting in a Spiking Neural Network architecture that can modulate the location of the bump as a function of some reference input. This localized activity in turn is used as a perceptual belief in a simulated subitization task a quick enumeration process without counting. We provide a general procedure to fine-tune the model and demonstrate the successful control of the bump location. We also study the response time in the model with respect to changes in parameters and compare it with biological data. Finally, we analyze the dynamics of the network to understand the selectivity and specificity of different neurons to distinct categories present in the input. The results of this paper, particularly the mechanism for moving persistent states, are not limited to numerical cognition but can be applied to a wide range of tasks involving similar representations.</description>

      <title>AIMI: Leveraging Future Knowledge and Personalization in Sparse Event Forecasting for Treatment Adherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adherence to prescribed treatments is crucial for individuals with chronic conditions to avoid costly or adverse health outcomes. For certain patient groups, intensive lifestyle interventions are vital for enhancing medication adherence. Accurate forecasting of treatment adherence can open pathways to developing an on-demand intervention tool, enabling timely and personalized support. With the increasing popularity of smartphones and wearables, it is now easier than ever to develop and deploy smart activity monitoring systems. However, effective forecasting systems for treatment adherence based on wearable sensors are still not widely available. We close this gap by proposing Adherence Forecasting and Intervention with Machine Intelligence (AIMI). AIMI is a knowledge-guided adherence forecasting system that leverages smartphone sensors and previous medication history to estimate the likelihood of forgetting to take a prescribed medication. A user study was conducted with 27 participants who took daily medications to manage their cardiovascular diseases. We designed and developed CNN and LSTM-based forecasting models with various combinations of input features and found that LSTM models can forecast medication adherence with an accuracy of 0.932 and an F-1 score of 0.936. Moreover, through a series of ablation studies involving convolutional and recurrent neural network architectures, we demonstrate that leveraging known knowledge about future and personalized training enhances the accuracy of medication adherence forecasting.

      <description>arXiv:2503.16112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional video compression algorithms exhibit significant quality degradation at extremely low bitrates. Promptus emerges as a new paradigm for video streaming, substantially cutting down the bandwidth essential for video streaming. However, Promptus is computationally intensive and can not run in real-time on mobile devices. This paper presents PromptMobile, an efficient acceleration framework tailored for on-device Promptus. Specifically, we propose (1) a two-stage efficient generation framework to reduce computational cost by 8.1x, (2) a fine-grained inter-frame caching to reduce redundant computations by 16.6\%, (3) system-level optimizations to further enhance efficiency. The evaluations demonstrate that compared with the original Promptus, PromptMobile achieves a 13.6x increase in image generation speed. Compared with other streaming methods, PromptMobile achives an average LPIPS improvement of 0.016 (compared with H.265), reducing 60\% of severely distorted frames (compared to VQGAN).</description>

      <title>Unify and Triumph: Polyglot, Diverse, and Self-Consistent Generation of Unit Tests with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based test generation has gained attention in software engineering, yet most studies evaluate LLMs' ability to generate unit tests in a single attempt for a given language, missing the opportunity to leverage LLM diversity for more robust testing. This paper introduces PolyTest, a novel approach that enhances test generation by exploiting polyglot and temperature-controlled diversity. PolyTest systematically leverages these properties in two complementary ways: (1) Cross-lingual test generation, where tests are generated in multiple languages at zero temperature and then unified; (2) Diverse test sampling, where multiple test sets are generated within the same language at a higher temperature before unification. A key insight is that LLMs can generate diverse yet contradicting tests -- same input, different expected outputs -- across languages and generations. PolyTest mitigates inconsistencies by unifying test sets, fostering self-consistency and improving overall test quality. Unlike single-language or single-attempt approaches, PolyTest enhances testing without requiring on-the-fly execution, making it particularly beneficial for weaker-performing languages. We evaluate PolyTest on Llama3-70B, GPT-4o, and GPT-3.5 using EvalPlus, generating tests in five languages (Java, C, Python, JavaScript, and a CSV-based format) at temperature 0 and sampling multiple sets at temperature 1. We observe that LLMs frequently generate contradicting tests across settings, and that PolyTest significantly improves test quality across all considered metrics -- number of tests, passing rate, statement/branch coverage (up to +9.01%), and mutation score (up to +11.23%). Finally, PolyTest outperforms Pynguin in test generation, passing rate, and mutation score.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) are a class of NP-hard problems ubiquitous in several real-world logistics scenarios that pose significant challenges for optimization. Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has emerged as a promising alternative to classical approaches, as it can learn fast heuristics to solve VRPs. However, most research works in NCO for VRPs focus on simplified settings, which do not account for asymmetric distances and travel durations that cannot be derived by simple Euclidean distances and unrealistic data distributions, hindering real-world deployment. This work introduces RRNCO (Real Routing NCO) to bridge the gap of NCO between synthetic and real-world VRPs in the critical aspects of both data and modeling. First, we introduce a new, openly available dataset with real-world data containing a diverse dataset of locations, distances, and duration matrices from 100 cities, considering realistic settings with actual routing distances and durations obtained from Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM). Second, we propose a novel approach that efficiently processes both node and edge features through contextual gating, enabling the construction of more informed node embedding, and we finally incorporate an Adaptation Attention Free Module (AAFM) with neural adaptive bias mechanisms that effectively integrates not only distance matrices but also angular relationships between nodes, allowing our model to capture rich structural information. RRNCO achieves state-of-the-art results in real-world VRPs among NCO methods. We make our dataset and code publicly available at https://github.com/ai4co/real-routing-nco.</description>

      <title>Towards Lighter and Robust Evaluation for Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models are prompting us to view more NLP tasks from a generative perspective. At the same time, they offer a new way of accessing information, mainly through the RAG framework. While there have been notable improvements for the autoregressive models, overcoming hallucination in the generated answers remains a continuous problem. A standard solution is to use commercial LLMs, such as GPT4, to evaluate these algorithms. However, such frameworks are expensive and not very transparent. Therefore, we propose a study which demonstrates the interest of open-weight models for evaluating RAG hallucination. We develop a lightweight approach using smaller, quantized LLMs to provide an accessible and interpretable metric that gives continuous scores for the generated answer with respect to their correctness and faithfulness. This score allows us to question decisions' reliability and explore thresholds to develop a new AUC metric as an alternative to correlation with human judgment.</description>

      <title>Accurate Scene Text Recognition with Efficient Model Scaling and Cloze Self-Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling architectures have been proven effective for improving Scene Text Recognition (STR), but the individual contribution of vision encoder and text decoder scaling remain under-explored. In this work, we present an in-depth empirical analysis and demonstrate that, contrary to previous observations, scaling the decoder yields significant performance gains, always exceeding those achieved by encoder scaling alone. We also identify label noise as a key challenge in STR, particularly in real-world data, which can limit the effectiveness of STR models. To address this, we propose Cloze Self-Distillation (CSD), a method that mitigates label noise by distilling a student model from context-aware soft predictions and pseudolabels generated by a teacher model. Additionally, we enhance the decoder architecture by introducing differential cross-attention for STR. Our methodology achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 out of 11 benchmarks using only real data, while significantly reducing the parameter size and computational costs.</description>

      <title>MathFusion: Enhancing Mathematic Problem-solving of LLM through Instruction Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive progress in mathematical reasoning. While data augmentation is promising to enhance mathematical problem-solving ability, current approaches are predominantly limited to instance-level modifications-such as rephrasing or generating syntactic variations-which fail to capture and leverage the intrinsic relational structures inherent in mathematical knowledge. Inspired by human learning processes, where mathematical proficiency develops through systematic exposure to interconnected concepts, we introduce MathFusion, a novel framework that enhances mathematical reasoning through cross-problem instruction synthesis. MathFusion implements this through three fusion strategies: (1) sequential fusion, which chains related problems to model solution dependencies; (2) parallel fusion, which combines analogous problems to reinforce conceptual understanding; and (3) conditional fusion, which creates context-aware selective problems to enhance reasoning flexibility. By applying these strategies, we generate a new dataset, \textbf{MathFusionQA}, followed by fine-tuning models (DeepSeekMath-7B, Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B) on it. Experimental results demonstrate that MathFusion achieves substantial improvements in mathematical reasoning while maintaining high data efficiency, boosting performance by 18.0 points in accuracy across diverse benchmarks while requiring only 45K additional synthetic instructions, representing a substantial improvement over traditional single-instruction approaches. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/QizhiPei/mathfusion.</description>

      <title>Flight Testing an Optionally Piloted Aircraft: a Case Study on Trust Dynamics in Human-Autonomy Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines how trust is formed, maintained, or diminished over time in the context of human-autonomy teaming with an optionally piloted aircraft. Whereas traditional factor-based trust models offer a static representation of human confidence in technology, here we discuss how variations in the underlying factors lead to variations in trust, trust thresholds, and human behaviours. Over 200 hours of flight test data collected over a multi-year test campaign from 2021 to 2023 were reviewed. The dispositional-situational-learned, process-performance-purpose, and IMPACTS homeostasis trust models are applied to illuminate trust trends during nominal autonomous flight operations. The results offer promising directions for future studies on trust dynamics and design-for-trust in human-autonomy teaming.</description>

      <title>AI Agents in Cryptoland: Practical Attacks and No Silver Bullet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of AI agents with Web3 ecosystems harnesses their complementary potential for autonomy and openness, yet also introduces underexplored security risks, as these agents dynamically interact with financial protocols and immutable smart contracts. This paper investigates the vulnerabilities of AI agents within blockchain-based financial ecosystems when exposed to adversarial threats in real-world scenarios. We introduce the concept of context manipulation -- a comprehensive attack vector that exploits unprotected context surfaces, including input channels, memory modules, and external data feeds. Through empirical analysis of ElizaOS, a decentralized AI agent framework for automated Web3 operations, we demonstrate how adversaries can manipulate context by injecting malicious instructions into prompts or historical interaction records, leading to unintended asset transfers and protocol violations which could be financially devastating. Our findings indicate that prompt-based defenses are insufficient, as malicious inputs can corrupt an agent's stored context, creating cascading vulnerabilities across interactions and platforms. This research highlights the urgent need to develop AI agents that are both secure and fiduciarily responsible.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-augmented Graph Contrastive Learning for Collaborative Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph-based collaborative filtering has been established as a prominent approach in recommendation systems, leveraging the inherent graph topology of user-item interactions to model high-order connectivity patterns and enhance recommendation performance. Recent advances in Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) have demonstrated promising potential to alleviate data sparsity issues by improving representation learning through contrastive view generation and mutual information maximization. However, existing approaches lack effective data augmentation strategies. Structural augmentation risks distorting fundamental graph topology, while feature-level perturbation techniques predominantly employ uniform noise scales that fail to account for node-specific characteristics. To solve these challenges, we propose Diffusion-augmented Contrastive Learning (DGCL), an innovative framework that integrates diffusion models with contrastive learning for enhanced collaborative filtering. Our approach employs a diffusion process that learns node-specific Gaussian distributions of representations, thereby generating semantically consistent yet diversified contrastive views through reverse diffusion sampling. DGCL facilitates adaptive data augmentation based on reconstructed representations, considering both semantic coherence and node-specific features. In addition, it explores unrepresented regions of the latent sparse feature space, thereby enriching the diversity of contrastive views. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DGCL on three public datasets.</description>

      <title>Unleashing Vecset Diffusion Model for Fast Shape Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D shape generation has greatly flourished through the development of so-called "native" 3D diffusion, particularly through the Vecset Diffusion Model (VDM). While recent advancements have shown promising results in generating high-resolution 3D shapes, VDM still struggles with high-speed generation. Challenges exist because of difficulties not only in accelerating diffusion sampling but also VAE decoding in VDM, areas under-explored in previous works. To address these challenges, we present FlashVDM, a systematic framework for accelerating both VAE and DiT in VDM. For DiT, FlashVDM enables flexible diffusion sampling with as few as 5 inference steps and comparable quality, which is made possible by stabilizing consistency distillation with our newly introduced Progressive Flow Distillation. For VAE, we introduce a lightning vecset decoder equipped with Adaptive KV Selection, Hierarchical Volume Decoding, and Efficient Network Design. By exploiting the locality of the vecset and the sparsity of shape surface in the volume, our decoder drastically lowers FLOPs, minimizing the overall decoding overhead. We apply FlashVDM to Hunyuan3D-2 to obtain Hunyuan3D-2 Turbo. Through systematic evaluation, we show that our model significantly outperforms existing fast 3D generation methods, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art while reducing inference time by over 45x for reconstruction and 32x for generation.

      <title>Bridging Technology and Humanities: Evaluating the Impact of Large Language Models on Social Sciences Research with DeepSeek-R1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has made significant breakthroughs in the field of natural language processing and has gradually been applied to the field of humanities and social sciences research. LLMs have a wide range of application value in the field of humanities and social sciences because of its strong text understanding, generation and reasoning capabilities. In humanities and social sciences research, LLMs can analyze large-scale text data and make inferences.
  This article analyzes the large language model DeepSeek-R1 from seven aspects: low-resource language translation, educational question-answering, student writing improvement in higher education, logical reasoning, educational measurement and psychometrics, public health policy analysis, and art education.Then we compare the answers given by DeepSeek-R1 in the seven aspects with the answers given by o1-preview. DeepSeek-R1 performs well in the humanities and social sciences, answering most questions correctly and logically, and can give reasonable analysis processes and explanations. Compared with o1-preview, it can automatically generate reasoning processes and provide more detailed explanations, which is suitable for beginners or people who need to have a detailed understanding of this knowledge, while o1-preview is more suitable for quick reading.
  Through analysis, it is found that LLM has broad application potential in the field of humanities and social sciences, and shows great advantages in improving text analysis efficiency, language communication and other fields. LLM's powerful language understanding and generation capabilities enable it to deeply explore complex problems in the field of humanities and social sciences, and provide innovative tools for academic research and practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masked modeling has emerged as a powerful self-supervised learning framework, but existing methods largely rely on random masking, disregarding the structural properties of different modalities. In this work, we introduce structured noise-based masking, a simple yet effective approach that naturally aligns with the spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics of video and audio data. By filtering white noise into distinct color noise distributions, we generate structured masks that preserve modality-specific patterns without requiring handcrafted heuristics or access to the data. Our approach improves the performance of masked video and audio modeling frameworks without any computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that structured noise masking achieves consistent improvement over random masking for standard and advanced masked modeling methods, highlighting the importance of modality-aware masking strategies for representation learning.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-guided machine learning model with soil moisture for corn yield prediction under drought conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) techniques, by enabling non-contact acquisition of extensive ground observations, have become a valuable tool for corn yield prediction. Traditional process-based (PB) models are limited by fixed input features and struggle to incorporate large volumes of RS data. In contrast, machine learning (ML) models are often criticized for being ``black boxes'' with limited interpretability. To address these limitations, we used Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML), which combined the strengths of both approaches and fully used RS data. However, previous KGML methods overlooked the crucial role of soil moisture in plant growth. To bridge this gap, we proposed the Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning with Soil Moisture (KGML-SM) framework, using soil moisture as an intermediate variable to emphasize its key role in plant development. Additionally, based on the prior knowledge that the model may overestimate under drought conditions, we designed a drought-aware loss function that penalizes predicted yield in drought-affected areas. Our experiments showed that the KGML-SM model outperformed other ML models. Finally, we explored the relationships between drought, soil moisture, and corn yield prediction, assessing the importance of various features and analyzing how soil moisture impacts corn yield predictions across different regions and time periods.</description>

      <title>HiQ-Lip: The First Quantum-Classical Hierarchical Method for Global Lipschitz Constant Estimation of ReLU Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the global Lipschitz constant of neural networks is crucial for understanding and improving their robustness and generalization capabilities. However, precise calculations are NP-hard, and current semidefinite programming (SDP) methods face challenges such as high memory usage and slow processing speeds. In this paper, we propose \textbf{HiQ-Lip}, a hybrid quantum-classical hierarchical method that leverages Coherent Ising Machines (CIMs) to estimate the global Lipschitz constant. We tackle the estimation by converting it into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and implement a multilevel graph coarsening and refinement strategy to adapt to the constraints of contemporary quantum hardware. Our experimental evaluations on fully connected neural networks demonstrate that HiQ-Lip not only provides estimates comparable to state-of-the-art methods but also significantly accelerates the computation process. In specific tests involving two-layer neural networks with 256 hidden neurons, HiQ-Lip doubles the solving speed and offers more accurate upper bounds than the existing best method, LiPopt. These findings highlight the promising utility of small-scale quantum devices in advancing the estimation of neural network robustness.</description>

      <title>CaKE: Circuit-aware Editing Enables Generalizable Knowledge Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) enables the modification of outdated or incorrect information in large language models (LLMs). While existing KE methods can update isolated facts, they struggle to generalize these updates to multi-hop reasoning tasks that depend on the modified knowledge. Through an analysis of reasoning circuits -- the neural pathways LLMs use for knowledge-based inference, we observe that current layer-localized KE approaches, such as MEMIT and WISE, which edit only single or a few model layers, struggle to effectively incorporate updated information into these reasoning pathways. To address this limitation, we propose CaKE (Circuit-aware Knowledge Editing), a novel method that enables more effective integration of updated knowledge in LLMs. CaKE leverages strategically curated data, guided by our circuits-based analysis, that enforces the model to utilize the modified knowledge, stimulating the model to develop appropriate reasoning circuits for newly integrated knowledge. Experimental results show that CaKE enables more accurate and consistent use of updated knowledge across related reasoning tasks, leading to an average of 20% improvement in multi-hop reasoning accuracy on MQuAKE dataset compared to existing KE methods. We release the code and data in https://github.com/zjunlp/CaKE.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the algebra of quantum idempotents and the quantization of fermions which gives rise to a Hilbert space equal to the Grassmann algebra associated with the Lie algebra. Since idempotents carry representations of the algebra under consideration, they form algebraic varieties and smooth manifolds in the natural topology. In addition to the motivation of linking up mathematical physics with machine learning, it is also shown that by using idempotents and invariant subspace of the corresponding algebras, these representations encode and perhaps provide a probabilistic interpretation of reasoning and relational paths in geometrical terms.</description>

      <title>JARVIS-VLA: Post-Training Large-Scale Vision Language Models to Play Visual Games with Keyboards and Mouse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, action-based decision-making in open-world environments has gained significant attention. Visual Language Action (VLA) models, pretrained on large-scale web datasets, have shown promise in decision-making tasks. However, previous work has primarily focused on action post-training, often neglecting enhancements to the foundational model itself. In response, we introduce a novel approach, Act from Visual Language Post-Training, which refines Visual Language Models (VLMs) through visual and linguistic guidance in a self-supervised manner. This enhancement improves the models' capabilities in world knowledge, visual recognition, and spatial grounding in open-world environments. Following the above post-training paradigms, we obtain the first VLA models in Minecraft that can follow human instructions on over 1k different atomic tasks, including crafting, smelting, cooking, mining, and killing. Our experiments demonstrate that post-training on non-trajectory tasks leads to a significant 40% improvement over the best agent baseline on a diverse set of atomic tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses traditional imitation learning-based policies in Minecraft, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We have open-sourced the code, models, and datasets to foster further research. The project page can be found in https://craftjarvis.github.io/JarvisVLA.</description>

      <title>Attentional Triple-Encoder Network in Spatiospectral Domains for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) segmentation is essential for diagnosing pathology. Traditional methods focus on either spatial or spectral domains, overlooking their combined dependencies. We propose a triple-encoder network that integrates CNNs for spatial features, Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) for spectral features, and attention mechanisms to capture global relationships across both domains. Attention fusion modules integrate convolution and cross-attention to further enhance features. Our method achieves an average Dice score improvement from 0.855 to 0.864, outperforming prior work.</description>

      <title>Graph of Effort: Quantifying Risk of AI Usage for Vulnerability Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With AI-based software becoming widely available, the risk of exploiting its capabilities, such as high automation and complex pattern recognition, could significantly increase. An AI used offensively to attack non-AI assets is referred to as offensive AI.
  Current research explores how offensive AI can be utilized and how its usage can be classified. Additionally, methods for threat modeling are being developed for AI-based assets within organizations. However, there are gaps that need to be addressed. Firstly, there is a need to quantify the factors contributing to the AI threat. Secondly, there is a requirement to create threat models that analyze the risk of being attacked by AI for vulnerability assessment across all assets of an organization. This is particularly crucial and challenging in cloud environments, where sophisticated infrastructure and access control landscapes are prevalent. The ability to quantify and further analyze the threat posed by offensive AI enables analysts to rank vulnerabilities and prioritize the implementation of proactive countermeasures.
  To address these gaps, this paper introduces the Graph of Effort, an intuitive, flexible, and effective threat modeling method for analyzing the effort required to use offensive AI for vulnerability exploitation by an adversary. While the threat model is functional and provides valuable support, its design choices need further empirical validation in future work.</description>

      <title>Do Visual Imaginations Improve Vision-and-Language Navigation Agents?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents are tasked with navigating an unseen environment using natural language instructions. In this work, we study if visual representations of sub-goals implied by the instructions can serve as navigational cues and lead to increased navigation performance. To synthesize these visual representations or imaginations, we leverage a text-to-image diffusion model on landmark references contained in segmented instructions. These imaginations are provided to VLN agents as an added modality to act as landmark cues and an auxiliary loss is added to explicitly encourage relating these with their corresponding referring expressions. Our findings reveal an increase in success rate (SR) of around 1 point and up to 0.5 points in success scaled by inverse path length (SPL) across agents. These results suggest that the proposed approach reinforces visual understanding compared to relying on language instructions alone.

      <title>SA-Occ: Satellite-Assisted 3D Occupancy Prediction in Real World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing vision-based 3D occupancy prediction methods are inherently limited in accuracy due to their exclusive reliance on street-view imagery, neglecting the potential benefits of incorporating satellite views. We propose SA-Occ, the first Satellite-Assisted 3D occupancy prediction model, which leverages GPS &amp; IMU to integrate historical yet readily available satellite imagery into real-time applications, effectively mitigating limitations of ego-vehicle perceptions, involving occlusions and degraded performance in distant regions. To address the core challenges of cross-view perception, we propose: 1) Dynamic-Decoupling Fusion, which resolves inconsistencies in dynamic regions caused by the temporal asynchrony between satellite and street views; 2) 3D-Proj Guidance, a module that enhances 3D feature extraction from inherently 2D satellite imagery; and 3) Uniform Sampling Alignment, which aligns the sampling density between street and satellite views. Evaluated on Occ3D-nuScenes, SA-Occ achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially among single-frame methods, with a 39.05% mIoU (a 6.97% improvement), while incurring only 6.93 ms of additional latency per frame. Our code and newly curated dataset are available at https://github.com/chenchen235/SA-Occ.</description>

      <title>RoboFactory: Exploring Embodied Agent Collaboration with Compositional Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing effective embodied multi-agent systems is critical for solving complex real-world tasks across domains. Due to the complexity of multi-agent embodied systems, existing methods fail to automatically generate safe and efficient training data for such systems. To this end, we propose the concept of compositional constraints for embodied multi-agent systems, addressing the challenges arising from collaboration among embodied agents. We design various interfaces tailored to different types of constraints, enabling seamless interaction with the physical world. Leveraging compositional constraints and specifically designed interfaces, we develop an automated data collection framework for embodied multi-agent systems and introduce the first benchmark for embodied multi-agent manipulation, RoboFactory. Based on RoboFactory benchmark, we adapt and evaluate the method of imitation learning and analyzed its performance in different difficulty agent tasks. Furthermore, we explore the architectures and training strategies for multi-agent imitation learning, aiming to build safe and efficient embodied multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>DreamTexture: Shape from Virtual Texture with Analysis by Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DreamFusion established a new paradigm for unsupervised 3D reconstruction from virtual views by combining advances in generative models and differentiable rendering. However, the underlying multi-view rendering, along with supervision from large-scale generative models, is computationally expensive and under-constrained. We propose DreamTexture, a novel Shape-from-Virtual-Texture approach that leverages monocular depth cues to reconstruct 3D objects. Our method textures an input image by aligning a virtual texture with the real depth cues in the input, exploiting the inherent understanding of monocular geometry encoded in modern diffusion models. We then reconstruct depth from the virtual texture deformation with a new conformal map optimization, which alleviates memory-intensive volumetric representations. Our experiments reveal that generative models possess an understanding of monocular shape cues, which can be extracted by augmenting and aligning texture cues -- a novel monocular reconstruction paradigm that we call Analysis by Augmentation.</description>

      <title>MagicMotion: Controllable Video Generation with Dense-to-Sparse Trajectory Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have led to remarkable improvements in visual quality and temporal coherence. Upon this, trajectory-controllable video generation has emerged to enable precise object motion control through explicitly defined spatial paths. However, existing methods struggle with complex object movements and multi-object motion control, resulting in imprecise trajectory adherence, poor object consistency, and compromised visual quality. Furthermore, these methods only support trajectory control in a single format, limiting their applicability in diverse scenarios. Additionally, there is no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for trajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and systematic evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce MagicMotion, a novel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control through three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes, and sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly animates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object consistency and visual quality. Furthermore, we present MagicData, a large-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. We also introduce MagicBench, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses both video quality and trajectory control accuracy across different numbers of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicMotion outperforms previous methods across various metrics.

      <title>Relational Object-Centric Actor-Critic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advances in unsupervised object-centric representation learning have significantly improved its application to downstream tasks. Recent works highlight that disentangled object representations can aid policy learning in image-based, object-centric reinforcement learning tasks. This paper proposes a novel object-centric reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates actor-critic and model-based approaches by incorporating an object-centric world model within the critic. The world model captures the environment's data-generating process by predicting the next state and reward given the current state-action pair, where actions are interventions in the environment. In model-based reinforcement learning, world model learning can be interpreted as a causal induction problem, where the agent must learn the causal relationships underlying the environment's dynamics. We evaluate our method in a simulated 3D robotic environment and a 2D environment with compositional structure. As baselines, we compare against object-centric, model-free actor-critic algorithms and a state-of-the-art monolithic model-based algorithm. While the baselines show comparable performance in easier tasks, our approach outperforms them in more challenging scenarios with a large number of objects or more complex dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Diagnosis and Treatment of Liver Diseases: Integrating Batch Processing, Rule-Based Event Detection and Explainable Artificial Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liver diseases pose a significant global health burden, impacting many individuals and having substantial economic and social consequences. Rising liver problems are considered a fatal disease in many countries, such as Egypt and Moldova. This study aims to develop a diagnosis and treatment model for liver disease using Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), Patient Clinical Data (PCD) ontology, and detection rules derived from a decision tree algorithm. For the development of the ontology, the National Viral Hepatitis Control Program (NVHCP) guidelines were used, which made the ontology more accurate and reliable. The Apache Jena framework uses batch processing to detect events based on these rules. Based on the event detected, queries can be directly processed using SPARQL. We convert these Decision Tree (DT) and medical guidelines-based rules into Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to operationalize the ontology. Using this SWRL in the ontology to predict different types of liver disease with the help of the Pellet and Drools inference engines in Protege Tools, a total of 615 records were taken from different liver diseases. After inferring the rules, the result can be generated for the patient according to the rules, and other patient-related details, along with different precautionary suggestions, can be obtained based on these results. These rules can make suggestions more accurate with the help of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) with open API-based suggestions. When the patient has prescribed a medical test, the model accommodates this result using optical character recognition (OCR), and the same process applies when the patient has prescribed a further medical suggestion according to the test report. These models combine to form a comprehensive Decision Support System (DSS) for the diagnosis of liver disease.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on Process-Oriented Automatic Text Summarization with Exploration of LLM-Based Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic Text Summarization (ATS), utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms, aims to create concise and accurate summaries, thereby significantly reducing the human effort required in processing large volumes of text. ATS has drawn considerable interest in both academic and industrial circles. Many studies have been conducted in the past to survey ATS methods; however, they generally lack practicality for real-world implementations, as they often categorize previous methods from a theoretical standpoint. Moreover, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has altered conventional ATS methods. In this survey, we aim to 1) provide a comprehensive overview of ATS from a ``Process-Oriented Schema'' perspective, which is best aligned with real-world implementations; 2) comprehensively review the latest LLM-based ATS works; and 3) deliver an up-to-date survey of ATS, bridging the two-year gap in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey to specifically investigate LLM-based ATS methods.</description>

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist teachers and students in educational tasks is receiving increasing attention. In this paper, we assess ChatGPT's capacities to solve and grade real programming exams, from an accredited BSc degree in Computer Science, written in Spanish. Our findings suggest that this AI model is only effective for solving simple coding tasks. Its proficiency in tackling complex problems or evaluating solutions authored by others are far from effective. As part of this research, we also release a new corpus of programming tasks and the corresponding prompts for solving the problems or grading the solutions. This resource can be further exploited by other research teams.</description>

Abstract: To address the sycophancy problem caused by reinforcement learning from human feedback in large language models, this research applies synthetic data intervention technology to the decoder-only transformer architecture. Based on the research gaps in the existing literature, the researcher designed an experimental process to reduce the tendency of models to cater by generating diversified data, and used GPT4o as an experimental tool for verification. The experiment used 100 true and false questions, and compared the performance of the model trained with synthetic data intervention and the original untrained model on multiple indicators. The results show that the SDI training model supports the technology in terms of accuracy rate and sycophancy rate and has significant effectiveness in reducing sycophancy phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthogonal convolutional layers are the workhorse of multiple areas in machine learning, such as adversarial robustness, normalizing flows, GANs, and Lipschitzconstrained models. Their ability to preserve norms and ensure stable gradient propagation makes them valuable for a large range of problems. Despite their promise, the deployment of orthogonal convolution in large-scale applications is a significant challenge due to computational overhead and limited support for modern features like strides, dilations, group convolutions, and transposed convolutions.In this paper, we introduce AOC (Adaptative Orthogonal Convolution), a scalable method for constructing orthogonal convolutions, effectively overcoming these limitations. This advancement unlocks the construction of architectures that were previously considered impractical. We demonstrate through our experiments that our method produces expressive models that become increasingly efficient as they scale. To foster further advancement, we provide an open-source library implementing this method, available at https://github.com/thib-s/orthogonium.</description>

      <title>Scalable Oversight for Superhuman AI via Recursive Self-Critiquing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As AI capabilities increasingly surpass human proficiency in complex tasks, current alignment techniques including SFT and RLHF face fundamental challenges in ensuring reliable oversight. These methods rely on direct human assessment and become untenable when AI outputs exceed human cognitive thresholds. In response to this challenge, we explore two hypotheses: (1) critique of critique can be easier than critique itself, extending the widely-accepted observation that verification is easier than generation to the critique domain, as critique itself is a specialized form of generation; (2) this difficulty relationship is recursively held, suggesting that when direct evaluation is infeasible, performing high-order critiques (e.g., critique of critique of critique) offers a more tractable supervision pathway. To examine these hypotheses, we perform Human-Human, Human-AI, and AI-AI experiments across multiple tasks. Our results demonstrate encouraging evidence supporting these hypotheses and suggest that recursive self-critiquing is a promising direction for scalable oversight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced text generation capabilities, yet evaluating their performance in generative writing remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on generic text generation or limited in writing tasks, failing to capture the diverse requirements of high-quality written contents across various domains. To bridge this gap, we present WritingBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs across 6 core writing domains and 100 subdomains, encompassing creative, persuasive, informative, and technical writing. We further propose a query-dependent evaluation framework that empowers LLMs to dynamically generate instance-specific assessment criteria. This framework is complemented by a fine-tuned critic model for criteria-aware scoring, enabling evaluations in style, format and length. The framework's validity is further demonstrated by its data curation capability, which enables 7B-parameter models to approach state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We open-source the benchmark, along with evaluation tools and modular framework components, to advance the development of LLMs in writing.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Thought Reasoning In The Wild Is Not Always Faithful</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced state-of-the-art AI capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that CoT reasoning is not always faithful, i.e. CoT reasoning does not always reflect how models arrive at conclusions. So far, most of these studies have focused on unfaithfulness in unnatural contexts where an explicit bias has been introduced. In contrast, we show that unfaithful CoT can occur on realistic prompts with no artificial bias. Our results reveal non-negligible rates of several forms of unfaithful reasoning in frontier models: Sonnet 3.7 (16.3%), DeepSeek R1 (5.3%) and ChatGPT-4o (7.0%) all answer a notable proportion of question pairs unfaithfully. Specifically, we find that models rationalize their implicit biases in answers to binary questions ("implicit post-hoc rationalization"). For example, when separately presented with the questions "Is X bigger than Y?" and "Is Y bigger than X?", models sometimes produce superficially coherent arguments to justify answering Yes to both questions or No to both questions, despite such responses being logically contradictory. We also investigate restoration errors (Dziri et al., 2023), where models make and then silently correct errors in their reasoning, and unfaithful shortcuts, where models use clearly illogical reasoning to simplify solving problems in Putnam questions (a hard benchmark). Our findings raise challenges for AI safety work that relies on monitoring CoT to detect undesired behavior.</description>

      <title>Unimodal Distributions for Ordinal Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many real-world prediction tasks, class labels contain information about the relative order between labels that are not captured by commonly used loss functions such as multicategory cross-entropy. Recently, the preference for unimodal distributions in the output space has been incorporated into models and loss functions to account for such ordering information. However, current approaches rely on heuristics that lack a theoretical foundation. Here, we propose two new approaches to incorporate the preference for unimodal distributions into the predictive model. We analyse the set of unimodal distributions in the probability simplex and establish fundamental properties. We then propose a new architecture that imposes unimodal distributions and a new loss term that relies on the notion of projection in a set to promote unimodality. Experiments show the new architecture achieves top-2 performance, while the proposed new loss term is very competitive while maintaining high unimodality.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for the Offline Nanosatellite Task Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates how to schedule nanosatellite tasks more efficiently using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In the Offline Nanosatellite Task Scheduling (ONTS) problem, the goal is to find the optimal schedule for tasks to be carried out in orbit while taking into account Quality-of-Service (QoS) considerations such as priority, minimum and maximum activation events, execution time-frames, periods, and execution windows, as well as constraints on the satellite's power resources and the complexity of energy harvesting and management. The ONTS problem has been approached using conventional mathematical formulations and exact methods, but their applicability to challenging cases of the problem is limited. This study examines the use of GNNs in this context, which has been effectively applied to optimization problems such as the traveling salesman, scheduling, and facility placement problems. More specifically, we investigate whether GNNs can learn the complex structure of the ONTS problem with respect to feasibility and optimality of candidate solutions. Furthermore, we evaluate using GNN-based heuristic solutions to provide better solutions (w.r.t. the objective value) to the ONTS problem and reduce the optimization cost. Our experiments show that GNNs are not only able to learn feasibility and optimality for instances of the ONTS problem, but they can generalize to harder instances than those seen during training. Furthermore, the GNN-based heuristics improved the expected objective value of the best solution found under the time limit in 45%, and reduced the expected time to find a feasible solution in 35%, when compared to the SCIP (Solving Constraint Integer Programs) solver in its off-the-shelf configuration</description>

      <title>Why is AI not a Panacea for Data Workers? An Interview Study on Human-AI Collaboration in Data Storytelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data storytelling plays an important role in data workers' daily jobs since it boosts team collaboration and public communication. However, to make an appealing data story, data workers spend tremendous efforts on various tasks, including outlining and styling the story. Recently, a growing research trend has been exploring how to assist data storytelling with advanced artificial intelligence (AI). However, existing studies may focus on individual tasks in the workflow of data storytelling and do not reveal a complete picture of humans' preference for collaborating with AI. To better understand real-world needs, we interviewed eighteen data workers from both industry and academia to learn where and how they would like to collaborate with AI. Surprisingly, though the participants showed excitement about collaborating with AI, many of them also expressed reluctance and pointed out nuanced reasons. Based on their responses, we first characterize stages and tasks in the practical data storytelling workflows and the desired roles of AI. Then the preferred collaboration patterns in different tasks are identified. Next, we summarize the interviewees' reasons why and why not they would like to collaborate with AI. Finally, we provide suggestions for human-AI collaborative data storytelling to hopefully shed light on future related research.</description>

      <title>Human Choice Prediction in Language-based Persuasion Games: Simulation-based Off-Policy Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10361v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred interest in designing LLM-based agents for tasks that involve interaction with human and artificial agents. This paper addresses a key aspect in the design of such agents: predicting human decisions in off-policy evaluation (OPE). We focus on language-based persuasion games, where an expert aims to influence the decision-maker through verbal messages. In our OPE framework, the prediction model is trained on human interaction data collected from encounters with one set of expert agents, and its performance is evaluated on interactions with a different set of experts. Using a dedicated application, we collected a dataset of 87K decisions from humans playing a repeated decision-making game with artificial agents. To enhance off-policy performance, we propose a simulation technique involving interactions across the entire agent space and simulated decision-makers. Our learning strategy yields significant OPE gains, e.g., improving prediction accuracy in the top 15% challenging cases by 7.1%. Our code and the large dataset we collected and generated are submitted as supplementary material and publicly available in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/eilamshapira/HumanChoicePrediction</description>

      <title>BELLA: Black box model Explanations by Local Linear Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of black-box models has become not just a legal requirement, but also an additional way to assess their performance. However, the state of the art post-hoc explanation approaches for regression models rely on synthetic data generation, which introduces uncertainty and can hurt the reliability of the explanations. Furthermore, they tend to produce explanations that apply to only very few data points. In this paper, we present BELLA, a deterministic model-agnostic post-hoc approach for explaining the individual predictions of regression black-box models. BELLA provides explanations in the form of a linear model trained in the feature space. BELLA maximizes the size of the neighborhood to which the linear model applies so that the explanations are accurate, simple, general, and robust. BELLA can produce both factual and counterfactual explanations.</description>

      <title>Approximate Computing Survey, Part II: Application-Specific &amp; Architectural Approximation Techniques and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The challenging deployment of compute-intensive applications from domains such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Digital Signal Processing (DSP), forces the community of computing systems to explore new design approaches. Approximate Computing appears as an emerging solution, allowing to tune the quality of results in the design of a system in order to improve the energy efficiency and/or performance. This radical paradigm shift has attracted interest from both academia and industry, resulting in significant research on approximation techniques and methodologies at different design layers (from system down to integrated circuits). Motivated by the wide appeal of Approximate Computing over the last 10 years, we conduct a two-part survey to cover key aspects (e.g., terminology and applications) and review the state-of-the art approximation techniques from all layers of the traditional computing stack. Part II of the survey classifies and presents the technical details of application-specific and architectural approximation techniques, which both target the design of resource-efficient processors/accelerators and systems. Moreover, it reports a quantitative analysis of the techniques and a detailed analysis of the application spectrum of Approximate Computing, and finally, it discusses open challenges and future directions.</description>

      <title>Sample Efficient Preference Alignment in LLMs via Active Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference-based feedback is important for many applications in machine learning where evaluation of a reward function is not feasible. Notable recent examples arise in preference alignment for large language models, including in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO). For many applications of preference alignment, the cost of acquiring human feedback can be substantial. In this work, we take advantage of the fact that one can often choose contexts at which to obtain human feedback to most efficiently identify a good policy, and formalize the setting as an active contextual dueling bandit problem. We propose an active exploration algorithm to efficiently select the data and provide theoretical proof that it has a polynomial worst-case regret bound. We extend the setting and methodology for practical use in preference alignment of large language models. We provide two extensions, an online and an offline approach. Our method outperforms the baselines with limited samples of human preferences on several language models and four real-world datasets including two new datasets that we contribute to the literature.</description>

      <title>Image is All You Need to Empower Large-scale Diffusion Models for In-Domain Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-domain generation aims to perform a variety of tasks within a specific domain, such as unconditional generation, text-to-image, image editing, 3D generation, and more. Early research typically required training specialized generators for each unique task and domain, often relying on fully-labeled data. Motivated by the powerful generative capabilities and broad applications of diffusion models, we are driven to explore leveraging label-free data to empower these models for in-domain generation. Fine-tuning a pre-trained generative model on domain data is an intuitive but challenging way and often requires complex manual hyper-parameter adjustments since the limited diversity of the training data can easily disrupt the model's original generative capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose a guidance-decoupled prior preservation mechanism to achieve high generative quality and controllability by image-only data, inspired by preserving the pre-trained model from a denoising guidance perspective. We decouple domain-related guidance from the conditional guidance used in classifier-free guidance mechanisms to preserve open-world control guidance and unconditional guidance from the pre-trained model. We further propose an efficient domain knowledge learning technique to train an additional text-free UNet copy to predict domain guidance. Besides, we theoretically illustrate a multi-guidance in-domain generation pipeline for a variety of generative tasks, leveraging multiple guidances from distinct diffusion models and conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in domain-specific synthesis and its compatibility with various diffusion-based control methods and applications.</description>

      <title>SERL: A Software Suite for Sample-Efficient Robotic Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16013v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of robotic reinforcement learning (RL), enabling methods that handle complex image observations, train in the real world, and incorporate auxiliary data, such as demonstrations and prior experience. However, despite these advances, robotic RL remains hard to use. It is acknowledged among practitioners that the particular implementation details of these algorithms are often just as important (if not more so) for performance as the choice of algorithm. We posit that a significant challenge to widespread adoption of robotic RL, as well as further development of robotic RL methods, is the comparative inaccessibility of such methods. To address this challenge, we developed a carefully implemented library containing a sample efficient off-policy deep RL method, together with methods for computing rewards and resetting the environment, a high-quality controller for a widely-adopted robot, and a number of challenging example tasks. We provide this library as a resource for the community, describe its design choices, and present experimental results. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that our implementation can achieve very efficient learning, acquiring policies for PCB board assembly, cable routing, and object relocation between 25 to 50 minutes of training per policy on average, improving over state-of-the-art results reported for similar tasks in the literature. These policies achieve perfect or near-perfect success rates, extreme robustness even under perturbations, and exhibit emergent recovery and correction behaviors. We hope that these promising results and our high-quality open-source implementation will provide a tool for the robotics community to facilitate further developments in robotic RL.

      <title>CREMA: Generalizable and Efficient Video-Language Reasoning via Multimodal Modular Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05889v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite impressive advancements in recent multimodal reasoning approaches, they are still limited in flexibility and efficiency, as these models typically process only a few fixed modality inputs and require updates to numerous parameters. This paper tackles these critical challenges and proposes CREMA, a generalizable, highly efficient, and modular modality-fusion framework that can incorporate any new modality to enhance video reasoning. We first augment multiple informative modalities (such as optical flow, 3D point cloud, audio, thermal heatmap, and touch map) from given videos without extra human annotation by leveraging sensors or existing pre-trained models. Next, we introduce a query transformer with multiple parameter-efficient modules associated with each accessible modality. It projects diverse modality features to the LLM token embedding space, allowing the model to integrate different data types for response generation. Furthermore, we propose a novel progressive multimodal fusion design supported by a lightweight fusion module and modality-sequential training strategy. It helps compress information across various assisting modalities, maintaining computational efficiency in the LLM while improving performance. We validate our method on 7 video-language reasoning tasks assisted by diverse modalities, including conventional VideoQA and Video-Audio/3D/Touch/Thermal QA, and achieve better/equivalent performance against strong multimodal LLMs, including OneLLM, BLIP-2, and SeViLA while reducing over 90% trainable parameters. We provide extensive analyses of CREMA, including the impact of each modality on reasoning domains, the design of the fusion module, and example visualizations.</description>

      <title>Data Mixing Laws: Optimizing Data Mixtures by Predicting Language Modeling Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pretraining data of large language models composes multiple domains (e.g., web texts, academic papers, codes), whose mixture proportions crucially impact the competence of outcome models. While existing endeavors rely on heuristics or qualitative strategies to tune the proportions, we discover the quantitative predictability of model performance regarding the mixture proportions in function forms, which we refer to as the data mixing laws. Fitting such functions on sample mixtures unveils model performance on unseen mixtures before actual runs, thus guiding the selection of an ideal data mixture. Furthermore, we propose nested use of the scaling laws of training steps, model sizes, and our data mixing law to enable predicting the performance of large models trained on massive data under various mixtures with only small-scale training. Moreover, experimental results verify that our method effectively optimizes the training mixture of a 1B model trained for 100B tokens in RedPajama, reaching a performance comparable to the one trained for 48% more steps on the default mixture. Extending the application of data mixing laws to continual training accurately predicts the critical mixture proportion that avoids catastrophic forgetting and outlooks the potential for dynamic data schedules</description>

      <title>Paint by Inpaint: Learning to Add Image Objects by Removing Them First</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image editing has advanced significantly with the introduction of text-conditioned diffusion models. Despite this progress, seamlessly adding objects to images based on textual instructions without requiring user-provided input masks remains a challenge. We address this by leveraging the insight that removing objects (Inpaint) is significantly simpler than its inverse process of adding them (Paint), attributed to inpainting models that benefit from segmentation mask guidance. Capitalizing on this realization, by implementing an automated and extensive pipeline, we curate a filtered large-scale image dataset containing pairs of images and their corresponding object-removed versions. Using these pairs, we train a diffusion model to inverse the inpainting process, effectively adding objects into images. Unlike other editing datasets, ours features natural target images instead of synthetic ones while ensuring source-target consistency by construction. Additionally, we utilize a large Vision-Language Model to provide detailed descriptions of the removed objects and a Large Language Model to convert these descriptions into diverse, natural-language instructions. Our quantitative and qualitative results show that the trained model surpasses existing models in both object addition and general editing tasks.

      <title>LLM-SR: Scientific Equation Discovery via Programming with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical equations have been unreasonably effective in describing complex natural phenomena across various scientific disciplines. However, discovering such insightful equations from data presents significant challenges due to the necessity of navigating extremely large combinatorial hypothesis spaces. Current methods of equation discovery, commonly known as symbolic regression techniques, largely focus on extracting equations from data alone, often neglecting the domain-specific prior knowledge that scientists typically depend on. They also employ limited representations such as expression trees, constraining the search space and expressiveness of equations. To bridge this gap, we introduce LLM-SR, a novel approach that leverages the extensive scientific knowledge and robust code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to discover scientific equations from data. Specifically, LLM-SR treats equations as programs with mathematical operators and combines LLMs' scientific priors with evolutionary search over equation programs. The LLM iteratively proposes new equation skeleton hypotheses, drawing from its domain knowledge, which are then optimized against data to estimate parameters. We evaluate LLM-SR on four benchmark problems across diverse scientific domains (e.g., physics, biology), which we carefully designed to simulate the discovery process and prevent LLM recitation. Our results demonstrate that LLM-SR discovers physically accurate equations that significantly outperform state-of-the-art symbolic regression baselines, particularly in out-of-domain test settings. We also show that LLM-SR's incorporation of scientific priors enables more efficient equation space exploration than the baselines.

      <title>DirectMultiStep: Direct Route Generation for Multistep Retrosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) methods rely on iterative single-step predictions, leading to exponential search space growth that limits efficiency and scalability. We introduce a series of transformer-based models, that leverage a mixture of experts approach to directly generate multistep synthetic routes as a single string, conditionally predicting each transformation based on all preceding ones. Our DMS Explorer XL model, which requires only target compounds as input, outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the PaRoutes dataset with 1.9x and 3.1x improvements in Top-1 accuracy on the n$_1$ and n$_5$ test sets, respectively. Providing additional information, such as the desired number of steps and starting materials, enables both a reduction in model size and an increase in accuracy, highlighting the benefits of incorporating more constraints into the prediction process. The top-performing DMS-Flex (Duo) model scores 25-50% higher on Top-1 and Top-10 accuracies for both n$_1$ and n$_5$ sets. Additionally, our models successfully predict routes for FDA-approved drugs not included in the training data, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. While the limited diversity of the training set may affect performance on less common reaction types, our multistep-first approach presents a promising direction towards fully automated retrosynthetic planning.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised Concept Bottleneck Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have garnered increasing attention due to their ability to provide concept-based explanations for black-box deep learning models while achieving high final prediction accuracy using human-like concepts. However, the training of current CBMs is heavily dependent on the precision and richness of the annotated concepts in the dataset. These concept labels are typically provided by experts, which can be costly and require significant resources and effort. Additionally, concept saliency maps frequently misalign with input saliency maps, causing concept predictions to correspond to irrelevant input features - an issue related to annotation alignment. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework called SSCBM (Semi-supervised Concept Bottleneck Model). Our SSCBM is suitable for practical situations where annotated data is scarce. By leveraging joint training on both labeled and unlabeled data and aligning the unlabeled data at the concept level, we effectively solve these issues. We proposed a strategy to generate pseudo labels and an alignment loss. Experiments demonstrate that our SSCBM is both effective and efficient. With only 10% labeled data, our model's concept and task accuracy on average across four datasets is only 2.44% and 3.93% lower, respectively, compared to the best baseline in the fully supervised learning setting.</description>

      <title>Model-based learning for multi-antenna multi-frequency location-to-channel mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Years of study of the propagation channel showed a close relation between a location and the associated communication channel response. The use of a neural network to learn the location-to-channel mapping can therefore be envisioned. The Implicit Neural Representation (INR) literature showed that classical neural architecture are biased towards learning low-frequency content, making the location-to-channel mapping learning a non-trivial problem. Indeed, it is well known that this mapping is a function rapidly varying with the location, on the order of the wavelength. This paper leverages the model-based machine learning paradigm to derive a problem-specific neural architecture from a propagation channel model. The resulting architecture efficiently overcomes the spectral-bias issue. It only learns low-frequency sparse correction terms activating a dictionary of high-frequency components. The proposed architecture is evaluated against classical INR architectures on realistic synthetic data, showing much better accuracy. Its mapping learning performance is explained based on the approximated channel model, highlighting the explainability of the model-based machine learning paradigm.</description>

      <title>I2AM: Interpreting Image-to-Image Latent Diffusion Models via Bi-Attribution Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale diffusion models have made significant advances in image generation, particularly through cross-attention mechanisms. While cross-attention has been well-studied in text-to-image tasks, their interpretability in image-to-image (I2I) diffusion models remains underexplored. This paper introduces Image-to-Image Attribution Maps (I2AM), a method that enhances the interpretability of I2I models by visualizing bidirectional attribution maps, from the reference image to the generated image and vice versa. I2AM aggregates cross-attention scores across time steps, attention heads, and layers, offering insights into how critical features are transferred between images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of I2AM across object detection, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks. Our results demonstrate that I2AM successfully identifies key regions responsible for generating the output, even in complex scenes. Additionally, we introduce the Inpainting Mask Attention Consistency Score (IMACS) as a novel evaluation metric to assess the alignment between attribution maps and inpainting masks, which correlates strongly with existing performance metrics. Through extensive experiments, we show that I2AM enables model debugging and refinement, providing practical tools for improving I2I model's performance and interpretability.</description>

      <title>LICORICE: Label-Efficient Concept-Based Interpretable Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have predominantly leveraged neural network policies for decision-making, yet these models often lack interpretability, posing challenges for stakeholder comprehension and trust. Concept bottleneck models offer an interpretable alternative by integrating human-understandable concepts into policies. However, prior work assumes that concept annotations are readily available during training. For RL, this requirement poses a significant limitation: it necessitates continuous real-time concept annotation, which either places an impractical burden on human annotators or incurs substantial costs in API queries and inference time when employing automated labeling methods. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel training scheme that enables RL agents to efficiently learn a concept-based policy by only querying annotators to label a small set of data. Our algorithm, LICORICE, involves three main contributions: interleaving concept learning and RL training, using an ensemble to actively select informative data points for labeling, and decorrelating the concept data. We show how LICORICE reduces human labeling efforts to 500 or fewer concept labels in three environments, and 5000 or fewer in two more complex environments, all at no cost to performance. We also explore the use of VLMs as automated concept annotators, finding them effective in some cases but imperfect in others. Our work significantly reduces the annotation burden for interpretable RL, making it more practical for real-world applications that necessitate transparency.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Driven Semantic Communication for Generative Models with Bandwidth Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been extensively utilized in AI-generated content (AIGC) in recent years, thanks to the superior generation capabilities. Combining with semantic communications, diffusion models are used for tasks such as denoising, data reconstruction, and content generation. However, existing diffusion-based generative models do not consider the stringent bandwidth limitation, which limits its application in wireless communication. This paper introduces a diffusion-driven semantic communication framework with advanced VAE-based compression for bandwidth-constrained generative model. Our designed architecture utilizes the diffusion model, where the signal transmission process through the wireless channel acts as the forward process in diffusion. To reduce bandwidth requirements, we incorporate a downsampling module and a paired upsampling module based on a variational auto-encoder with reparameterization at the receiver to ensure that the recovered features conform to the Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, we derive the loss function for our proposed system and evaluate its performance through comprehensive experiments. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in pixel-level metrics such as peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and semantic metrics like learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). These enhancements are more profound regarding the compression rates and SNR compared to deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC).</description>

      <title>Mobile Edge Intelligence for Large Language Models: A Contemporary Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-device large language models (LLMs), referring to running LLMs on edge devices, have raised considerable interest since they are more cost-effective, latency-efficient, and privacy-preserving compared with the cloud paradigm. Nonetheless, the performance of on-device LLMs is intrinsically constrained by resource limitations on edge devices. Sitting between cloud and on-device AI, mobile edge intelligence (MEI) presents a viable solution by provisioning AI capabilities at the edge of mobile networks, enabling end users to offload heavy AI computation to capable edge servers nearby. This article provides a contemporary survey on harnessing MEI for LLMs. We begin by illustrating several killer applications to demonstrate the urgent need for deploying LLMs at the network edge. Next, we present the preliminaries of LLMs and MEI, followed by resource-efficient LLM techniques. We then present an architectural overview of MEI for LLMs (MEI4LLM), outlining its core components and how it supports the deployment of LLMs. Subsequently, we delve into various aspects of MEI4LLM, extensively covering edge LLM caching and delivery, edge LLM training, and edge LLM inference. Finally, we identify future research opportunities. We hope this article inspires researchers in the field to leverage mobile edge computing to facilitate LLM deployment, thereby unleashing the potential of LLMs across various privacy- and delay-sensitive applications.</description>

      <title>EPAM-Net: An Efficient Pose-driven Attention-guided Multimodal Network for Video Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing multimodal-based human action recognition approaches are computationally intensive, limiting their deployment in real-time applications. In this work, we present a novel and efficient pose-driven attention-guided multimodal network (EPAM-Net) for action recognition in videos. Specifically, we propose eXpand temporal Shift (X-ShiftNet) convolutional architectures for RGB and pose streams to capture spatio-temporal features from RGB videos and their skeleton sequences. The X-ShiftNet tackles the high computational cost of the 3D CNNs by integrating the Temporal Shift Module (TSM) into an efficient 2D CNN, enabling efficient spatiotemporal learning. Then skeleton features are utilized to guide the visual network stream, focusing on keyframes and their salient spatial regions using the proposed spatial-temporal attention block. Finally, the predictions of the two streams are fused for final classification. The experimental results show that our method, with a significant reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs), outperforms and competes with the state-of-the-art methods on NTU RGB-D 60, NTU RGB-D 120, PKU-MMD, and Toyota SmartHome datasets. The proposed EPAM-Net provides up to a 72.8x reduction in FLOPs and up to a 48.6x reduction in the number of network parameters. The code will be available at https://github.com/ahmed-nady/Multimodal-Action-Recognition.</description>

      <title>Development of a graph neural network surrogate for travel demand modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As urban environments grow, the modelling of transportation systems becomes increasingly complex. This paper advances the field of travel demand modelling by introducing advanced Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures as surrogate models, addressing key limitations of previous approaches. Building on prior work with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), we introduce GATv3, a new Graph Attention Network (GAT) variant that mitigates over-smoothing through residual connections, enabling deeper and more expressive architectures. Additionally, we propose a fine-grained classification framework that improves predictive stability while achieving numerical precision comparable to regression, offering a more interpretable and efficient alternative. To enhance model performance, we develop a synthetic data generation strategy, which expands the augmented training dataset without overfitting. Our experiments demonstrate that GATv3 significantly improves classification performance, while the GCN model shows unexpected dominance in fine-grained classification when supplemented with additional training data. The results highlight the advantages of fine-grained classification over regression for travel demand modelling tasks and reveal new challenges in extending GAT-based architectures to complex transport scenarios. Notably, GATv3 appears well-suited for classification-based transportation applications, such as section control and congestion warning systems, which require a higher degree of differentiation among neighboring links. These findings contribute to refining GNN-based surrogates, offering new possibilities for applying GATv3 and fine-grained classification in broader transportation challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-Free Class Incremental Learning (DFCIL) aims to enable models to continuously learn new classes while retraining knowledge of old classes, even when the training data for old classes is unavailable. Although explored primarily with image datasets by researchers, this study focuses on investigating DFCIL for skeleton-based gesture classification due to its significant real-world implications, particularly considering the growing prevalence of VR/AR headsets where gestures serve as the primary means of control and interaction. In this work, we made an intriguing observation: skeleton models trained with base classes(even very limited) demonstrate strong generalization capabilities to unseen classes without requiring additional training. Building on this insight, we developed Synthetic Feature Replay (SFR) that can sample synthetic features from class prototypes to replay for old classes and augment for new classes (under a few-shot setting). Our proposed method showcases significant advancements over the state-of-the-art, achieving up to 15% enhancements in mean accuracy across all steps and largely mitigating the accuracy imbalance between base classes and new classes.</description>

      <title>Towards Adaptive Human-centric Video Anomaly Detection: A Comprehensive Framework and A New Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human-centric Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify human behaviors that deviate from normal. At its core, human-centric VAD faces substantial challenges, such as the complexity of diverse human behaviors, the rarity of anomalies, and ethical constraints. These challenges limit access to high-quality datasets and highlight the need for a dataset and framework supporting continual learning. Moving towards adaptive human-centric VAD, we introduce the HuVAD (Human-centric privacy-enhanced Video Anomaly Detection) dataset and a novel Unsupervised Continual Anomaly Learning (UCAL) framework. UCAL enables incremental learning, allowing models to adapt over time, bridging traditional training and real-world deployment. HuVAD prioritizes privacy by providing de-identified annotations and includes seven indoor/outdoor scenes, offering over 5x more pose-annotated frames than previous datasets. Our standard and continual benchmarks, utilize a comprehensive set of metrics, demonstrating that UCAL-enhanced models achieve superior performance in 82.14% of cases, setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). The dataset can be accessed at https://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/HuVAD.</description>

      <title>A Survey of the Self Supervised Learning Mechanisms for Vision Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17059v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep supervised learning models require high volume of labeled data to attain sufficiently good results. Although, the practice of gathering and annotating such big data is costly and laborious. Recently, the application of self supervised learning (SSL) in vision tasks has gained significant attention. The intuition behind SSL is to exploit the synchronous relationships within the data as a form of self-supervision, which can be versatile. In the current big data era, most of the data is unlabeled, and the success of SSL thus relies in finding ways to utilize this vast amount of unlabeled data available. Thus it is better for deep learning algorithms to reduce reliance on human supervision and instead focus on self-supervision based on the inherent relationships within the data. With the advent of ViTs, which have achieved remarkable results in computer vision, it is crucial to explore and understand the various SSL mechanisms employed for training these models specifically in scenarios where there is limited labelled data available. In this survey, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of systematically classifying the SSL techniques based upon their representations and pre-training tasks being applied. Additionally, we discuss the motivations behind SSL, review popular pre-training tasks, and highlight the challenges and advancements in this field. Furthermore, we present a comparative analysis of different SSL methods, evaluate their strengths and limitations, and identify potential avenues for future research.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The post-processing approaches are becoming prominent techniques to enhance machine learning models' fairness because of their intuitiveness, low computational cost, and excellent scalability. However, most existing post-processing methods are designed for task-specific fairness measures and are limited to single-output models. In this paper, we introduce a post-processing method for multi-output models, such as the ones used for multi-task/multi-class classification and representation learning, to enhance a model's distributional parity, a task-agnostic fairness measure. Existing methods for achieving distributional parity rely on the (inverse) cumulative density function of a model's output, restricting their applicability to single-output models. Extending previous works, we propose to employ optimal transport mappings to move a model's outputs across different groups towards their empirical Wasserstein barycenter. An approximation technique is applied to reduce the complexity of computing the exact barycenter and a kernel regression method is proposed to extend this process to out-of-sample data. Our empirical studies evaluate the proposed approach against various baselines on multi-task/multi-class classification and representation learning tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>GRE^2-MDCL: Graph Representation Embedding Enhanced via Multidimensional Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph representation learning has emerged as a powerful tool for preserving graph topology when mapping nodes to vector representations, enabling various downstream tasks such as node classification and community detection. However, most current graph neural network models face the challenge of requiring extensive labeled data, which limits their practical applicability in real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce. To address this challenge, researchers have explored Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), which leverages enhanced graph data and contrastive learning techniques. While promising, existing GCL methods often struggle with effectively capturing both local and global graph structures, and balancing the trade-off between nodelevel and graph-level representations. In this work, we propose Graph Representation Embedding Enhanced via Multidimensional Contrastive Learning (GRE2-MDCL). Our model introduces a novel triple network architecture with a multi-head attention GNN as the core. GRE2-MDCL first globally and locally augments the input graph using SVD and LAGNN techniques. It then constructs a multidimensional contrastive loss, incorporating cross-network, cross-view, and neighbor contrast, to optimize the model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed demonstrate that GRE2-MDCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 82.5%, 72.5%, and 81.6% respectively. Visualizations further show tighter intra-cluster aggregation and clearer inter-cluster boundaries, highlighting the effectiveness of our framework in improving upon baseline GCL models.</description>

      <title>Robust Federated Learning Over the Air: Combating Heavy-Tailed Noise with Median Anchored Clipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15100v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging over-the-air computations for model aggregation is an effective approach to cope with the communication bottleneck in federated edge learning. By exploiting the superposition properties of multi-access channels, this approach facilitates an integrated design of communication and computation, thereby enhancing system privacy while reducing implementation costs. However, the inherent electromagnetic interference in radio channels often exhibits heavy-tailed distributions, giving rise to exceptionally strong noise in globally aggregated gradients that can significantly deteriorate the training performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel gradient clipping method, termed Median Anchored Clipping (MAC), to combat the detrimental effects of heavy-tailed noise. We also derive analytical expressions for the convergence rate of model training with analog over-the-air federated learning under MAC, which quantitatively demonstrates the effect of MAC on training performance. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed MAC algorithm effectively mitigates the impact of heavy-tailed noise, hence substantially enhancing system robustness.</description>

      <title>GSplatLoc: Grounding Keypoint Descriptors into 3D Gaussian Splatting for Improved Visual Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although various visual localization approaches exist, such as scene coordinate regression and camera pose regression, these methods often struggle with optimization complexity or limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we explore the use of novel view synthesis techniques, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which enables the compact encoding of both 3D geometry and scene appearance. We propose a two-stage procedure that integrates dense and robust keypoint descriptors from the lightweight XFeat feature extractor into 3DGS, enhancing performance in both indoor and outdoor environments. The coarse pose estimates are directly obtained via 2D-3D correspondences between the 3DGS representation and query image descriptors. In the second stage, the initial pose estimate is refined by minimizing the rendering-based photometric warp loss. Benchmarking on widely used indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrates improvements over recent neural rendering-based localization methods, such as NeRFMatch and PNeRFLoc.</description>

      <title>SSTP: Efficient Sample Selection for Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a core task in autonomous driving. However, training advanced trajectory prediction models on large-scale datasets is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. In addition, the imbalanced distribution of driving scenarios often biases models toward data-rich cases, limiting performance in safety-critical, data-scarce conditions. To address these challenges, we propose the Sample Selection for Trajectory Prediction (SSTP) framework, which constructs a compact yet balanced dataset for trajectory prediction. SSTP consists of two main stages (1) Extraction, in which a pretrained trajectory prediction model computes gradient vectors for each sample to capture their influence on parameter updates; and (2) Selection, where a submodular function is applied to greedily choose a representative subset that covers diverse driving scenarios. This approach significantly reduces the dataset size and mitigates scenario imbalance, without sacrificing prediction accuracy and even improving in high-density cases. We evaluate our proposed SSTP on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 benchmarks using a wide range of recent state-of-the-art models. Our experiments demonstrate that SSTP achieves comparable performance to full-dataset training using only half the data while delivering substantial improvements in high-density traffic scenes and significantly reducing training time. Importantly, SSTP exhibits strong generalization and robustness, and the selected subset is model-agnostic, offering a broadly applicable solution.</description>

      <title>Undesirable Memorization in Large Language Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While recent research increasingly showcases the remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is equally crucial to examine their associated risks. Among these, privacy and security vulnerabilities are particularly concerning, posing significant ethical and legal challenges. At the heart of these vulnerabilities stands memorization, which refers to a model's tendency to store and reproduce phrases from its training data. This phenomenon has been shown to be a fundamental source to various privacy and security attacks against LLMs. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of the literature on LLM memorization, exploring it across three dimensions: granularity, retrievability, and desirability. Next, we discuss the metrics and methods used to quantify memorization, followed by an analysis of the causes and factors that contribute to memorization phenomenon. We then explore strategies that are used so far to mitigate the undesirable aspects of this phenomenon. We conclude our survey by identifying potential research topics for the near future, including methods to balance privacy and performance, and the analysis of memorization in specific LLM contexts such as conversational agents, retrieval-augmented generation, and diffusion language models. Given the rapid research pace in this field, we also maintain a dedicated repository of the references discussed in this survey which will be regularly updated to reflect the latest developments.</description>

      <title>SPINE: Online Semantic Planning for Missions with Incomplete Natural Language Specifications in Unstructured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As robots become increasingly capable, users will want to describe high-level missions and have robots infer the relevant details. because pre-built maps are difficult to obtain in many realistic settings, accomplishing such missions will require the robot to map and plan online. while many semantic planning methods operate online, they are typically designed for well specified missions such as object search or exploration. recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful contextual reasoning abilities over a range of robotic tasks described in natural language. however, existing LLM-enabled planners typically do not consider online planning or complex missions; rather, relevant subtasks and semantics are provided by a pre-built map or a user. we address these limitations via spine, an online planner for missions with incomplete mission specifications provided in natural language. the planner uses an LLM to reason about subtasks implied by the mission specification and then realizes these subtasks in a receding horizon framework. tasks are automatically validated for safety and refined online with new map observations. we evaluate spine in simulation and real-world settings with missions that require multiple steps of semantic reasoning and exploration in cluttered outdoor environments of over 20,000m$^2$. compared to baselines that use existing LLM-enabled planning approaches, our method is over twice as efficient in terms of time and distance, requires less user interactions, and does not require a full map.

      <title>Pareto Control Barrier Function for Inner Safe Set Maximization Under Input Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces the Pareto Control Barrier Function (PCBF) algorithm to maximize the inner safe set of dynamical systems under input constraints. Traditional Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) ensure safety by maintaining system trajectories within a safe set but often fail to account for realistic input constraints. To address this problem, we leverage the Pareto multi-task learning framework to balance competing objectives of safety and safe set volume. The PCBF algorithm is applicable to high-dimensional systems and is computationally efficient. We validate its effectiveness through comparison with Hamilton-Jacobi reachability for an inverted pendulum and through simulations on a 12-dimensional quadrotor system. Results show that the PCBF consistently outperforms existing methods, yielding larger safe sets and ensuring safety under input constraints.</description>

      <title>Automatic Curriculum Expert Iteration for Reliable LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hallucinations (i.e., generating plausible but inaccurate content) and laziness (i.e. excessive refusals or defaulting to "I don't know") persist as major challenges in LLM reasoning. Current efforts to reduce hallucinations primarily focus on factual errors in knowledge-grounded tasks, often neglecting hallucinations related to faulty reasoning. Meanwhile, some approaches render LLMs overly conservative, limiting their problem-solving capabilities. To mitigate hallucination and laziness in reasoning tasks, we propose Automatic Curriculum Expert Iteration (Auto-CEI) to enhance LLM reasoning and align responses to the model's capabilities--assertively answering within its limits and declining when tasks exceed them. In our method, Expert Iteration explores the reasoning trajectories near the LLM policy, guiding incorrect paths back on track to reduce compounding errors and improve robustness; it also promotes appropriate "I don't know" responses after sufficient reasoning attempts. The curriculum automatically adjusts rewards, incentivizing extended reasoning before acknowledging incapability, thereby pushing the limits of LLM reasoning and aligning its behaviour with these limits. We compare Auto-CEI with various SOTA baselines across logical reasoning, mathematics, and planning tasks, where Auto-CEI achieves superior alignment by effectively balancing assertiveness and conservativeness.

      <title>MRAG-Bench: Vision-Centric Evaluation for Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing multimodal retrieval benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether models can retrieve and utilize external textual knowledge for question answering. However, there are scenarios where retrieving visual information is either more beneficial or easier to access than textual data. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation benchmark, MRAG-Bench, in which we systematically identify and categorize scenarios where visually augmented knowledge is better than textual knowledge, for instance, more images from varying viewpoints. MRAG-Bench consists of 16,130 images and 1,353 human-annotated multiple-choice questions across 9 distinct scenarios. With MRAG-Bench, we conduct an evaluation of 10 open-source and 4 proprietary large vision-language models (LVLMs). Our results show that all LVLMs exhibit greater improvements when augmented with images compared to textual knowledge, confirming that MRAG-Bench is vision-centric. Additionally, we conduct extensive analysis with MRAG-Bench, which offers valuable insights into retrieval-augmented LVLMs. Notably, the top-performing model, GPT-4o, faces challenges in effectively leveraging retrieved knowledge, achieving only a 5.82% improvement with ground-truth information, in contrast to a 33.16% improvement observed in human participants. These findings highlight the importance of MRAG-Bench in encouraging the community to enhance LVLMs' ability to utilize retrieved visual knowledge more effectively.</description>

      <title>Preserve or Modify? Context-Aware Evaluation for Balancing Preservation and Modification in Text-Guided Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of vision-language and generative models has significantly advanced text-guided image editing, which seeks the preservation of core elements in the source image while implementing modifications based on the target text. However, existing metrics have a context-blindness problem, indiscriminately applying the same evaluation criteria on completely different pairs of source image and target text, biasing towards either modification or preservation. Directional CLIP similarity, the only metric that considers both source image and target text, is also biased towards modification aspects and attends to irrelevant editing regions of the image. We propose AugCLIP, a context-aware metric that adaptively coordinates preservation and modification aspects, depending on the specific context of a given source image and target text. This is done by deriving the CLIP representation of an ideally edited image, that preserves the source image with necessary modifications to align with target text. More specifically, using a multi-modal large language model, AugCLIP augments the textual descriptions of the source and target, then calculates a modification vector through a hyperplane that separates source and target attributes in CLIP space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, encompassing a diverse range of editing scenarios, show that AugCLIP aligns remarkably well with human evaluation standards, outperforming existing metrics.

      <description>arXiv:2410.13924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural network performance scales with both model size and data volume, as shown in both language and image processing. This requires scaling-friendly architectures and large datasets. While transformers have been adapted for 3D vision, a `GPT-moment' remains elusive due to limited training data. We introduce ARKit LabelMaker, a large-scale real-world 3D dataset with dense semantic annotation that is more than three times larger than prior largest dataset. Specifically, we extend ARKitScenes with automatically generated dense 3D labels using an extended LabelMaker pipeline, tailored for large-scale pre-training. Training on our dataset improves accuracy across architectures, achieving state-of-the-art 3D semantic segmentation scores on ScanNet and ScanNet200, with notable gains on tail classes. Our code is available at https://labelmaker.org and our dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/labelmaker/arkit_labelmaker.</description>

      <title>From Isolated Conversations to Hierarchical Schemas: Dynamic Tree Memory Representation for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have significantly improved their context windows, yet challenges in effective long-term memory management remain. We introduce MemTree, an algorithm that leverages a dynamic, tree-structured memory representation to optimize the organization, retrieval, and integration of information, akin to human cognitive schemas. MemTree organizes memory hierarchically, with each node encapsulating aggregated textual content, corresponding semantic embeddings, and varying abstraction levels across the tree's depths. Our algorithm dynamically adapts this memory structure by computing and comparing semantic embeddings of new and existing information to enrich the model's context-awareness. This approach allows MemTree to handle complex reasoning and extended interactions more effectively than traditional memory augmentation methods, which often rely on flat lookup tables. Evaluations on benchmarks for multi-turn dialogue understanding and document question answering show that MemTree significantly enhances performance in scenarios that demand structured memory management.</description>

      <title>ROCKET-1: Mastering Open-World Interaction with Visual-Temporal Context Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have excelled in multimodal tasks, but adapting them to embodied decision-making in open-world environments presents challenges. One critical issue is bridging the gap between discrete entities in low-level observations and the abstract concepts required for effective planning. A common solution is building hierarchical agents, where VLMs serve as high-level reasoners that break down tasks into executable sub-tasks, typically specified using language. However, language suffers from the inability to communicate detailed spatial information. We propose visual-temporal context prompting, a novel communication protocol between VLMs and policy models. This protocol leverages object segmentation from past observations to guide policy-environment interactions. Using this approach, we train ROCKET-1, a low-level policy that predicts actions based on concatenated visual observations and segmentation masks, supported by real-time object tracking from SAM-2. Our method unlocks the potential of VLMs, enabling them to tackle complex tasks that demand spatial reasoning. Experiments in Minecraft show that our approach enables agents to achieve previously unattainable tasks, with a $\mathbf{76}\%$ absolute improvement in open-world interaction performance. Codes and demos are now available on the project page: https://craftjarvis.github.io/ROCKET-1.</description>

Abstract: As diffusion models become increasingly popular, the misuse of copyrighted and private images has emerged as a major concern. One promising solution to mitigate this issue is identifying the contribution of specific training samples in generative models, a process known as data attribution. Existing data attribution methods for diffusion models typically quantify the contribution of a training sample by evaluating the change in diffusion loss when the sample is included or excluded from the training process. However, we argue that the direct usage of diffusion loss cannot represent such a contribution accurately due to the calculation of diffusion loss. Specifically, these approaches measure the divergence between predicted and ground truth distributions, which leads to an indirect comparison between the predicted distributions and cannot represent the variances between model behaviors. To address these issues, we aim to measure the direct comparison between predicted distributions with an attribution score to analyse the training sample importance, which is achieved by Diffusion Attribution Score (\textit{DAS}). Underpinned by rigorous theoretical analysis, we elucidate the effectiveness of DAS. Additionally, we explore strategies to accelerate DAS calculations, facilitating its application to large-scale diffusion models. Our extensive experiments across various datasets and diffusion models demonstrate that DAS significantly surpasses previous benchmarks in terms of the linear data-modelling score, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

      <title>LOCAL: Learning with Orientation Matrix to Infer Causal Structure from Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19464v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering the underlying Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from time series observational data is highly challenging due to the dynamic nature and complex nonlinear interactions between variables. Existing methods typically search for the optimal DAG by optimizing an objective function but face scalability challenges, as their computational demands grow exponentially with the dimensional expansion of variables. To this end, we propose LOCAL, a highly efficient, easy-to-implement, and constraint-free method for recovering dynamic causal structures. LOCAL is the first attempt to formulate a quasi-maximum likelihood-based score function for learning the dynamic DAG equivalent to the ground truth. Building on this, we introduce two adaptive modules that enhance the algebraic characterization of acyclicity: Asymptotic Causal Mask Learning (ACML) and Dynamic Graph Parameter Learning (DGPL). ACML constructs causal masks using learnable priority vectors and the Gumbel-Sigmoid function, ensuring DAG formation while optimizing computational efficiency. DGPL transforms causal learning into decomposed matrix products, capturing dynamic causal structure in high-dimensional data and improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that LOCAL significantly outperforms existing methods and highlight LOCAL's potential as a robust and efficient method for dynamic causal discovery.</description>

      <title>Precise and Dexterous Robotic Manipulation via Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for enabling autonomous acquisition of complex robotic manipulation skills, but realizing this potential in real-world settings has been challenging. We present a human-in-the-loop vision-based RL system that demonstrates impressive performance on a diverse set of dexterous manipulation tasks, including dynamic manipulation, precision assembly, and dual-arm coordination. Our approach integrates demonstrations and human corrections, efficient RL algorithms, and other system-level design choices to learn policies that achieve near-perfect success rates and fast cycle times within just 1 to 2.5 hours of training. We show that our method significantly outperforms imitation learning baselines and prior RL approaches, with an average 2x improvement in success rate and 1.8x faster execution. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we provide insights into the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating how it learns robust, adaptive policies for both reactive and predictive control strategies. Our results suggest that RL can indeed learn a wide range of complex vision-based manipulation policies directly in the real world within practical training times. We hope this work will inspire a new generation of learned robotic manipulation techniques, benefiting both industrial applications and research advancements.

      <title>A Deep Dive Into Large Language Model Code Generation Mistakes: What and Why?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their widespread application in automated code generation. However, these models can still generate defective code that deviates from the specification. Previous research has mainly focused on the mistakes in LLM-generated standalone functions, overlooking real-world software development situations where the successful generation of the code requires software contexts such as external dependencies. In this paper, we considered both of these code generation situations and identified a range of \textit{non-syntactic mistakes} arising from LLMs' misunderstandings of coding question specifications. Seven categories of non-syntactic mistakes were identified through extensive manual analyses, four of which were missed by previous works. To better understand these mistakes, we proposed six reasons behind these mistakes from various perspectives. Moreover, we explored the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting mistakes and their reasons. Our evaluation demonstrated that GPT-4 with the ReAct prompting technique can achieve an F1 score of up to 0.65 when identifying reasons for LLM's mistakes, such as misleading function signatures. We believe that these findings offer valuable insights into enhancing the quality of LLM-generated code.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Composition Activations: Unleashing the Dynamics of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers have found extensive applications across various domains due to the powerful fitting capabilities. This success can be partially attributed to their inherent nonlinearity. Thus, in addition to the ReLU function employed in the original transformer architecture, researchers have explored alternative modules such as GeLU and SwishGLU to enhance nonlinearity and thereby augment representational capacity. In this paper, we propose a novel category of polynomial composition activations (PolyCom), designed to optimize the dynamics of transformers. Theoretically, we provide a comprehensive mathematical analysis of PolyCom, highlighting its enhanced expressivity and efficacy relative to other activation functions. Notably, we demonstrate that networks incorporating PolyCom achieve the $\textbf{optimal approximation rate}$, indicating that PolyCom networks require minimal parameters to approximate general smooth functions in Sobolev spaces. We conduct empirical experiments on the pre-training configurations of large language models (LLMs), including both dense and sparse architectures. By substituting conventional activation functions with PolyCom, we enable LLMs to capture higher-order interactions within the data, thus improving performance metrics in terms of accuracy and convergence rates. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing substantial improvements over other activation functions.

      <title>Repurposing Stable Diffusion Attention for Training-Free Unsupervised Interactive Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in interactive point prompt based Image Segmentation allows to significantly reduce the manual effort to obtain high quality semantic labels. State-of-the-art unsupervised methods use self-supervised pre-trained models to obtain pseudo-labels which are used in training a prompt-based segmentation model. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised and training-free approach based solely on the self-attention of Stable Diffusion. We interpret the self-attention tensor as a Markov transition operator, which enables us to iteratively construct a Markov chain. Pixel-wise counting of the required number of iterations along the Markov chain to reach a relative probability threshold yields a Markov-iteration-map, which we simply call a Markov-map. Compared to the raw attention maps, we show that our proposed Markov-map has less noise, sharper semantic boundaries and more uniform values within semantically similar regions. We integrate the Markov-map in a simple yet effective truncated nearest neighbor framework to obtain interactive point prompt based segmentation. Despite being training-free, we experimentally show that our approach yields excellent results in terms of Number of Clicks (NoC), even outperforming state-of-the-art training based unsupervised methods in most of the datasets.

      <title>ViBe: A Text-to-Video Benchmark for Evaluating Hallucination in Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have expanded their capabilities to video understanding, with Text-to-Video (T2V) models excelling in generating videos from textual prompts. However, they still frequently produce hallucinated content, revealing AI-generated inconsistencies. We introduce ViBe (https://vibe-t2v-bench.github.io/): a large-scale dataset of hallucinated videos from open-source T2V models. We identify five major hallucination types: Vanishing Subject, Omission Error, Numeric Variability, Subject Dysmorphia, and Visual Incongruity. Using ten T2V models, we generated and manually annotated 3,782 videos from 837 diverse MS COCO captions. Our proposed benchmark includes a dataset of hallucinated videos and a classification framework using video embeddings. ViBe serves as a critical resource for evaluating T2V reliability and advancing hallucination detection. We establish classification as a baseline, with the TimeSFormer + CNN ensemble achieving the best performance (0.345 accuracy, 0.342 F1 score). While initial baselines proposed achieve modest accuracy, this highlights the difficulty of automated hallucination detection and the need for improved methods. Our research aims to drive the development of more robust T2V models and evaluate their outputs based on user preferences.</description>

      <title>FOCUS: Knowledge-enhanced Adaptive Visual Compression for Few-shot Whole Slide Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Few-shot learning presents a critical solution for cancer diagnosis in computational pathology (CPath), addressing fundamental limitations in data availability, particularly the scarcity of expert annotations and patient privacy constraints. A key challenge in this paradigm stems from the inherent disparity between the limited training set of whole slide images (WSIs) and the enormous number of contained patches, where a significant portion of these patches lacks diagnostically relevant information, potentially diluting the model's ability to learn and focus on critical diagnostic features. While recent works attempt to address this by incorporating additional knowledge, several crucial gaps hinder further progress: (1) despite the emergence of powerful pathology foundation models (FMs), their potential remains largely untapped, with most approaches limiting their use to basic feature extraction; (2) current language guidance mechanisms attempt to align text prompts with vast numbers of WSI patches all at once, struggling to leverage rich pathological semantic information. To this end, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced adaptive visual compression framework, dubbed FOCUS, which uniquely combines pathology FMs with language prior knowledge to enable a focused analysis of diagnostically relevant regions by prioritizing discriminative WSI patches. Our approach implements a progressive three-stage compression strategy: we first leverage FMs for global visual redundancy elimination, and integrate compressed features with language prompts for semantic relevance assessment, then perform neighbor-aware visual token filtering while preserving spatial coherence. Extensive experiments on pathological datasets spanning breast, lung, and ovarian cancers demonstrate its superior performance in few-shot pathology diagnosis.

      <title>VideoRepair: Improving Text-to-Video Generation via Misalignment Evaluation and Localized Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generation capabilities across various domains. However, these models often generate videos that have misalignments with text prompts, especially when the prompts describe complex scenes with multiple objects and attributes. To address this, we introduce VideoRepair, a novel model-agnostic, training-free video refinement framework that automatically identifies fine-grained text-video misalignments and generates explicit spatial and textual feedback, enabling a T2V diffusion model to perform targeted, localized refinements. VideoRepair consists of two stages: In (1) video refinement planning, we first detect misalignments by generating fine-grained evaluation questions and answering them using an MLLM. Based on video evaluation outputs, we identify accurately generated objects and construct localized prompts to precisely refine misaligned regions. In (2) localized refinement, we enhance video alignment by 'repairing' the misaligned regions from the original video while preserving the correctly generated areas. This is achieved by frame-wise region decomposition using our Region-Preserving Segmentation (RPS) module. On two popular video generation benchmarks (EvalCrafter and T2V-CompBench), VideoRepair substantially outperforms recent baselines across various text-video alignment metrics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of VideoRepair components and qualitative examples.</description>

      <title>Physically Parameterized Differentiable MUSIC for DoA Estimation with Uncalibrated Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15144v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direction of arrival (DoA) estimation is a common sensing problem in radar, sonar, audio, and wireless communication systems. It has gained renewed importance with the advent of the integrated sensing and communication paradigm. To fully exploit the potential of such sensing systems, it is crucial to take into account potential hardware impairments that can negatively impact the obtained performance. This study introduces a joint DoA estimation and hardware impairment learning scheme following a model-based approach. Specifically, a differentiable version of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is derived, allowing efficient learning of the considered impairments. The proposed approach supports both supervised and unsupervised learning strategies, showcasing its practical potential. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method successfully learns significant inaccuracies in both antenna locations and complex gains. Additionally, the proposed method outperforms the classical MUSIC algorithm in the DoA estimation task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16730v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the application of large language models continues to expand in various fields, it poses higher challenges to the effectiveness of identifying harmful content generation and guardrail mechanisms. This research aims to evaluate the guardrail effectiveness of GPT-4o, Grok-2 Beta, Llama 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet through black-box testing of seemingly ethical multi-step jailbreak prompts. It conducts ethical attacks by designing an identical multi-step prompts that simulates the scenario of "corporate middle managers competing for promotions." The data results show that the guardrails of the above-mentioned LLMs were bypassed and the content of verbal attacks was generated. Claude 3.5 Sonnet's resistance to multi-step jailbreak prompts is more obvious. To ensure objectivity, the experimental process, black box test code, and enhanced guardrail code are uploaded to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/brucewang123456789/GeniusTrail.git.</description>

      <title>Pathways on the Image Manifold: Image Editing via Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16819v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in image editing, driven by image diffusion models, have shown remarkable progress. However, significant challenges remain, as these models often struggle to follow complex edit instructions accurately and frequently compromise fidelity by altering key elements of the original image. Simultaneously, video generation has made remarkable strides, with models that effectively function as consistent and continuous world simulators. In this paper, we propose merging these two fields by utilizing image-to-video models for image editing. We reformulate image editing as a temporal process, using pretrained video models to create smooth transitions from the original image to the desired edit. This approach traverses the image manifold continuously, ensuring consistent edits while preserving the original image's key aspects. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on text-based image editing, demonstrating significant improvements in both edit accuracy and image preservation.

      <title>Immune: Improving Safety Against Jailbreaks in Multi-modal LLMs via Inference-Time Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the widespread deployment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for visual-reasoning tasks, improving their safety has become crucial. Recent research indicates that despite training-time safety alignment, these models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In this work, we first highlight an important safety gap to describe that alignment achieved solely through safety training may be insufficient against jailbreak attacks. To address this vulnerability, we propose Immune, an inference-time defense framework that leverages a safe reward model through controlled decoding to defend against jailbreak attacks. Additionally, we provide a mathematical characterization of Immune, offering insights on why it improves safety against jailbreaks. Extensive evaluations on diverse jailbreak benchmarks using recent MLLMs reveal that Immune effectively enhances model safety while preserving the model's original capabilities. For instance, against text-based jailbreak attacks on LLaVA-1.6, Immune reduces the attack success rate by 57.82% and 16.78% compared to the base MLLM and state-of-the-art defense strategy, respectively.</description>

      <title>VideoGen-of-Thought: Step-by-step generating multi-shot video with minimal manual intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current video generation models excel at short clips but fail to produce cohesive multi-shot narratives due to disjointed visual dynamics and fractured storylines. Existing solutions either rely on extensive manual scripting/editing or prioritize single-shot fidelity over cross-scene continuity, limiting their practicality for movie-like content. We introduce VideoGen-of-Thought (VGoT), a step-by-step framework that automates multi-shot video synthesis from a single sentence by systematically addressing three core challenges: (1) Narrative Fragmentation: Existing methods lack structured storytelling. We propose dynamic storyline modeling, which first converts the user prompt into concise shot descriptions, then elaborates them into detailed, cinematic specifications across five domains (character dynamics, background continuity, relationship evolution, camera movements, HDR lighting), ensuring logical narrative progression with self-validation. (2) Visual Inconsistency: Existing approaches struggle with maintaining visual consistency across shots. Our identity-aware cross-shot propagation generates identity-preserving portrait (IPP) tokens that maintain character fidelity while allowing trait variations (expressions, aging) dictated by the storyline. (3) Transition Artifacts: Abrupt shot changes disrupt immersion. Our adjacent latent transition mechanisms implement boundary-aware reset strategies that process adjacent shots' features at transition points, enabling seamless visual flow while preserving narrative continuity. VGoT generates multi-shot videos that outperform state-of-the-art baselines by 20.4% in within-shot face consistency and 17.4% in style consistency, while achieving over 100% better cross-shot consistency and 10x fewer manual adjustments than alternatives.</description>

      <title>Moto: Latent Motion Token as the Bridging Language for Learning Robot Manipulation from Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Models pre-trained on extensive corpora have shown significant success in various natural language processing tasks with minimal fine-tuning. This success offers new promise for robotics, which has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask: given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge available as a rich "corpus", can a similar generative pre-training approach be effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot manipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer, learning a bridging "language" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner. We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory rationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and efficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in transferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Can a MISL Fly? Analysis and Ingredients for Mutual Information Skill Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning has the potential of lifting several of the key challenges in reinforcement learning today, such as exploration, representation learning, and reward design. Recent work (METRA) has effectively argued that moving away from mutual information and instead optimizing a certain Wasserstein distance is important for good performance. In this paper, we argue that the benefits seen in that paper can largely be explained within the existing framework of mutual information skill learning (MISL). Our analysis suggests a new MISL method (contrastive successor features) that retains the excellent performance of METRA with fewer moving parts, and highlights connections between skill learning, contrastive representation learning, and successor features. Finally, through careful ablation studies, we provide further insight into some of the key ingredients for both our method and METRA.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning for Traffic Flow Prediction with Synthetic Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep-learning based traffic prediction models require vast amounts of data to learn embedded spatial and temporal dependencies. The inherent privacy and commercial sensitivity of such data has encouraged a shift towards decentralised data-driven methods, such as Federated Learning (FL). Under a traditional Machine Learning paradigm, traffic flow prediction models can capture spatial and temporal relationships within centralised data. In reality, traffic data is likely distributed across separate data silos owned by multiple stakeholders. In this work, a cross-silo FL setting is motivated to facilitate stakeholder collaboration for optimal traffic flow prediction applications. This work introduces an FL framework, referred to as FedTPS, to generate synthetic data to augment each client's local dataset by training a diffusion-based trajectory generation model through FL. The proposed framework is evaluated on a large-scale real world ride-sharing dataset using various FL methods and Traffic Flow Prediction models, including a novel prediction model we introduce, which leverages Temporal and Graph Attention mechanisms to learn the Spatio-Temporal dependencies embedded within regional traffic flow data. Experimental results show that FedTPS outperforms multiple other FL baselines with respect to global model performance.</description>

      <title>When Text Embedding Meets Large Language Model: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text embedding has become a foundational technology in natural language processing (NLP) during the deep learning era, driving advancements across a wide array of downstream tasks. While many natural language understanding challenges can now be modeled using generative paradigms and leverage the robust generative and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs), numerous practical applications - such as semantic matching, clustering, and information retrieval - continue to rely on text embeddings for their efficiency and effectiveness. Therefore, integrating LLMs with text embeddings has become a major research focus in recent years. In this survey, we categorize the interplay between LLMs and text embeddings into three overarching themes: (1) LLM-augmented text embedding, enhancing traditional embedding methods with LLMs; (2) LLMs as text embedders, adapting their innate capabilities for high-quality embedding; and (3) Text embedding understanding with LLMs, leveraging LLMs to analyze and interpret embeddings. By organizing recent works based on interaction patterns rather than specific downstream applications, we offer a novel and systematic overview of contributions from various research and application domains in the era of LLMs. Furthermore, we highlight the unresolved challenges that persisted in the pre-LLM era with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and explore the emerging obstacles brought forth by LLMs. Building on this analysis, we outline prospective directions for the evolution of text embedding, addressing both theoretical and practical opportunities in the rapidly advancing landscape of NLP.</description>

      <title>LazyDiT: Lazy Learning for the Acceleration of Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the preeminent models for a wide array of generative tasks, demonstrating superior performance and efficacy across various applications. The promising results come at the cost of slow inference, as each denoising step requires running the whole transformer model with a large amount of parameters. In this paper, we show that performing the full computation of the model at each diffusion step is unnecessary, as some computations can be skipped by lazily reusing the results of previous steps. Furthermore, we show that the lower bound of similarity between outputs at consecutive steps is notably high, and this similarity can be linearly approximated using the inputs. To verify our demonstrations, we propose the \textbf{LazyDiT}, a lazy learning framework that efficiently leverages cached results from earlier steps to skip redundant computations. Specifically, we incorporate lazy learning layers into the model, effectively trained to maximize laziness, enabling dynamic skipping of redundant computations. Experimental results show that LazyDiT outperforms the DDIM sampler across multiple diffusion transformer models at various resolutions. Furthermore, we implement our method on mobile devices, achieving better performance than DDIM with similar latency. Code: https://github.com/shawnricecake/lazydit</description>

      <title>Attributing Culture-Conditioned Generations to Pretraining Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In open-ended generative tasks like narrative writing or dialogue, large language models often exhibit cultural biases, showing limited knowledge and generating templated outputs for less prevalent cultures. Recent works show that these biases may stem from uneven cultural representation in pretraining corpora. This work investigates how pretraining leads to biased culture-conditioned generations by analyzing how models associate entities with cultures based on pretraining data patterns. We propose the MEMOed framework (MEMOrization from pretraining document) to determine whether a generation for a culture arises from memorization. Using MEMOed on culture-conditioned generations about food and clothing for 110 cultures, we find that high-frequency cultures in pretraining data yield more generations with memorized symbols, while some low-frequency cultures produce none. Additionally, the model favors generating entities with extraordinarily high frequency regardless of the conditioned culture, reflecting biases toward frequent pretraining terms irrespective of relevance. We hope that the MEMOed framework and our insights will inspire more works on attributing model performance on pretraining data.</description>

      <title>Is Long Context All You Need? Leveraging LLM's Extended Context for NL2SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12372v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks. In particular, improvements in reasoning abilities and the expansion of context windows have opened new avenues for leveraging these powerful models. NL2SQL is challenging in that the natural language question is inherently ambiguous, while the SQL generation requires a precise understanding of complex data schema and semantics. One approach to this semantic ambiguous problem is to provide more and sufficient contextual information.
  In this work, we explore the performance and the latency trade-offs of the extended context window (a.k.a., long context) offered by Google's state-of-the-art LLM (\textit{gemini-1.5-pro}). We study the impact of various contextual information, including column example values, question and SQL query pairs, user-provided hints, SQL documentation, and schema. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study how the extended context window and extra contextual information can help NL2SQL generation with respect to both accuracy and latency cost. We show that long context LLMs are robust and do not get lost in the extended contextual information. Additionally, our long-context NL2SQL pipeline based on Google's \textit{gemini-pro-1.5} achieve strong performances on various benchmark datasets without finetuning and expensive self-consistency based techniques.</description>

      <title>Fast3R: Towards 3D Reconstruction of 1000+ Images in One Forward Pass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction remains a core challenge in computer vision, particularly in applications requiring accurate and scalable representations across diverse perspectives. Current leading methods such as DUSt3R employ a fundamentally pairwise approach, processing images in pairs and necessitating costly global alignment procedures to reconstruct from multiple views. In this work, we propose Fast 3D Reconstruction (Fast3R), a novel multi-view generalization to DUSt3R that achieves efficient and scalable 3D reconstruction by processing many views in parallel. Fast3R's Transformer-based architecture forwards N images in a single forward pass, bypassing the need for iterative alignment. Through extensive experiments on camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction, Fast3R demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements in inference speed and reduced error accumulation. These results establish Fast3R as a robust alternative for multi-view applications, offering enhanced scalability without compromising reconstruction accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has led to marked progress in the field. One interesting direction for research is whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can be integrated with structured knowledge-based systems. This approach aims to combine the generative language understanding of LLMs and the precise knowledge representation systems by which they are integrated. This article surveys the relationship between LLMs and knowledge bases, looks at how they can be applied in practice, and discusses related technical, operational, and ethical challenges. Utilizing a comprehensive examination of the literature, the study both identifies important issues and assesses existing solutions. It demonstrates the merits of incorporating generative AI into structured knowledge-base systems concerning data contextualization, model accuracy, and utilization of knowledge resources. The findings give a full list of the current situation of research, point out the main gaps, and propose helpful paths to take. These insights contribute to advancing AI technologies and support their practical deployment across various sectors.</description>

      <title>Complexity in Complexity: Understanding Visual Complexity Through Structure, Color, and Surprise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how humans perceive visual complexity is a key area of study in visual cognition. Previous approaches to modeling visual complexity assessments have often resulted in intricate, difficult-to-interpret algorithms that employ numerous features or sophisticated deep learning architectures. While these complex models achieve high performance on specific datasets, they often sacrifice interpretability, making it challenging to understand the factors driving human perception of complexity. Recently (Shen, et al. 2024) proposed an interpretable segmentation-based model that accurately predicted complexity across various datasets, supporting the idea that complexity can be explained simply. In this work, we investigate the failure of their model to capture structural, color and surprisal contributions to complexity. To this end, we propose Multi-Scale Sobel Gradient (MSG) which measures spatial intensity variations, Multi-Scale Unique Color (MUC) which quantifies colorfulness across multiple scales, and surprise scores generated using a Large Language Model. We test our features on existing benchmarks and a novel dataset (Surprising Visual Genome) containing surprising images from Visual Genome. Our experiments demonstrate that modeling complexity accurately is not as simple as previously thought, requiring additional perceptual and semantic factors to address dataset biases. Our model improves predictive performance while maintaining interpretability, offering deeper insights into how visual complexity is perceived and assessed. Our code, analysis and data are available at https://github.com/Complexity-Project/Complexity-in-Complexity.</description>

      <title>Latent Action Learning Requires Supervision in the Presence of Distractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, latent action learning, pioneered by Latent Action Policies (LAPO), have shown remarkable pre-training efficiency on observation-only data, offering potential for leveraging vast amounts of video available on the web for embodied AI. However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</description>

      <title>A Retrospective Systematic Study on Hierarchical Sparse Query Transformer-assisted Ultrasound Screening for Early Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ranking as the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, demands urgent improvements in early detection to enhance patient survival. While ultrasound remains the preferred screening modality due to its cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities, its sensitivity (59%-78%) heavily relies on radiologists' expertise, leading to inconsistent diagnostic outcomes and operational inefficiencies. Recent advancements in AI technology offer promising solutions to bridge this gap. This study introduces the Hierarchical Sparse Query Transformer (HSQformer), a novel hybrid architecture that synergizes CNNs' local feature extraction with Vision Transformers' global contextual awareness through latent space representation and sparse learning. By dynamically activating task-specific experts via a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, HSQformer achieves hierarchical feature integration without structural redundancy. Evaluated across three clinical scenarios: single-center, multi-center, and high-risk patient cohorts, HSQformer outperforms state-of-the-art models (e.g., 95.38% AUC in multi-center testing) and matches senior radiologists' diagnostic accuracy while significantly surpassing junior counterparts. These results highlight the potential of AI-assisted tools to standardize HCC screening, reduce dependency on human expertise, and improve early diagnosis rates.

      <description>arXiv:2502.06759v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales to enhance text-to-SQL model fine-tuning. These rationales consist of intermediate SQL statements and explanations, serving as incremental steps toward constructing the final SQL query. The process begins with manually annotating a small set of examples, which are then used to prompt a large language model in an iterative, dynamic few-shot knowledge distillation procedure from a teacher model. A rationalization model is subsequently trained on the validated decomposed queries, enabling extensive synthetic CoT annotations for text-to-SQL datasets. To evaluate the approach, we fine-tune small language models with and without these rationales on the BIRD dataset. Results indicate that step-by-step query generation improves execution accuracy, especially for moderately and highly complex queries, while also enhancing explainability.</description>

      <title>From Image to Video: An Empirical Study of Diffusion Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized generative modeling, enabling unprecedented realism in image and video synthesis. This success has sparked interest in leveraging their representations for visual understanding tasks. While recent works have explored this potential for image generation, the visual understanding capabilities of video diffusion models remain largely uncharted. To address this gap, we systematically compare the same model architecture trained for video versus image generation, analyzing the performance of their latent representations on various downstream tasks including image classification, action recognition, depth estimation, and tracking. Results show that video diffusion models consistently outperform their image counterparts, though we find a striking range in the extent of this superiority. We further analyze features extracted from different layers and with varying noise levels, as well as the effect of model size and training budget on representation and generation quality. This work marks the first direct comparison of video and image diffusion objectives for visual understanding, offering insights into the role of temporal information in representation learning.</description>

      <title>ReLearn: Unlearning via Learning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current unlearning methods for large language models usually rely on reverse optimization to reduce target token probabilities. However, this paradigm disrupts the subsequent tokens prediction, degrading model performance and linguistic coherence. Moreover, existing evaluation metrics overemphasize contextual forgetting while inadequately assessing response fluency and relevance. To address these challenges, we propose ReLearn, a data augmentation and fine-tuning pipeline for effective unlearning, along with a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework introduces Knowledge Forgetting Rate (KFR) and Knowledge Retention Rate (KRR) to measure knowledge-level preservation, and Linguistic Score (LS) to evaluate generation quality. Our experiments show that ReLearn successfully achieves targeted forgetting while preserving high-quality output. Through mechanistic analysis, we further demonstrate how reverse optimization disrupts coherent text generation, while ReLearn preserves this essential capability.

      <title>Subjective Logic Encodings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many existing approaches for learning from labeled data assume the existence of gold-standard labels. According to these approaches, inter-annotator disagreement is seen as noise to be removed, either through refinement of annotation guidelines, label adjudication, or label filtering. However, annotator disagreement can rarely be totally eradicated, especially on more subjective tasks such as sentiment analysis or hate speech detection where disagreement is natural. Therefore, a new approach to learning from labeled data, called data perspectivism, seeks to leverage inter-annotator disagreement to learn models that stay true to the inherent uncertainty of the task by treating annotations as opinions of the annotators, rather than gold-standard facts. Despite this conceptual grounding, existing methods under data perspectivism are limited to using disagreement as the sole source of annotation uncertainty. To expand the possibilities of data perspectivism, we introduce Subjective Logic Encodings (SLEs), a flexible framework for constructing classification targets that explicitly encodes annotations as opinions of the annotators. Based on Subjective Logic Theory, SLEs encode labels as Dirichlet distributions and provide principled methods for encoding and aggregating various types of annotation uncertainty -- annotator confidence, reliability, and disagreement -- into the targets. We show that SLEs are a generalization of other types of label encodings as well as how to estimate models to predict SLEs using a distribution matching objective.</description>

      <title>LegalCore: A Dataset for Event Coreference Resolution in Legal Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12509v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recognizing events and their coreferential mentions in a document is essential for understanding semantic meanings of text. The existing research on event coreference resolution is mostly limited to news articles. In this paper, we present the first dataset for the legal domain, LegalCore, which has been annotated with comprehensive event and event coreference information. The legal contract documents we annotated in this dataset are several times longer than news articles, with an average length of around 25k tokens per document. The annotations show that legal documents have dense event mentions and feature both short-distance and super long-distance coreference links between event mentions. We further benchmark mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs) on this dataset for both event detection and event coreference resolution tasks, and find that this dataset poses significant challenges for state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, which perform significantly worse than a supervised baseline. We will publish the dataset as well as the code.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Scalability and Applicability of Kohn-Sham Hamiltonians for Molecular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a pivotal method within quantum chemistry and materials science, with its core involving the construction and solution of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. Despite its importance, the application of DFT is frequently limited by the substantial computational resources required to construct the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. In response to these limitations, current research has employed deep-learning models to efficiently predict molecular and solid Hamiltonians, with roto-translational symmetries encoded in their neural networks. However, the scalability of prior models may be problematic when applied to large molecules, resulting in non-physical predictions of ground-state properties. In this study, we generate a substantially larger training set (PubChemQH) than used previously and use it to create a scalable model for DFT calculations with physical accuracy. For our model, we introduce a loss function derived from physical principles, which we call Wavefunction Alignment Loss (WALoss). WALoss involves performing a basis change on the predicted Hamiltonian to align it with the observed one; thus, the resulting differences can serve as a surrogate for orbital energy differences, allowing models to make better predictions for molecular orbitals and total energies than previously possible. WALoss also substantially accelerates self-consistent-field (SCF) DFT calculations. Here, we show it achieves a reduction in total energy prediction error by a factor of 1347 and an SCF calculation speed-up by a factor of 18%. These substantial improvements set new benchmarks for achieving accurate and applicable predictions in larger molecular systems.</description>

      <title>No, of course I can! Refusal Mechanisms Can Be Exploited Using Harmless Fine-Tuning Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leading language model (LM) providers like OpenAI and Google offer fine-tuning APIs that allow customers to adapt LMs for specific use cases. To prevent misuse, these LM providers implement filtering mechanisms to block harmful fine-tuning data. Consequently, adversaries seeking to produce unsafe LMs via these APIs must craft adversarial training data that are not identifiably harmful. We make three contributions in this context: 1. We show that many existing attacks that use harmless data to create unsafe LMs rely on eliminating model refusals in the first few tokens of their responses. 2. We show that such prior attacks can be blocked by a simple defense that pre-fills the first few tokens from an aligned model before letting the fine-tuned model fill in the rest. 3. We describe a new data-poisoning attack, ``No, Of course I Can Execute'' (NOICE), which exploits an LM's formulaic refusal mechanism to elicit harmful responses. By training an LM to refuse benign requests on the basis of safety before fulfilling those requests regardless, we are able to jailbreak several open-source models and a closed-source model (GPT-4o). We show an attack success rate (ASR) of 57% against GPT-4o; our attack earned a Bug Bounty from OpenAI. Against open-source models protected by simple defenses, we improve ASRs by an average of 3.25 times compared to the best performing previous attacks that use only harmless data. NOICE demonstrates the exploitability of repetitive refusal mechanisms and broadens understanding of the threats closed-source models face from harmless data.</description>

      <title>SePer: Measure Retrieval Utility Through The Lens Of Semantic Perplexity Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01478v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved generation performance by incorporating externally retrieved knowledge, a process known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite the potential of this approach, existing studies evaluate RAG effectiveness by 1) assessing retrieval and generation components jointly, which obscures retrieval's distinct contribution, or 2) examining retrievers using traditional metrics such as NDCG, which creates a gap in understanding retrieval's true utility in the overall generation process. To address the above limitations, in this work, we introduce an automatic evaluation method that measures retrieval quality through the lens of information gain within the RAG framework. Specifically, we propose Semantic Perplexity (SePer), a metric that captures the LLM's internal belief about the correctness of the retrieved information. We quantify the utility of retrieval by the extent to which it reduces semantic perplexity post-retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SePer not only aligns closely with human preferences but also offers a more precise and efficient evaluation of retrieval utility across diverse RAG scenarios.</description>

      <title>TAET: Two-Stage Adversarial Equalization Training on Long-Tailed Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial robustness is a critical challenge in deploying deep neural networks for real-world applications. While adversarial training is a widely recognized defense strategy, most existing studies focus on balanced datasets, overlooking the prevalence of long-tailed distributions in real-world data, which significantly complicates robustness. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of adversarial training under long-tailed distributions and identifies limitations in the current state-of-the-art method, AT-BSL, in achieving robust performance under such conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel training framework, TAET, which integrates an initial stabilization phase followed by a stratified equalization adversarial training phase. Additionally, prior work on long-tailed robustness has largely ignored the crucial evaluation metric of balanced accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce the concept of balanced robustness, a comprehensive metric tailored for assessing robustness under long-tailed distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing advanced defenses, achieving significant improvements in both memory and computational efficiency. This work represents a substantial advancement in addressing robustness challenges in real-world applications. Our code is available at: https://github.com/BuhuiOK/TAET-Two-Stage-Adversarial-Equalization-Training-on-Long-Tailed-Distributions.</description>

      <title>KunlunBaize: LLM with Multi-Scale Convolution and Multi-Token Prediction Under TransformerX Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks, yet they face challenges such as low computational efficiency, gradient vanishing, and difficulties in capturing complex feature interactions. To address these limitations, a novel framework has been proposed. This framework incorporates a learnable dense residual skip connection mechanism, a TransformerX module a transformer based component integrating multiscale convolution and adaptive activation functions and a multitoken prediction interaction module. The learnable dense residual connections enhance information flow and feature capture across layers. Within the TransformerX module, large convolutional kernels aggregate semantic information from extensive text segments, while smaller convolutions focus on local word order and syntactic structures. The adaptive activation function dynamically adjusts its parameters based on the semantic features of the input text, improving the model's ability to handle diverse semantic expressions and complex relationships. The multitoken prediction module boosts data utilization and accelerates inference by predicting multiple future tokens. These components significantly enhance the performance and efficiency of large language models.</description>

      <title>SemHiTok: A Unified Image Tokenizer via Semantic-Guided Hierarchical Codebook for Multimodal Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06764v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SemHiTok, a unified image Tokenizer via Semantic-Guided Hierarchical codebook that provides consistent discrete feature representations for multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Recently, unified multimodal large models (MLLMs) for understanding and generation have sparked exploration within research community. Previous works attempt to train a unified image tokenizer by combining loss functions for semantic feature reconstruction and pixel reconstruction. However, due to the differing levels of features prioritized by multimodal understanding and generation tasks, joint training methods face significant challenges in achieving a good trade-off. SemHiTok addresses this challenge through Semantic-Guided Hierarchical codebook which builds texture sub-codebooks on pre-trained semantic codebook. This design decouples the training of semantic reconstruction and pixel reconstruction and equips the tokenizer with low-level texture feature extraction capability without degradation of high-level semantic feature extraction ability. Our experiments demonstrate that SemHiTok achieves excellent rFID score at 256X256resolution compared to other unified tokenizers, and exhibits competitive performance on multimodal understanding and generation tasks.</description>

      <title>MedAgentsBench: Benchmarking Thinking Models and Agent Frameworks for Complex Medical Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on existing medical question-answering benchmarks. This high performance makes it increasingly difficult to meaningfully evaluate and differentiate advanced methods. We present MedAgentsBench, a benchmark that focuses on challenging medical questions requiring multi-step clinical reasoning, diagnosis formulation, and treatment planning-scenarios where current models still struggle despite their strong performance on standard tests. Drawing from seven established medical datasets, our benchmark addresses three key limitations in existing evaluations: (1) the prevalence of straightforward questions where even base models achieve high performance, (2) inconsistent sampling and evaluation protocols across studies, and (3) lack of systematic analysis of the interplay between performance, cost, and inference time. Through experiments with various base models and reasoning methods, we demonstrate that the latest thinking models, DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o3, exhibit exceptional performance in complex medical reasoning tasks. Additionally, advanced search-based agent methods offer promising performance-to-cost ratios compared to traditional approaches. Our analysis reveals substantial performance gaps between model families on complex questions and identifies optimal model selections for different computational constraints. Our benchmark and evaluation framework are publicly available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/medagents-benchmark.</description>

      <title>CLIMB: Data Foundations for Large Scale Multimodal Clinical Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in clinical AI have enabled remarkable progress across many clinical domains. However, existing benchmarks and models are primarily limited to a small set of modalities and tasks, which hinders the development of large-scale multimodal methods that can make holistic assessments of patient health and well-being. To bridge this gap, we introduce Clinical Large-Scale Integrative Multimodal Benchmark (CLIMB), a comprehensive clinical benchmark unifying diverse clinical data across imaging, language, temporal, and graph modalities. CLIMB comprises 4.51 million patient samples totaling 19.01 terabytes distributed across 2D imaging, 3D video, time series, graphs, and multimodal data. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that multitask pretraining significantly improves performance on understudied domains, achieving up to 29% improvement in ultrasound and 23% in ECG analysis over single-task learning. Pretraining on CLIMB also effectively improves models' generalization capability to new tasks, and strong unimodal encoder performance translates well to multimodal performance when paired with task-appropriate fusion strategies. Our findings provide a foundation for new architecture designs and pretraining strategies to advance clinical AI research. Code is released at https://github.com/DDVD233/climb.</description>

      <title>Aligning Text to Image in Diffusion Models is Easier Than You Think</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While recent advancements in generative modeling have significantly improved text-image alignment, some residual misalignment between text and image representations still remains. Although many approaches have attempted to address this issue by fine-tuning models using various reward models, etc., we revisit the challenge from the perspective of representation alignment-an approach that has gained popularity with the success of REPresentation Alignment (REPA). We first argue that conventional text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, typically trained on paired image and text data (i.e., positive pairs) by minimizing score matching or flow matching losses, is suboptimal from the standpoint of representation alignment. Instead, a better alignment can be achieved through contrastive learning that leverages both positive and negative pairs. To achieve this efficiently even with pretrained models, we introduce a lightweight contrastive fine tuning strategy called SoftREPA that uses soft text tokens. This approach improves alignment with minimal computational overhead by adding fewer than 1M trainable parameters to the pretrained model. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method explicitly increases the mutual information between text and image representations, leading to enhanced semantic consistency. Experimental results across text-to-image generation and text-guided image editing tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the semantic consistency of T2I generative models.</description>

      <title>Mirror Descent and Novel Exponentiated Gradient Algorithms Using Trace-Form Entropies and Deformed Logarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose and investigate a wide class of Mirror Descent updates (MD) and associated novel Generalized Exponentiated Gradient (GEG) algorithms by exploiting various trace-form entropies and associated deformed logarithms and their inverses - deformed (generalized) exponential functions. The proposed algorithms can be considered as extension of entropic MD and generalization of multiplicative updates. In the literature, there exist nowadays over fifty mathematically well defined generalized entropies, so impossible to exploit all of them in one research paper. So we focus on a few selected most popular entropies and associated logarithms like the Tsallis, Kaniadakis and Sharma-Taneja-Mittal and some of their extension like Tempesta or Kaniadakis-Scarfone entropies. The shape and properties of the deformed logarithms and their inverses are tuned by one or more hyperparameters. By learning these hyperparameters, we can adapt to distribution of training data, which can be designed to the specific geometry of the optimization problem, leading to potentially faster convergence and better performance. The using generalized entropies and associated deformed logarithms in the Bregman divergence, used as a regularization term, provides some new insight into exponentiated gradient descent updates.</description>

Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in computational pathology (CPath), enabling scalable and generalizable analysis of histopathological images. While early developments centered on uni-modal models trained solely on visual data, recent advances have highlighted the promise of multi-modal foundation models that integrate heterogeneous data sources such as textual reports, structured domain knowledge, and molecular profiles. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of multi-modal foundation models in CPath, with a particular focus on models built upon hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained whole slide images (WSIs) and tile-level representations. We categorize 32 state-of-the-art multi-modal foundation models into three major paradigms: vision-language, vision-knowledge graph, and vision-gene expression. We further divide vision-language models into non-LLM-based and LLM-based approaches. Additionally, we analyze 28 available multi-modal datasets tailored for pathology, grouped into image-text pairs, instruction datasets, and image-other modality pairs. Our survey also presents a taxonomy of downstream tasks, highlights training and evaluation strategies, and identifies key challenges and future directions. We aim for this survey to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of pathology and AI.</description>

      <title>Search-R1: Training LLMs to Reason and Leverage Search Engines with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently acquiring external knowledge and up-to-date information is essential for effective reasoning and text generation in large language models (LLMs). Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities during inference to use search engines is not optimal, since the LLM does not learn how to optimally interact with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of the DeepSeek-R1 model where the LLM learns -- solely through reinforcement learning (RL) -- to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM rollouts with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 26% (Qwen2.5-7B), 21% (Qwen2.5-3B), and 10% (LLaMA3.2-3B) over strong baselines. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning.

      <title>Unifying 2D and 3D Vision-Language Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Progress in 3D vision-language learning has been hindered by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. We introduce UniVLG, a unified architecture for 2D and 3D vision-language understanding that bridges the gap between existing 2D-centric models and the rich 3D sensory data available in embodied systems. Our approach initializes most model weights from pre-trained 2D models and trains on both 2D and 3D vision-language data. We propose a novel language-conditioned mask decoder shared across 2D and 3D modalities to ground objects effectively in both RGB and RGB-D images, outperforming box-based approaches. To further reduce the domain gap between 2D and 3D, we incorporate 2D-to-3D lifting strategies, enabling UniVLG to utilize 2D data to enhance 3D performance. With these innovations, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple 3D vision-language grounding tasks, demonstrating the potential of transferring advances from 2D vision-language learning to the data-constrained 3D domain. Furthermore, co-training on both 2D and 3D data enhances performance across modalities without sacrificing 2D capabilities. By removing the reliance on 3D mesh reconstruction and ground-truth object proposals, UniVLG sets a new standard for realistic, embodied-aligned evaluation. Code and additional visualizations are available at https://univlg.github.io .</description>

      <title>Fourier Neural Operator based surrogates for $CO_2$ storage in realistic geologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study aims to develop surrogate models for accelerating decision making processes associated with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Selection of sub-surface $CO_2$ storage sites often necessitates expensive and involved simulations of $CO_2$ flow fields. Here, we develop a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) based model for real-time, high-resolution simulation of $CO_2$ plume migration. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset generated from realistic subsurface parameters and offers $O(10^5)$ computational acceleration with minimal sacrifice in prediction accuracy. We also explore super-resolution experiments to improve the computational cost of training the FNO based models. Additionally, we present various strategies for improving the reliability of predictions from the model, which is crucial while assessing actual geological sites. This novel framework, based on NVIDIA's Modulus library, will allow rapid screening of sites for CCS. The discussed workflows and strategies can be applied to other energy solutions like geothermal reservoir modeling and hydrogen storage. Our work scales scientific machine learning models to realistic 3D systems that are more consistent with real-life subsurface aquifers/reservoirs, paving the way for next-generation digital twins for subsurface CCS applications.</description>

      <title>Spherical Tree-Sliced Wasserstein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sliced Optimal Transport (OT) simplifies the OT problem in high-dimensional spaces by projecting supports of input measures onto one-dimensional lines and then exploiting the closed-form expression of the univariate OT to reduce the computational burden of OT. Recently, the Tree-Sliced method has been introduced to replace these lines with more intricate structures, known as tree systems. This approach enhances the ability to capture topological information of integration domains in Sliced OT while maintaining low computational cost. Inspired by this approach, in this paper, we present an adaptation of tree systems on OT problems for measures supported on a sphere. As a counterpart to the Radon transform variant on tree systems, we propose a novel spherical Radon transform with a new integration domain called spherical trees. By leveraging this transform and exploiting the spherical tree structures, we derive closed-form expressions for OT problems on the sphere. Consequently, we obtain an efficient metric for measures on the sphere, named Spherical Tree-Sliced Wasserstein (STSW) distance. We provide an extensive theoretical analysis to demonstrate the topology of spherical trees and the well-definedness and injectivity of our Radon transform variant, which leads to an orthogonally invariant distance between spherical measures. Finally, we conduct a wide range of numerical experiments, including gradient flows and self-supervised learning, to assess the performance of our proposed metric, comparing it to recent benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Applications of Large Language Model Reasoning in Feature Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing through their state of art reasoning capabilities. This paper explores the convergence of LLM reasoning techniques and feature generation for machine learning tasks. We examine four key reasoning approaches: Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and Thought Space Exploration. Our analysis reveals how these approaches can be used to identify effective feature generation rules without having to manually specify search spaces. The paper categorizes LLM-based feature generation methods across various domains including finance, healthcare, and text analytics. LLMs can extract key information from clinical notes and radiology reports in healthcare, by enabling more efficient data utilization. In finance, LLMs facilitate text generation, summarization, and entity extraction from complex documents. We analyze evaluation methodologies for assessing feature quality and downstream performance, with particular attention to OCTree's decision tree reasoning approach that provides language-based feedback for iterative improvements. Current challenges include hallucination, computational efficiency, and domain adaptation. As of March 2025, emerging approaches include inference-time compute scaling, reinforcement learning, and supervised fine-tuning with model distillation. Future directions point toward multimodal feature generation, self-improving systems, and neuro-symbolic approaches. This paper provides a detailed overview of an emerging field that promises to automate and enhance feature engineering through language model reasoning.</description>

      <title>KDSelector: A Knowledge-Enhanced and Data-Efficient Model Selector Learning Framework for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model selection has been raised as an essential problem in the area of time series anomaly detection (TSAD), because there is no single best TSAD model for the highly heterogeneous time series in real-world applications. However, despite the success of existing model selection solutions that train a classification model (especially neural network, NN) using historical data as a selector to predict the correct TSAD model for each series, the NN-based selector learning methods used by existing solutions do not make full use of the knowledge in the historical data and require iterating over all training samples, which limits the accuracy and training speed of the selector. To address these limitations, we propose KDSelector, a novel knowledge-enhanced and data-efficient framework for learning the NN-based TSAD model selector, of which three key components are specifically designed to integrate available knowledge into the selector and dynamically prune less important and redundant samples during the learning. We develop a TSAD model selection system with KDSelector as the internal, to demonstrate how users improve the accuracy and training speed of their selectors by using KDSelector as a plug-and-play module. Our demonstration video is hosted at https://youtu.be/2uqupDWvTF0.</description>

      <title>GC-Fed: Gradient Centralized Federated Learning with Partial Client Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving multi-source information fusion (MSIF) but is challenged by client drift in highly heterogeneous data settings. Many existing drift-mitigation strategies rely on reference-based techniques--such as gradient adjustments or proximal loss--that use historical snapshots (e.g., past gradients or previous global models) as reference points. When only a subset of clients participates in each training round, these historical references may not accurately capture the overall data distribution, leading to unstable training. In contrast, our proposed Gradient Centralized Federated Learning (GC-Fed) employs a hyperplane as a historically independent reference point to guide local training and enhance inter-client alignment. GC-Fed comprises two complementary components: Local GC, which centralizes gradients during local training, and Global GC, which centralizes updates during server aggregation. In our hybrid design, Local GC is applied to feature-extraction layers to harmonize client contributions, while Global GC refines classifier layers to stabilize round-wise performance. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on benchmark FL tasks demonstrate that GC-Fed effectively mitigates client drift and achieves up to a 20% improvement in accuracy under heterogeneous and partial participation conditions.</description>

      <title>A General Adaptive Dual-level Weighting Mechanism for Remote Sensing Pansharpening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Currently, deep learning-based methods for remote sensing pansharpening have advanced rapidly. However, many existing methods struggle to fully leverage feature heterogeneity and redundancy, thereby limiting their effectiveness. We use the covariance matrix to model the feature heterogeneity and redundancy and propose Correlation-Aware Covariance Weighting (CACW) to adjust them. CACW captures these correlations through the covariance matrix, which is then processed by a nonlinear function to generate weights for adjustment. Building upon CACW, we introduce a general adaptive dual-level weighting mechanism (ADWM) to address these challenges from two key perspectives, enhancing a wide range of existing deep-learning methods. First, Intra-Feature Weighting (IFW) evaluates correlations among channels within each feature to reduce redundancy and enhance unique information. Second, Cross-Feature Weighting (CFW) adjusts contributions across layers based on inter-layer correlations, refining the final output. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of ADWM compared to recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our approach through generality experiments, redundancy visualization, comparison experiments, key variables and complexity analysis, and ablation studies. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jie-1203/ADWM.</description>

      <title>JuDGE: Benchmarking Judgment Document Generation for Chinese Legal System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces JuDGE (Judgment Document Generation Evaluation), a novel benchmark for evaluating the performance of judgment document generation in the Chinese legal system. We define the task as generating a complete legal judgment document from the given factual description of the case. To facilitate this benchmark, we construct a comprehensive dataset consisting of factual descriptions from real legal cases, paired with their corresponding full judgment documents, which serve as the ground truth for evaluating the quality of generated documents. This dataset is further augmented by two external legal corpora that provide additional legal knowledge for the task: one comprising statutes and regulations, and the other consisting of a large collection of past judgment documents. In collaboration with legal professionals, we establish a comprehensive automated evaluation framework to assess the quality of generated judgment documents across various dimensions. We evaluate various baseline approaches, including few-shot in-context learning, fine-tuning, and a multi-source retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach, using both general and legal-domain LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that, while RAG approaches can effectively improve performance in this task, there is still substantial room for further improvement. All the codes and datasets are available at: https://github.com/oneal2000/JuDGE.</description>

      <title>PC-Talk: Precise Facial Animation Control for Audio-Driven Talking Face Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in audio-driven talking face generation have made great progress in lip synchronization. However, current methods often lack sufficient control over facial animation such as speaking style and emotional expression, resulting in uniform outputs. In this paper, we focus on improving two key factors: lip-audio alignment and emotion control, to enhance the diversity and user-friendliness of talking videos. Lip-audio alignment control focuses on elements like speaking style and the scale of lip movements, whereas emotion control is centered on generating realistic emotional expressions, allowing for modifications in multiple attributes such as intensity. To achieve precise control of facial animation, we propose a novel framework, PC-Talk, which enables lip-audio alignment and emotion control through implicit keypoint deformations. First, our lip-audio alignment control module facilitates precise editing of speaking styles at the word level and adjusts lip movement scales to simulate varying vocal loudness levels, maintaining lip synchronization with the audio. Second, our emotion control module generates vivid emotional facial features with pure emotional deformation. This module also enables the fine modification of intensity and the combination of multiple emotions across different facial regions. Our method demonstrates outstanding control capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both HDTF and MEAD datasets in extensive experiments.</description>

      <title>VEGGIE: Instructional Editing and Reasoning of Video Concepts with Grounded Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent video diffusion models have enhanced video editing, but it remains challenging to handle instructional editing and diverse tasks (e.g., adding, removing, changing) within a unified framework. In this paper, we introduce VEGGIE, a Video Editor with Grounded Generation from Instructions, a simple end-to-end framework that unifies video concept editing, grounding, and reasoning based on diverse user instructions. Specifically, given a video and text query, VEGGIE first utilizes an MLLM to interpret user intentions in instructions and ground them to the video contexts, generating frame-specific grounded task queries for pixel-space responses. A diffusion model then renders these plans and generates edited videos that align with user intent. To support diverse tasks and complex instructions, we employ a curriculum learning strategy: first aligning the MLLM and video diffusion model with large-scale instructional image editing data, followed by end-to-end fine-tuning on high-quality multitask video data. Additionally, we introduce a novel data synthesis pipeline to generate paired instructional video editing data for model training. It transforms static image data into diverse, high-quality video editing samples by leveraging Image-to-Video models to inject dynamics. VEGGIE shows strong performance in instructional video editing with different editing skills, outperforming the best instructional baseline as a versatile model, while other models struggle with multi-tasking. VEGGIE also excels in video object grounding and reasoning segmentation, where other baselines fail. We further reveal how the multiple tasks help each other and highlight promising applications like zero-shot multimodal instructional and in-context video editing.</description>

      <title>SAUCE: Selective Concept Unlearning in Vision-Language Models with Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlearning methods for vision-language models (VLMs) have primarily adapted techniques from large language models (LLMs), relying on weight updates that demand extensive annotated forget sets. Moreover, these methods perform unlearning at a coarse granularity, often leading to excessive forgetting and reduced model utility. To address this issue, we introduce SAUCE, a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) for fine-grained and selective concept unlearning in VLMs. Briefly, SAUCE first trains SAEs to capture high-dimensional, semantically rich sparse features. It then identifies the features most relevant to the target concept for unlearning. During inference, it selectively modifies these features to suppress specific concepts while preserving unrelated information. We evaluate SAUCE on two distinct VLMs, LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, across two types of tasks: concrete concept unlearning (objects and sports scenes) and abstract concept unlearning (emotions, colors, and materials), encompassing a total of 60 concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAUCE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 18.04% in unlearning quality while maintaining comparable model utility. Furthermore, we investigate SAUCE's robustness against widely used adversarial attacks, its transferability across models, and its scalability in handling multiple simultaneous unlearning requests. Our findings establish SAUCE as an effective and scalable solution for selective concept unlearning in VLMs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: This study introduces a Vision-Language Model (VLM) leveraging SIGLIP and Gemma-3b architectures for automated acute tuberculosis (TB) screening. By integrating chest X-ray images and clinical notes, the model aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, particularly in resource-limited settings.
  Methods: The VLM combines visual data from chest X-rays with clinical context to generate detailed, context-aware diagnostic reports. The architecture employs SIGLIP for visual encoding and Gemma-3b for decoding, ensuring effective representation of acute TB-specific pathologies and clinical insights.
  Results: Key acute TB pathologies, including consolidation, cavities, and nodules, were detected with high precision (97percent) and recall (96percent). The model demonstrated strong spatial localization capabilities and robustness in distinguishing TB-positive cases, making it a reliable tool for acute TB diagnosis.
  Conclusion: The multimodal capability of the VLM reduces reliance on radiologists, providing a scalable solution for acute TB screening. Future work will focus on improving the detection of subtle pathologies and addressing dataset biases to enhance its generalizability and application in diverse global healthcare settings.</description>

      <title>Workflow for Safe-AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development and deployment of safe and dependable AI models is crucial in applications where functional safety is a key concern. Given the rapid advancement in AI research and the relative novelty of the safe-AI domain, there is an increasing need for a workflow that balances stability with adaptability. This work proposes a transparent, complete, yet flexible and lightweight workflow that highlights both reliability and qualifiability. The core idea is that the workflow must be qualifiable, which demands the use of qualified tools. Tool qualification is a resource-intensive process, both in terms of time and cost. We therefore place value on a lightweight workflow featuring a minimal number of tools with limited features. The workflow is built upon an extended ONNX model description allowing for validation of AI algorithms from their generation to runtime deployment. This validation is essential to ensure that models are validated before being reliably deployed across different runtimes, particularly in mixed-criticality systems.

      <title>Conjuring Positive Pairs for Efficient Unification of Representation Learning and Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While representation learning and generative modeling seek to understand visual data, unifying both domains remains unexplored. Recent Unified Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods have started to bridge the gap between both paradigms. However, they rely solely on semantic token reconstruction, which requires an external tokenizer during training -- introducing a significant overhead. In this work, we introduce Sorcen, a novel unified SSL framework, incorporating a synergic Contrastive-Reconstruction objective. Our Contrastive objective, "Echo Contrast", leverages the generative capabilities of Sorcen, eliminating the need for additional image crops or augmentations during training. Sorcen "generates" an echo sample in the semantic token space, forming the contrastive positive pair. Sorcen operates exclusively on precomputed tokens, eliminating the need for an online token transformation during training, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1k demonstrate that Sorcen outperforms the previous Unified SSL SoTA by 0.4%, 1.48 FID, 1.76%, and 1.53% on linear probing, unconditional image generation, few-shot learning, and transfer learning, respectively, while being 60.8% more efficient. Additionally, Sorcen surpasses previous single-crop MIM SoTA in linear probing and achieves SoTA performance in unconditional image generation, highlighting significant improvements and breakthroughs in Unified SSL models.</description>

      <title>BigO(Bench) -- Can LLMs Generate Code with Controlled Time and Space Complexity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce BigO(Bench), a novel coding benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of generative language models in understanding and generating code with specified time and space complexities. This benchmark addresses the gap in current evaluations that often overlook the ability of models to comprehend and produce code constrained by computational complexity. BigO(Bench) includes tooling to infer the algorithmic complexity of any Python function from profiling measurements, including human- or LLM-generated solutions. BigO(Bench) also includes of set of 3,105 coding problems and 1,190,250 solutions from Code Contests annotated with inferred (synthetic) time and space complexity labels from the complexity framework, as well as corresponding runtime and memory footprint values for a large set of input sizes. We present results from evaluating multiple state-of-the-art language models on this benchmark, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in handling complexity requirements. In particular, token-space reasoning models are unrivaled in code generation but not in complexity understanding, hinting that they may not generalize well to tasks for which no reward was given at training time.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Bi-Elman Attention Networks (DBEAN): Dual-Directional Context-Aware Representation Learning for Enhanced Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text classification, a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), aims to categorize textual data into predefined labels. Traditional methods struggled with complex linguistic structures and semantic dependencies. The advent of deep learning, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Transformer-based models, has significantly advanced the field by enabling nuanced feature extraction and context-aware predictions. Despite improvements, existing models exhibit limitations in balancing interpretability, computational efficiency, and long-range contextual understanding. This paper proposes the Dynamic Bidirectional Elman with Attention Network (DBEAN), which integrates bidirectional temporal modelling with self-attention mechanisms. DBEAN dynamically assigns weights to critical segments of input, improving contextual representation while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>
