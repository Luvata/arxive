      <title>Physical Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital AI systems spanning large language models, vision models, and generative architectures that operate primarily in symbolic, linguistic, or pixel domains. They have achieved striking progress, but almost all of this progress lives in virtual spaces. These systems transform embeddings and tokens, yet do not themselves touch the world and rarely admit a physical interpretation. In this work we propose a physical transformer that couples modern transformer style computation with geometric representation and physical dynamics. At the micro level, attention heads, and feed-forward blocks are modeled as interacting spins governed by effective Hamiltonians plus non-Hamiltonian bath terms. At the meso level, their aggregated state evolves on a learned Neural Differential Manifold (NDM) under Hamiltonian flows and Hamilton, Jacobi, Bellman (HJB) optimal control, discretized by symplectic layers that approximately preserve geometric and energetic invariants. At the macro level, the model maintains a generative semantic workspace and a two-dimensional information-phase portrait that tracks uncertainty and information gain over a reasoning trajectory. Within this hierarchy, reasoning tasks are formulated as controlled information flows on the manifold, with solutions corresponding to low cost trajectories that satisfy geometric, energetic, and workspace-consistency constraints. On simple toy problems involving numerical integration and dynamical systems, the physical transformer outperforms naive baselines in stability and long-horizon accuracy, highlighting the benefits of respecting underlying geometric and Hamiltonian structure. More broadly, the framework suggests a path toward physical AI that unify digital reasoning with physically grounded manifolds, opening a route to more interpretable and potentially unified models of reasoning, control, and interaction with the real world.</description>

      <title>WebGym: Scaling Training Environments for Visual Web Agents with Realistic Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present WebGym, the largest-to-date open-source environment for training realistic visual web agents. Real websites are non-stationary and diverse, making artificial or small-scale task sets insufficient for robust policy learning. WebGym contains nearly 300,000 tasks with rubric-based evaluations across diverse, real-world websites and difficulty levels. We train agents with a simple reinforcement learning (RL) recipe, which trains on the agent's own interaction traces (rollouts), using task rewards as feedback to guide learning. To enable scaling RL, we speed up sampling of trajectories in WebGym by developing a high-throughput asynchronous rollout system, designed specifically for web agents. Our system achieves a 4-5x rollout speedup compared to naive implementations. Second, we scale the task set breadth, depth, and size, which results in continued performance improvement. Fine-tuning a strong base vision-language model, Qwen-3-VL-8B-Instruct, on WebGym results in an improvement in success rate on an out-of-distribution test set from 26.2% to 42.9%, significantly outperforming agents based on proprietary models such as GPT-4o and GPT-5-Thinking that achieve 27.1% and 29.8%, respectively. This improvement is substantial because our test set consists only of tasks on websites never seen during training, unlike many other prior works on training visual web agents.</description>

      <title>mHC-GNN: Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from over-smoothing in deep architectures and expressiveness bounded by the 1-Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) test. We adapt Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (\mhc)~\citep{xie2025mhc}, recently proposed for Transformers, to graph neural networks. Our method, mHC-GNN, expands node representations across $n$ parallel streams and constrains stream-mixing matrices to the Birkhoff polytope via Sinkhorn-Knopp normalization. We prove that mHC-GNN exhibits exponentially slower over-smoothing (rate $(1-\gamma)^{L/n}$ vs.\ $(1-\gamma)^L$) and can distinguish graphs beyond 1-WL. Experiments on 10 datasets with 4 GNN architectures show consistent improvements. Depth experiments from 2 to 128 layers reveal that standard GNNs collapse to near-random performance beyond 16 layers, while mHC-GNN maintains over 74\% accuracy even at 128 layers, with improvements exceeding 50 percentage points at extreme depths. Ablations confirm that the manifold constraint is essential: removing it causes up to 82\% performance degradation.

      <title>Polynomial Convergence of Riemannian Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable empirical success in the recent years and are considered one of the state-of-the-art generative models in modern AI. These models consist of a forward process, which gradually diffuses the data distribution to a noise distribution spanning the whole space, and a backward process, which inverts this transformation to recover the data distribution from noise. Most of the existing literature assumes that the underlying space is Euclidean. However, in many practical applications, the data are constrained to lie on a submanifold of Euclidean space. Addressing this setting, De Bortoli et al. (2022) introduced Riemannian diffusion models and proved that using an exponentially small step size yields a small sampling error in the Wasserstein distance, provided the data distribution is smooth and strictly positive, and the score estimate is $L_\infty$-accurate. In this paper, we greatly strengthen this theory by establishing that, under $L_2$-accurate score estimate, a {\em polynomially small stepsize} suffices to guarantee small sampling error in the total variation distance, without requiring smoothness or positivity of the data distribution. Our analysis only requires mild and standard curvature assumptions on the underlying manifold. The main ingredients in our analysis are Li-Yau estimate for the log-gradient of heat kernel, and Minakshisundaram-Pleijel parametrix expansion of the perturbed heat equation. Our approach opens the door to a sharper analysis of diffusion models on non-Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>GEM-Style Constraints for PEFT with Dual Gradient Projection in LoRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally costly, motivating Continual Learning (CL) approaches that utilize parameter-efficient adapters. We revisit Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) within the Low-Rank Adapter (LoRA) subspace and introduce I-GEM: a fixed-budget, GPU-resident dual projected-gradient approximation to GEM's quadratic projection. By constraining non-interference solely within the adapter parameters, I-GEM preserves GEM-like stability with orders-of-magnitude lower mean projection overhead. On a 3-task AG News split with induced domain drift, using GPT-2 (355M) and LoRA ($r=8$), I-GEM matches GEM's average accuracy (within $\sim\!0.04$ pts) and outperforms A-GEM by $\sim\!1.4$ pts. Crucially, it reduces projection time vs.\ GEM by a factor of $\sim\!10^3$. These results suggest that applying GEM constraints in the LoRA subspace is a practical pathway for continual learning at the LLM scale.</description>

      <title>hdlib 2.0: Extending Machine Learning Capabilities of Vector-Symbolic Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the initial publication of hdlib, a Python library for designing Vector-Symbolic Architectures (VSA), we introduce a major extension that significantly enhances its machine learning capabilities. VSA, also known as Hyperdimensional Computing, is a computing paradigm that represents and processes information using high-dimensional vectors. While the first version of hdlib established a robust foundation for creating and manipulating these vectors, this update addresses the growing need for more advanced, data-driven modeling within the VSA framework. Here, we present four extensions: significant enhancements to the existing supervised classification model also enabling feature selection, and a new regression model for predicting continuous variables, a clustering model for unsupervised learning, and a graph-based learning model. Furthermore, we propose the first implementation ever of Quantum Hyperdimensional Computing with quantum-powered arithmetic operations and a new Quantum Machine Learning model for supervised learning. hdlib remains open-source and available on GitHub at https://github.com/cumbof/hdlib under the MIT license, and distributed through the Python Package Index (pip install hdlib) and Conda (conda install -c conda-forge hdlib). Documentation and examples of these new features are available on the official Wiki at https://github.com/cumbof/hdlib/wiki.</description>

      <title>LLM-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting anomalies in time series data is crucial for finance, healthcare, sensor networks, and industrial monitoring applications. However, time series anomaly detection often suffers from sparse labels, complex temporal patterns, and costly expert annotation. We propose a unified framework that integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-based potential functions for reward shaping with Reinforcement Learning (RL), Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-enhanced dynamic reward scaling, and active learning with label propagation. An LSTM-based RL agent leverages LLM-derived semantic rewards to guide exploration, while VAE reconstruction errors add unsupervised anomaly signals. Active learning selects the most uncertain samples, and label propagation efficiently expands labeled data. Evaluations on Yahoo-A1 and SMD benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy under limited labeling budgets and operates effectively in data-constrained settings. This study highlights the promise of combining LLMs with RL and advanced unsupervised techniques for robust, scalable anomaly detection in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale Graph Autoregressive Modeling: Molecular Property Prediction via Next Token Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Connection-Aware Motif Sequencing (CamS), a graph-to-sequence representation that enables decoder-only Transformers to learn molecular graphs via standard next-token prediction (NTP). For molecular property prediction, SMILES-based NTP scales well but lacks explicit topology, whereas graph-native masked modeling captures connectivity but risks disrupting the pivotal chemical details (e.g., activity cliffs). CamS bridges this gap by serializing molecular graphs into structure-rich causal sequences. CamS first mines data-driven connection-aware motifs. It then serializes motifs via scaffold-rooted breadth-first search (BFS) to establish a stable core-to-periphery order. Crucially, CamS enables hierarchical modeling by concatenating sequences from fine to coarse motif scales, allowing the model to condition global scaffolds on dense, uncorrupted local structural evidence. We instantiate CamS-LLaMA by pre-training a vanilla LLaMA backbone on CamS sequences. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on MoleculeNet and the activity-cliff benchmark MoleculeACE, outperforming both SMILES-based language models and strong graph baselines. Interpretability analysis confirms that our multi-scale causal serialization effectively drives attention toward cliff-determining differences.</description>

      <title>Normalized Conditional Mutual Information Surrogate Loss for Deep Neural Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel information theoretic surrogate loss; normalized conditional mutual information (NCMI); as a drop in alternative to the de facto cross-entropy (CE) for training deep neural network (DNN) based classifiers. We first observe that the model's NCMI is inversely proportional to its accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce an alternating algorithm to efficiently minimize the NCMI. Across image recognition and whole-slide imaging (WSI) subtyping benchmarks, NCMI-trained models surpass state of the art losses by substantial margins at a computational cost comparable to that of CE. Notably, on ImageNet, NCMI yields a 2.77% top-1 accuracy improvement with ResNet-50 comparing to the CE; on CAMELYON-17, replacing CE with NCMI improves the macro-F1 by 8.6% over the strongest baseline. Gains are consistent across various architectures and batch sizes, suggesting that NCMI is a practical and competitive alternative to CE.</description>

      <title>CutisAI: Deep Learning Framework for Automated Dermatology and Cancer Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of dermatological imaging and mobile diagnostic tools calls for systems that not only demonstrate empirical performance but also provide strong theoretical guarantees. Deep learning models have shown high predictive accuracy; however, they are often criticized for lacking well, calibrated uncertainty estimates without which these models are hardly deployable in a clinical setting. To this end, we present the Conformal Bayesian Dermatological Classifier (CBDC), a well, founded framework that combines Statistical Learning Theory, Topological Data Analysis (TDA), and Bayesian Conformal Inference. CBDC offers distribution, dependent generalization bounds that reflect dermatological variability, proves a topological stability theorem that guarantees the invariance of convolutional neural network embeddings under photometric and morphological perturbations and provides finite conformal coverage guarantees for trustworthy uncertainty quantification.
  Through exhaustive experiments on the HAM10000, PH2, and ISIC 2020 datasets, we show that CBDC not only attains classification accuracy but also generates calibrated predictions that are interpretable from a clinical perspective. This research constitutes a theoretical and practical leap for deep dermatological diagnostics, thereby opening the machine learning theory clinical applicability interface.</description>

      <title>LendNova: Towards Automated Credit Risk Assessment with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Credit risk assessment is essential in the financial sector, but has traditionally depended on costly feature-based models that often fail to utilize all available information in raw credit records. This paper introduces LendNova, the first practical automated end-to-end pipeline for credit risk assessment, designed to utilize all available information in raw credit records by leveraging advanced NLP techniques and language models. LendNova transforms risk modeling by operating directly on raw, jargon-heavy credit bureau text using a language model that learns task-relevant representations without manual feature engineering. By automatically capturing patterns and risk signals embedded in the text, it replaces manual preprocessing steps, reducing costs and improving scalability. Evaluation on real-world data further demonstrates its strong potential in accurate and efficient risk assessment. LendNova establishes a baseline for intelligent credit risk agents, demonstrating the feasibility of language models in this domain. It lays the groundwork for future research toward foundation systems that enable more accurate, adaptable, and automated financial decision-making.</description>

      <title>Threat Detection in Social Media Networks Using Machine Learning Based Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accelerated development of social media websites has posed intricate security issues in cyberspace, where these sites have increasingly become victims of criminal activities including attempts to intrude into them, abnormal traffic patterns, and organized attacks. The conventional rule-based security systems are not always scalable and dynamic to meet such a threat. This paper introduces a threat detection framework based on machine learning that can be used to classify malicious behavior in the social media network environment based on the nature of network traffic. Exploiting a rich network traffic dataset, the massive preprocessing and exploratory data analysis is conducted to overcome the problem of data imbalance, feature inconsistency, and noise. A model of artificial neural network (ANN) is then created to acquire intricate, non-linear tendencies of malicious actions. The proposed model is tested on conventional performance metrics, such as accuracy, accuracy, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, and shows good detection and high levels of strength. The findings suggest that neural network-based solutions have the potential to be used effectively to identify the latent threat dynamics within the context of a large-scale social media network and that they can be employed to complement the existing intrusion detection system and better to conduct proactive cybersecurity operations.</description>

      <title>Chronicals: A High-Performance Framework for LLM Fine-Tuning with 3.51x Speedup over Unsloth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model fine-tuning is bottlenecked by memory: a 7B parameter model requires 84GB--14GB for weights, 14GB for gradients, and 56GB for FP32 optimizer states--exceeding even A100-40GB capacity. We present Chronicals, an open-source training framework achieving 3.51x speedup over Unsloth through four synergistic optimizations: (1) fused Triton kernels eliminating 75% of memory traffic via RMSNorm (7x), SwiGLU (5x), and QK-RoPE (2.3x) fusion; (2) Cut Cross-Entropy reducing logit memory from 5GB to 135MB through online softmax computation; (3) LoRA+ with theoretically-derived 16x differential learning rates between adapter matrices; and (4) Best-Fit Decreasing sequence packing recovering 60-75% of compute wasted on padding.
  On Qwen2.5-0.5B with A100-40GB, Chronicals achieves 41,184 tokens/second for full fine-tuning versus Unsloth's 11,736 tokens/second (3.51x). For LoRA at rank 32, we reach 11,699 tokens/second versus Unsloth MAX's 2,857 tokens/second (4.10x). Critically, we discovered that Unsloth's reported 46,000 tokens/second benchmark exhibited zero gradient norms--the model was not training.
  We provide complete mathematical foundations: online softmax correctness proofs, FlashAttention IO complexity bounds O(N^2 d^2 M^{-1}), LoRA+ learning rate derivations from gradient magnitude analysis, and bin-packing approximation guarantees. All implementations, benchmarks, and proofs are available at https://github.com/Ajwebdevs/Chronicals with pip installation via https://pypi.org/project/chronicals/.</description>

Noise correlation, which estimates gradients by correlating perturbations of activity with changes in output, provides a biologically plausible solution to credit assignment but scales poorly as accurately estimating the Jacobian requires that the number of perturbations scale with network size. Moreover, isotropic noise conflicts with neurobiological observations that neural activity lies on a low-dimensional manifold. To address these drawbacks, we propose neural manifold noise correlation (NMNC), which performs credit assignment using perturbations restricted to the neural manifold. We show theoretically and empirically that the Jacobian row space aligns with the neural manifold in trained networks, and that manifold dimensionality scales slowly with network size. NMNC substantially improves performance and sample efficiency over vanilla noise correlation in convolutional networks trained on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-scale models, and recurrent networks. NMNC also yields representations more similar to the primate visual system than vanilla noise correlation. These findings offer a mechanistic hypothesis for how biological circuits could support credit assignment, and suggest that biologically inspired constraints may enable, rather than limit, effective learning at scale.</description>

      <title>Prioritized Replay for RL Post-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a problem-level prioritization framework for RL post-training of large language models. Building on insights from prioritized replay in deep RL, as well as prior observations that rollouts with intermediate success rates tend to produce stronger learning signals under methods such as GRPO, our approach selects problems according to a simple, model-driven priority score derived from empirical success statistics. In contrast to conventional curriculum strategies that emphasize easier tasks early in training, the resulting schedule naturally focuses training on problems that are neither consistently solved nor consistently failed, while deprioritizing those that contribute little gradient information. The method yields a continuously adapting and automatic prioritization process that requires no predefined difficulty tiers, auxiliary predictors, or external labels. We further introduce lightweight mechanisms for practical deployment, including heap-based prioritized sampling and periodic retesting of solved and unsolved problems to mitigate starvation and forgetting. Overall, the approach offers a principled and scalable alternative to manually designed curricula while aligning data selection directly with the dynamics of GRPO-based post-training.</description>

      <title>When Prompting Meets Spiking: Graph Sparse Prompting via Spiking Graph Prompt Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) learning has been widely used in adapting pre-trained GNN model on the downstream task. GPFs first introduce some prompt atoms and then learns the optimal prompt vector for each graph node using the linear combination of prompt atoms. However, existing GPFs generally conduct prompting over node's all feature dimensions which is obviously redundant and also be sensitive to node feature noise. To overcome this issue, for the first time, this paper proposes learning sparse graph prompts by leveraging the spiking neuron mechanism, termed Spiking Graph Prompt Feature (SpikingGPF). Our approach is motivated by the observation that spiking neuron can perform inexpensive information processing and produce sparse outputs which naturally fits the task of our graph sparse prompting. Specifically, SpikingGPF has two main aspects. First, it learns a sparse prompt vector for each node by exploiting a spiking neuron architecture, enabling prompting on selective node features. This yields a more compact and lightweight prompting design while also improving robustness against node noise. Second, SpikingGPF introduces a novel prompt representation learning model based on sparse representation theory, i.e., it represents each node prompt as a sparse combination of prompt atoms. This encourages a more compact representation and also facilitates efficient computation. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpikingGPF.</description>

      <title>MAFS: Multi-head Attention Feature Selection for High-Dimensional Data via Deep Fusion of Filter Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature selection is essential for high-dimensional biomedical data, enabling stronger predictive performance, reduced computational cost, and improved interpretability in precision medicine applications. Existing approaches face notable challenges. Filter methods are highly scalable but cannot capture complex relationships or eliminate redundancy. Deep learning-based approaches can model nonlinear patterns but often lack stability, interpretability, and efficiency at scale. Single-head attention improves interpretability but is limited in capturing multi-level dependencies and remains sensitive to initialization, reducing reproducibility. Most existing methods rarely combine statistical interpretability with the representational power of deep learning, particularly in ultra-high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce MAFS (Multi-head Attention-based Feature Selection), a hybrid framework that integrates statistical priors with deep learning capabilities. MAFS begins with filter-based priors for stable initialization and guide learning. It then uses multi-head attention to examine features from multiple perspectives in parallel, capturing complex nonlinear relationships and interactions. Finally, a reordering module consolidates outputs across attention heads, resolving conflicts and minimizing information loss to generate robust and consistent feature rankings. This design combines statistical guidance with deep modeling capacity, yielding interpretable importance scores while maximizing retention of informative signals. Across simulated and real-world datasets, including cancer gene expression and Alzheimer's disease data, MAFS consistently achieves superior coverage and stability compared with existing filter-based and deep learning-based alternatives, offering a scalable, interpretable, and robust solution for feature selection in high-dimensional biomedical data.</description>

      <title>Uni-FinLLM: A Unified Multimodal Large Language Model with Modular Task Heads for Micro-Level Stock Prediction and Macro-Level Systemic Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial institutions and regulators require systems that integrate heterogeneous data to assess risks from stock fluctuations to systemic vulnerabilities. Existing approaches often treat these tasks in isolation, failing to capture cross-scale dependencies. We propose Uni-FinLLM, a unified multimodal large language model that uses a shared Transformer backbone and modular task heads to jointly process financial text, numerical time series, fundamentals, and visual data. Through cross-modal attention and multi-task optimization, it learns a coherent representation for micro-, meso-, and macro-level predictions. Evaluated on stock forecasting, credit-risk assessment, and systemic-risk detection, Uni-FinLLM significantly outperforms baselines. It raises stock directional accuracy to 67.4% (from 61.7%), credit-risk accuracy to 84.1% (from 79.6%), and macro early-warning accuracy to 82.3%. Results validate that a unified multimodal LLM can jointly model asset behavior and systemic vulnerabilities, offering a scalable decision-support engine for finance.</description>

      <title>Topology-Independent Robustness of the Weighted Mean under Label Poisoning Attacks in Heterogeneous Decentralized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robustness to malicious attacks is crucial for practical decentralized signal processing and machine learning systems. A typical example of such attacks is label poisoning, meaning that some agents possess corrupted local labels and share models trained on these poisoned data. To defend against malicious attacks, existing works often focus on designing robust aggregators; meanwhile, the weighted mean aggregator is typically considered a simple, vulnerable baseline. This paper analyzes the robustness of decentralized gradient descent under label poisoning attacks, considering both robust and weighted mean aggregators. Theoretical results reveal that the learning errors of robust aggregators depend on the network topology, whereas the performance of weighted mean aggregator is topology-independent. Remarkably, the weighted mean aggregator, although often considered vulnerable, can outperform robust aggregators under sufficient heterogeneity, particularly when: (i) the global contamination rate (i.e., the fraction of poisoned agents for the entire network) is smaller than the local contamination rate (i.e., the maximal fraction of poisoned neighbors for the regular agents); (ii) the network of regular agents is disconnected; or (iii) the network of regular agents is sparse and the local contamination rate is high. Empirical results support our theoretical findings, highlighting the important role of network topology in the robustness to label poisoning attacks.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws of Machine Learning for Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal power flow (OPF) is one of the fundamental tasks for power system operations. While machine learning (ML) approaches such as deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely studied to enhance OPF solution speed and performance, their practical deployment faces two critical scaling questions: What is the minimum training data volume required for reliable results? How should ML models' complexity balance accuracy with real-time computational limits? Existing studies evaluate discrete scenarios without quantifying these scaling relationships, leading to trial-and-error-based ML development in real-world applications. This work presents the first systematic scaling study for ML-based OPF across two dimensions: data scale (0.1K-40K training samples) and compute scale (multiple NN architectures with varying FLOPs). Our results reveal consistent power-law relationships on both DNNs and physics-informed NNs (PINNs) between each resource dimension and three core performance metrics: prediction error (MAE), constraint violations and speed. We find that for ACOPF, the accuracy metric scales with dataset size and training compute. These scaling laws enable predictable and principled ML pipeline design for OPF. We further identify the divergence between prediction accuracy and constraint feasibility and characterize the compute-optimal frontier. This work provides quantitative guidance for ML-OPF design and deployments.</description>

      <title>CRoPE: Efficient Parametrization of Rotary Positional Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotary positional embedding has become the state-of-the-art approach to encode position information in transformer-based models. While it is often succinctly expressed in complex linear algebra, we note that the actual implementation of $Q/K/V$-projections is not equivalent to a complex linear transformation. We argue that complex linear transformation is a more natural parametrization and saves near 50\% parameters within the attention block. We show empirically that removing such redundancy has negligible impact on the model performance both in sample and out of sample. Our modification achieves more efficient parameter usage, as well as a cleaner interpretation of the representation space.</description>

      <title>Scalable Tree Ensemble Proximities in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree ensemble methods such as Random Forests naturally induce supervised similarity measures through their decision tree structure, but existing implementations of proximities derived from tree ensembles typically suffer from quadratic time or memory complexity, limiting their scalability. In this work, we introduce a general framework for efficient proximity computation by defining a family of Separable Weighted Leaf-Collision Proximities. We show that any proximity measure in this family admits an exact sparse matrix factorization, restricting computation to leaf-level collisions and avoiding explicit pairwise comparisons. This formulation enables low-memory, scalable proximity computation using sparse linear algebra in Python. Empirical benchmarks demonstrate substantial runtime and memory improvements over traditional approaches, allowing tree ensemble proximities to scale efficiently to datasets with hundreds of thousands of samples on standard CPU hardware.</description>

      <title>Q-Regularized Generative Auto-Bidding: From Suboptimal Trajectories to Optimal Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of e-commerce, auto-bidding has become a key asset in optimizing advertising performance under diverse advertiser environments. The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning.
  To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives. Notably, in large-scale real-world A/B testing, QGA achieves a 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and a 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI.</description>

      <title>RadioDiff-Flux: Efficient Radio Map Construction via Generative Denoise Diffusion Model Trajectory Midpoint Reuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate radio map (RM) construction is essential to enabling environment-aware and adaptive wireless communication. However, in future 6G scenarios characterized by high-speed network entities and fast-changing environments, it is very challenging to meet real-time requirements. Although generative diffusion models (DMs) can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with second-level delay, their iterative nature leads to prohibitive inference latency in delay-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, by uncovering a key structural property of diffusion processes: the latent midpoints remain highly consistent across semantically similar scenes, we propose RadioDiff-Flux, a novel two-stage latent diffusion framework that decouples static environmental modeling from dynamic refinement, enabling the reuse of precomputed midpoints to bypass redundant denoising. In particular, the first stage generates a coarse latent representation using only static scene features, which can be cached and shared across similar scenarios. The second stage adapts this representation to dynamic conditions and transmitter locations using a pre-trained model, thereby avoiding repeated early-stage computation. The proposed RadioDiff-Flux significantly reduces inference time while preserving fidelity. Experiment results show that RadioDiff-Flux can achieve up to 50 acceleration with less than 0.15% accuracy loss, demonstrating its practical utility for fast, scalable RM generation in future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Stratified Hazard Sampling: Minimal-Variance Event Scheduling for CTMC/DTMC Discrete Diffusion and Flow Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CTMC/DTMC-based discrete generative models, including uniform-noise discrete diffusion (e.g., D3PM/CTDD) and discrete flow matching, enable non-autoregressive sequence generation by repeatedly replacing tokens through a time-inhomogeneous Markov process. Inference is typically implemented with step-based simulation: each token decides to jump via independent Bernoulli (or categorical) draws at every discretization step. Under uniform-noise initialization, where self-correction requires multiple edits per position, these independent decisions induce substantial variance in both the number and timing of edits, leading to characteristic failure modes such as under-editing (residual noise) or over-editing (cascading unnecessary substitutions), decreasing reproducibility.
  We propose Stratified Hazard Sampling (SHS), a drop-in and hyperparameter-free inference principle for any sampler that admits a stay-vs.-replace decomposition. SHS models per-token edits as events driven by cumulative hazard (CTMC) or cumulative jump mass (DTMC) and places events by stratifying this cumulative quantity: with a single random phase per position, a token jumps whenever its accumulated hazard crosses unit-spaced thresholds. This preserves the expected number of jumps while achieving the minimum possible variance among unbiased integer estimators (bounded by 1/4), without altering per-jump destination sampling and thus retaining multimodality. We also introduce a phase-allocation variant for blacklist-style lexical constraints that prioritizes early edits at high-risk positions to mitigate late-masking artifacts.</description>

      <title>Electricity Price Forecasting: Bridging Linear Models, Neural Networks and Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise day-ahead forecasts for electricity prices are crucial to ensure efficient portfolio management, support strategic decision-making for power plant operations, enable efficient battery storage optimization, and facilitate demand response planning. However, developing an accurate prediction model is highly challenging in an uncertain and volatile market environment. For instance, although linear models generally exhibit competitive performance in predicting electricity prices with minimal computational requirements, they fail to capture relevant nonlinear relationships. Nonlinear models, on the other hand, can improve forecasting accuracy with a surge in computational costs. We propose a novel multivariate neural network approach that combines linear and nonlinear feed-forward neural structures. Unlike previous hybrid models, our approach integrates online learning and forecast combination for efficient training and accuracy improvement. It also incorporates all relevant characteristics, particularly the fundamental relationships arising from wind and solar generation, electricity demand patterns, related energy fuel and carbon markets, in addition to autoregressive dynamics and calendar effects. Compared to the current state-of-the-art benchmark models, the proposed forecasting method significantly reduces computational cost while delivering superior forecasting accuracy (12-13% RMSE and 15-18% MAE reductions). Our results are derived from a six-year forecasting study conducted on major European electricity markets.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Neural Contextual Bandit Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic contextual bandits are fundamental for sequential decision-making but pose significant challenges for existing neural network-based algorithms, particularly when scaling to quantum neural networks (QNNs) due to issues such as massive over-parameterization, computational instability, and the barren plateau phenomenon. This paper introduces the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel-Upper Confidence Bound (QNTK-UCB) algorithm, a novel algorithm that leverages the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel (QNTK) to address these limitations.
  By freezing the QNN at a random initialization and utilizing its static QNTK as a kernel for ridge regression, QNTK-UCB bypasses the unstable training dynamics inherent in explicit parameterized quantum circuit training while fully exploiting the unique quantum inductive bias. For a time horizon $T$ and $K$ actions, our theoretical analysis reveals a significantly improved parameter scaling of $\Omega((TK)^3)$ for QNTK-UCB, a substantial reduction compared to $\Omega((TK)^8)$ required by classical NeuralUCB algorithms for similar regret guarantees. Empirical evaluations on non-linear synthetic benchmarks and quantum-native variational quantum eigensolver tasks demonstrate QNTK-UCB's superior sample efficiency in low-data regimes. This work highlights how the inherent properties of QNTK provide implicit regularization and a sharper spectral decay, paving the way for achieving ``quantum advantage'' in online learning.</description>

      <title>Domain Generalization for Time Series: Enhancing Drilling Regression Models for Stick-Slip Index Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive comparison of domain generalization techniques applied to time series data within a drilling context, focusing on the prediction of a continuous Stick-Slip Index (SSI), a critical metric for assessing torsional downhole vibrations at the drill bit. The study aims to develop a robust regression model that can generalize across domains by training on 60 second labeled sequences of 1 Hz surface drilling data to predict the SSI. The model is tested in wells that are different from those used during training. To fine-tune the model architecture, a grid search approach is employed to optimize key hyperparameters. A comparative analysis of the Adversarial Domain Generalization (ADG), Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and baseline models is presented, along with an evaluation of the effectiveness of transfer learning (TL) in improving model performance. The ADG and IRM models achieve performance improvements of 10% and 8%, respectively, over the baseline model. Most importantly, severe events are detected 60% of the time, against 20% for the baseline model. Overall, the results indicate that both ADG and IRM models surpass the baseline, with the ADG model exhibiting a slight advantage over the IRM model. Additionally, applying TL to a pre-trained model further improves performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of domain generalization approaches in drilling applications, with ADG emerging as the most effective approach.</description>

      <title>RPIQ: Residual-Projected Multi-Collaboration Closed-Loop and Single Instance Quantization for Visually Impaired Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visually impaired users face significant challenges in daily information access and real-time environmental perception, and there is an urgent need for intelligent assistive systems with accurate recognition capabilities. Although large-scale models provide effective solutions for perception and reasoning, their practical deployment on assistive devices is severely constrained by excessive memory consumption and high inference costs. Moreover, existing quantization strategies often ignore inter-block error accumulation, leading to degraded model stability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel quantization framework -- Residual-Projected Multi-Collaboration Closed-Loop and Single Instance Quantization(RPIQ), whose quantization process adopts a multi-collaborative closed-loop compensation scheme based on Single Instance Calibration and Gauss-Seidel Iterative Quantization. Experiments on various types of large-scale models, including language models such as OPT, Qwen, and LLaMA, as well as vision-language models such as CogVLM2, demonstrate that RPIQ can compress models to 4-bit representation while significantly reducing peak memory consumption (approximately 60%-75% reduction compared to original full-precision models). The method maintains performance highly close to full-precision models across multiple language and visual tasks, and exhibits excellent recognition and reasoning capabilities in key applications such as text understanding and visual question answering in complex scenarios. While verifying the effectiveness of RPIQ for deployment in real assistive systems, this study also advances the computational efficiency and reliability of large models, enabling them to provide visually impaired users with the required information accurately and rapidly.</description>

      <title>Bridging Mechanistic Interpretability and Prompt Engineering with Gradient Ascent for Interpretable Persona Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling emergent behavioral personas (e.g., sycophancy, hallucination) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for AI safety, yet remains a persistent challenge. Existing solutions face a dilemma: manual prompt engineering is intuitive but unscalable and imprecise, while automatic optimization methods are effective but operate as "black boxes" with no interpretable connection to model internals. We propose a novel framework that adapts gradient ascent to LLMs, enabling targeted prompt discovery. In specific, we propose two methods, RESGA and SAEGA, that both optimize randomly initialized prompts to achieve better aligned representation with an identified persona direction. We introduce fluent gradient ascent to control the fluency of discovered persona steering prompts. We demonstrate RESGA and SAEGA's effectiveness across Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, and Gemma 3 for steering three different personas,sycophancy, hallucination, and myopic reward. Crucially, on sycophancy, our automatically discovered prompts achieve significant improvement (49.90% compared with 79.24%). By grounding prompt discovery in mechanistically meaningful features, our method offers a new paradigm for controllable and interpretable behavior modification.</description>

      <title>ChemBART: A Pre-trained BART Model Assisting Organic Chemistry Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential across diverse fields. While LLMs have been applied to molecular simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) in computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP), existing methodologies typically address single tasks, such as precursor prediction. We introduce ChemBART, a SMILES-based LLM pre-trained on chemical reactions, which enables a unified model for multiple downstream chemical tasks--achieving the paradigm of "one model, one pre-training, multiple tasks." By leveraging outputs from a mask-filling pre-training task on reaction expressions, ChemBART effectively solves a variety of chemical problems, including precursor/reagent generation, temperature-yield regression, molecular property classification, and optimizing the policy and value functions within a reinforcement learning framework, integrated with Monte Carlo tree search for multi-step synthesis route design. Unlike single-molecule pre-trained LLMs constrained to specific applications, ChemBART addresses broader chemical challenges and integrates them for comprehensive synthesis planning. Crucially, ChemBART-designed multi-step synthesis routes and reaction conditions directly inspired wet-lab validation, which confirmed shorter pathways with ~30% yield improvement over literature benchmarks. Our work validates the power of reaction-focused pre-training and showcases the broad utility of ChemBART in advancing the complete synthesis planning cycle.</description>

      <title>MixTTE: Multi-Level Mixture-of-Experts for Scalable and Adaptive Travel Time Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate Travel Time Estimation (TTE) is critical for ride-hailing platforms, where errors directly impact user experience and operational efficiency. While existing production systems excel at holistic route-level dependency modeling, they struggle to capture city-scale traffic dynamics and long-tail scenarios, leading to unreliable predictions in large urban networks. In this paper, we propose \model, a scalable and adaptive framework that synergistically integrates link-level modeling with industrial route-level TTE systems. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal external attention module to capture global traffic dynamic dependencies across million-scale road networks efficiently. Moreover, we construct a stabilized graph mixture-of-experts network to handle heterogeneous traffic patterns while maintaining inference efficiency. Furthermore, an asynchronous incremental learning strategy is tailored to enable real-time and stable adaptation to dynamic traffic distribution shifts. Experiments on real-world datasets validate MixTTE significantly reduces prediction errors compared to seven baselines. MixTTE has been deployed in DiDi, substantially improving the accuracy and stability of the TTE service.</description>

      <title>From Memorization to Creativity: LLM as a Designer of Novel Neural-Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in program synthesis, yet their ability to autonomously navigate neural architecture design--balancing syntactic reliability, performance, and structural novelty--remains underexplored. We address this by placing a code-oriented LLM within a closed-loop synthesis framework, analyzing its evolution over 22 supervised fine-tuning cycles. The model synthesizes PyTorch convolutional networks which are validated, evaluated via low-fidelity performance signals (single-epoch accuracy), and filtered using a MinHash-Jaccard criterion to prevent structural redundancy. High-performing, novel architectures are converted into prompt-code pairs for iterative fine-tuning via parameter-efficient LoRA adaptation, initialized from the LEMUR dataset. Across cycles, the LLM internalizes empirical architectural priors, becoming a robust generator. The valid generation rate stabilizes at 50.6 percent (peaking at 74.5 percent), while mean first-epoch accuracy rises from 28.06 percent to 50.99 percent, and the fraction of candidates exceeding 40 percent accuracy grows from 2.04 percent to 96.81 percent. Analyses confirm the model moves beyond replicating existing motifs, synthesizing 455 high-performing architectures absent from the original corpus. By grounding code synthesis in execution feedback, this work provides a scalable blueprint for transforming stochastic generators into autonomous, performance-driven neural designers, establishing that LLMs can internalize empirical, non-textual rewards to transcend their training data.</description>

      <title>Multi-Distribution Robust Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many fairness and distribution robustness problems, one has access to labeled data from multiple source distributions yet the test data may come from an arbitrary member or a mixture of them. We study the problem of constructing a conformal prediction set that is uniformly valid across multiple, heterogeneous distributions, in the sense that no matter which distribution the test point is from, the coverage of the prediction set is guaranteed to exceed a pre-specified level. We first propose a max-p aggregation scheme that delivers finite-sample, multi-distribution coverage given any conformity scores associated with each distribution. Upon studying several efficiency optimization programs subject to uniform coverage, we prove the optimality and tightness of our aggregation scheme, and propose a general algorithm to learn conformity scores that lead to efficient prediction sets after the aggregation under standard conditions. We discuss how our framework relates to group-wise distributionally robust optimization, sub-population shift, fairness, and multi-source learning. In synthetic and real-data experiments, our method delivers valid worst-case coverage across multiple distributions while greatly reducing the set size compared with naively applying max-p aggregation to single-source conformity scores, and can be comparable in size to single-source prediction sets with popular, standard conformity scores.</description>

      <title>In-Context Reinforcement Learning through Bayesian Fusion of Context and Value Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) promises fast adaptation to unseen environments without parameter updates, but current methods either cannot improve beyond the training distribution or require near-optimal data, limiting practical adoption. We introduce SPICE, a Bayesian ICRL method that learns a prior over Q-values via deep ensemble and updates this prior at test-time using in-context information through Bayesian updates. To recover from poor priors resulting from training on sub-optimal data, our online inference follows an Upper-Confidence Bound rule that favours exploration and adaptation. We prove that SPICE achieves regret-optimal behaviour in both stochastic bandits and finite-horizon MDPs, even when pretrained only on suboptimal trajectories. We validate these findings empirically across bandit and control benchmarks. SPICE achieves near-optimal decisions on unseen tasks, substantially reduces regret compared to prior ICRL and meta-RL approaches while rapidly adapting to unseen tasks and remaining robust under distribution shift.</description>

      <title>Causal Manifold Fairness: Enforcing Geometric Invariance in Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is increasingly critical, yet standard approaches often treat data as static points in a high-dimensional space, ignoring the underlying generative structure. We posit that sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender) do not merely shift data distributions but causally warp the geometry of the data manifold itself. To address this, we introduce Causal Manifold Fairness (CMF), a novel framework that bridges causal inference and geometric deep learning. CMF learns a latent representation where the local Riemannian geometry, defined by the metric tensor and curvature, remains invariant under counterfactual interventions on sensitive attributes. By enforcing constraints on the Jacobian and Hessian of the decoder, CMF ensures that the rules of the latent space (distances and shapes) are preserved across demographic groups. We validate CMF on synthetic Structural Causal Models (SCMs), demonstrating that it effectively disentangles sensitive geometric warping while preserving task utility, offering a rigorous quantification of the fairness-utility trade-off via geometric metrics.</description>

      <title>When the Coffee Feature Activates on Coffins: An Analysis of Feature Extraction and Steering for Mechanistic Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work by Anthropic on Mechanistic interpretability claims to understand and control Large Language Models by extracting human-interpretable features from their neural activation patterns using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). If successful, this approach offers one of the most promising routes for human oversight in AI safety. We conduct an initial stress-test of these claims by replicating their main results with open-source SAEs for Llama 3.1. While we successfully reproduce basic feature extraction and steering capabilities, our investigation suggests that major caution is warranted regarding the generalizability of these claims. We find that feature steering exhibits substantial fragility, with sensitivity to layer selection, steering magnitude, and context. We observe non-standard activation behavior and demonstrate the difficulty to distinguish thematically similar features from one another. While SAE-based interpretability produces compelling demonstrations in selected cases, current methods often fall short of the systematic reliability required for safety-critical applications. This suggests a necessary shift in focus from prioritizing interpretability of internal representations toward reliable prediction and control of model output. Our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of what mechanistic interpretability has achieved and highlights fundamental challenges for AI safety that remain unresolved.</description>

      <title>Joint Encoding of KV-Cache Blocks for Scalable LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) drive interactive AI systems but are bottlenecked by the memory-heavy growth of key-value (KV) caches, which limits real-time throughput under concurrent loads. Existing KV-cache compression methods rely on rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor layouts, or require specialized compute, hindering scalability and deployment.
  We propose joint encoding of KV-cache blocks, which fuses similar blocks across requests and input chunks into shared representations while preserving standard cache structure. This alleviates the KV-cache memory bottleneck, supporting high-concurrency serving without specialized hardware. Theoretically, we analyze the rate-distortion tradeoff of fused cache blocks under a Poisson process model. Empirically, our method achieves up to 4.38 $\times$ KV-cache compression with negligible accuracy loss across diverse LLMs and benchmarks, outperforming recent structured and adaptive compression baselines. In real LLM serving, joint encoding improves the token throughput by $\sim$40\% on a single-machine vLLM benchmark, demonstrating substantial gains in inference throughput. Code is available at https://github.com/sef1/kv_fast_fusion  kv_joint_encoding.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Adaptive Anomaly Detection in Industrial IoT Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To ensure reliability and service availability, next-generation networks are expected to rely on automated anomaly detection systems powered by advanced machine learning methods with the capability of handling multi-dimensional data. Such multi-dimensional, heterogeneous data occurs mostly in today's industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), where real-time detection of anomalies is critical to prevent impending failures and resolve them in a timely manner. However, existing anomaly detection methods often fall short of effectively coping with the complexity and dynamism of multi-dimensional data streams in IIoT. In this paper, we propose an adaptive method for detecting anomalies in IIoT streaming data utilizing a multi-source prediction model and concept drift adaptation. The proposed anomaly detection algorithm merges a prediction model into a novel drift adaptation method resulting in accurate and efficient anomaly detection that exhibits improved scalability. Our trace-driven evaluations indicate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods by achieving up to an 89.71% accuracy (in terms of Area under the Curve (AUC)) while meeting the given efficiency and scalability requirements.</description>

      <title>Audit Me If You Can: Query-Efficient Active Fairness Auditing of Black-Box LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit systematic biases across demographic groups. Auditing is proposed as an accountability tool for black-box LLM applications, but suffers from resource-intensive query access. We conceptualise auditing as uncertainty estimation over a target fairness metric and introduce BAFA, the Bounded Active Fairness Auditor for query-efficient auditing of black-box LLMs. BAFA maintains a version space of surrogate models consistent with queried scores and computes uncertainty intervals for fairness metrics (e.g., $\Delta$ AUC) via constrained empirical risk minimisation. Active query selection narrows these intervals to reduce estimation error. We evaluate BAFA on two standard fairness dataset case studies: \textsc{CivilComments} and \textsc{Bias-in-Bios}, comparing against stratified sampling, power sampling, and ablations. BAFA achieves target error thresholds with up to 40$\times$ fewer queries than stratified sampling (e.g., 144 vs 5,956 queries at $\varepsilon=0.02$ for \textsc{CivilComments}) for tight thresholds, demonstrates substantially better performance over time, and shows lower variance across runs. These results suggest that active sampling can reduce resources needed for independent fairness auditing with LLMs, supporting continuous model evaluations.</description>

      <title>ATLAS: Adaptive Test-Time Latent Steering with External Verifiers for Enhancing LLMs Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work on activation and latent steering has demonstrated that modifying internal representations can effectively guide large language models (LLMs) toward improved reasoning and efficiency without additional training. However, most existing approaches rely on fixed steering policies and static intervention strengths, which limit their robustness across problem instances and often result in over- or under-steering. We propose Adaptive Test-time Latent Steering, called (ATLAS), a task- specific framework that dynamically controls steering decisions at inference time using an external, lightweight latent verifier. Given intermediate hidden states, the verifier predicts the quality of ongoing reasoning and adaptively selects whether and how strongly to apply steering, enabling per-example and per-step adjustment with minimal overhead. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first method to integrate learned latent verification into test-time steering for enhancing LLMs reasoning. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that ATLAS consistently outperforms both vanilla decoding and fixed steering baselines, achieving higher accuracy while substantially reducing test-time token usage. These results demonstrate that verifier-guided latent adaptation provides an effective and scalable mechanism for controlling reasoning efficiency without sacrificing solution quality. All source code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>From Muscle to Text with MyoText: sEMG to Text via Finger Classification and Transformer-Based Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) provides a direct neural interface for decoding muscle activity and offers a promising foundation for keyboard-free text input in wearable and mixed-reality systems. Previous sEMG-to-text studies mainly focused on recognizing letters directly from sEMG signals, forming an important first step toward translating muscle activity into text. Building on this foundation, we present MyoText, a hierarchical framework that decodes sEMG signals to text through physiologically grounded intermediate stages. MyoText first classifies finger activations from multichannel sEMG using a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model, applies ergonomic typing priors to infer letters, and reconstructs full sentences with a fine-tuned T5 transformer. This modular design mirrors the natural hierarchy of typing, linking muscle intent to language output and reducing the search space for decoding. Evaluated on 30 users from the emg2qwerty dataset, MyoText outperforms baselines by achieving 85.4% finger-classification accuracy, 5.4% character error rate (CER), and 6.5% word error rate (WER). Beyond accuracy gains, this methodology establishes a principled pathway from neuromuscular signals to text, providing a blueprint for virtual and augmented-reality typing interfaces that operate entirely without physical keyboards. By integrating ergonomic structure with transformer-based linguistic reasoning, MyoText advances the feasibility of seamless, wearable neural input for future ubiquitous computing environments.</description>

      <title>Time-Aware Synthetic Control</title>

Abstract: The synthetic control (SC) framework is widely used for observational causal inference with time-series panel data. SC has been successful in diverse applications, but existing methods typically treat the ordering of pre-intervention time indices interchangeable. This invariance means they may not fully take advantage of temporal structure when strong trends are present. We propose Time-Aware Synthetic Control (TASC), which employs a state-space model with a constant trend while preserving a low-rank structure of the signal. TASC uses the Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother: it first fits a generative time-series model with expectation-maximization and then performs counterfactual inference. We evaluate TASC on both simulated and real-world datasets, including policy evaluation and sports prediction. Our results suggest that TASC offers advantages in settings with strong temporal trends and high levels of observation noise.</description>

      <title>One Sample to Rule Them All: Extreme Data Efficiency in RL Scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) can be unleashed with reinforcement learning (RL) (OpenAI, 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025a; Zeng et al., 2025). The success of existing RL attempts in LLMs usually relies on high-quality samples of thousands or beyond. In this paper, we challenge fundamental assumptions about data requirements in RL for LLMs by demonstrating the remarkable effectiveness of one-shot learning. Specifically, we introduce polymath learning, a framework for designing one training sample that elicits multidisciplinary impact. We present three key findings: (1) A single, strategically selected math reasoning sample can produce significant performance improvements across multiple domains, including physics, chemistry, and biology with RL; (2) The math skills salient to reasoning suggest the characteristics of the optimal polymath sample; and (3) An engineered synthetic sample that integrates multidiscipline elements outperforms training with individual samples that naturally occur. Our approach achieves superior performance to training with larger datasets across various reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that sample quality and design, rather than quantity, may be the key to unlock enhanced reasoning capabilities in language models. Our results suggest a shift, dubbed as sample engineering, toward precision engineering of training samples rather than simply increasing data volume.</description>

      <title>PersonaLedger: Generating Realistic Financial Transactions with Persona Conditioned LLMs and Rule Grounded Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strict privacy regulations limit access to real transaction data, slowing open research in financial AI. Synthetic data can bridge this gap, but existing generators do not jointly achieve behavioral diversity and logical groundedness. Rule-driven simulators rely on hand-crafted workflows and shallow stochasticity, which miss the richness of human behavior. Learning-based generators such as GANs capture correlations yet often violate hard financial constraints and still require training on private data. We introduce PersonaLedger, a generation engine that uses a large language model conditioned on rich user personas to produce diverse transaction streams, coupled with an expert configurable programmatic engine that maintains correctness. The LLM and engine interact in a closed loop: after each event, the engine updates the user state, enforces financial rules, and returns a context aware "nextprompt" that guides the LLM toward feasible next actions. With this engine, we create a public dataset of 30 million transactions from 23,000 users and a benchmark suite with two tasks, illiquidity classification and identity theft segmentation. PersonaLedger offers a realistic, privacy preserving resource that supports rigorous evaluation of forecasting and anomaly detection models. PersonaLedger offers the community a rich, realistic, and privacy preserving resource -- complete with code, rules, and generation logs -- to accelerate innovation in financial AI and enable rigorous, reproducible evaluation.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Counterfactual Explanations for Generative AI System Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generative AI systems become integrated into real-world applications, organizations increasingly need to be able to understand and interpret their behavior. In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -the prompt- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability.</description>

      <title>Rapid Augmentations for Time Series (RATS): A High-Performance Library for Time Series Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series augmentation is critical for training robust deep learning models, particularly in domains where labelled data is scarce and expensive to obtain. However, existing augmentation libraries for time series, mainly written in Python, suffer from performance bottlenecks, where running time grows exponentially as dataset sizes increase -- an aspect limiting their applicability in large-scale, production-grade systems. We introduce RATS (Rapid Augmentations for Time Series), a high-performance library for time series augmentation written in Rust with Python bindings (RATSpy). RATS implements multiple augmentation methods spanning basic transformations, frequency-domain operations and time warping techniques, all accessible through a unified pipeline interface with built-in parallelisation. Comprehensive benchmarking of RATSpy versus a commonly used library (tasug) on 143 datasets demonstrates that RATSpy achieves an average speedup of 74.5\% over tsaug (up to 94.8\% on large datasets), with up to 47.9\% less peak memory usage.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence Behavior of Preconditioned Gradient Descent Toward the Rich Learning Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low frequencies first, can be both a blessing and a curse. While it enhances the generalization capabilities by suppressing high-frequency noise, it can be a limitation in scientific tasks that require capturing fine-scale structures. The delayed generalization phenomenon known as grokking is another barrier to rapid training of neural networks. Grokking has been hypothesized to arise as learning transitions from the NTK to the feature-rich regime. This paper explores the impact of preconditioned gradient descent (PGD), such as Gauss-Newton, on spectral bias and grokking phenomena. We demonstrate through theoretical and empirical results how PGD can mitigate issues associated with spectral bias. Additionally, building on the rich learning regime grokking hypothesis, we study how PGD can be used to reduce delays associated with grokking. Our conjecture is that PGD, without the impediment of spectral bias, enables uniform exploration of the parameter space in the NTK regime. Our experimental results confirm this prediction, providing strong evidence that grokking represents a transitional behavior between the lazy regime characterized by the NTK and the rich regime. These findings deepen our understanding of the interplay between optimization dynamics, spectral bias, and the phases of neural network learning.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Hyperparameter Importance for Efficient Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Choosing a suitable ML model is a complex task that can depend on several objectives, e.g., accuracy, model size, fairness, inference time, or energy consumption. In practice, this requires trading off multiple, often competing, objectives through multi-objective optimization (MOO). However, existing MOO methods typically treat all hyperparameters as equally important, overlooking that hyperparameter importance (HPI) can vary significantly depending on the trade-off between objectives. We propose a novel dynamic optimization approach that prioritizes the most influential hyperparameters based on varying objective trade-offs during the search process, which accelerates empirical convergence and leads to better solutions. Building on prior work on HPI for MOO post-analysis, we now integrate HPI, calculated with HyperSHAP, into the optimization. For this, we leverage the objective weightings naturally produced by the MOO algorithm ParEGO and adapt the configuration space by fixing the unimportant hyperparameters, allowing the search to focus on the important ones. Eventually, we validate our method with diverse tasks from PyMOO and YAHPO-Gym. Empirical results demonstrate improvements in convergence speed and Pareto front quality compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>Predicting Time Pressure of Powered Two-Wheeler Riders for Proactive Safety Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time pressure critically influences risky maneuvers and crash proneness among powered two-wheeler riders, yet its prediction remains underexplored in intelligent transportation systems. We present a large-scale dataset of 129,000+ labeled multivariate time-series sequences from 153 rides by 51 participants under No, Low, and High Time Pressure conditions. Each sequence captures 63 features spanning vehicle kinematics, control inputs, behavioral violations, and environmental context. Our empirical analysis shows High Time Pressure induces 48% higher speeds, 36.4% greater speed variability, 58% more risky turns at intersections, 36% more sudden braking, and 50% higher rear brake forces versus No Time Pressure. To benchmark this dataset, we propose MotoTimePressure, a deep learning model combining convolutional preprocessing, dual-stage temporal attention, and Squeeze-and-Excitation feature recalibration, achieving 91.53% accuracy and 98.93% ROC AUC, outperforming eight baselines. Since time pressure cannot be directly measured in real time, we demonstrate its utility in collision prediction and threshold determination. Using MTPS-predicted time pressure as features, improves Informer-based collision risk accuracy from 91.25% to 93.51%, approaching oracle performance (93.72%). Thresholded time pressure states capture rider cognitive stress and enable proactive ITS interventions, including adaptive alerts, haptic feedback, V2I signaling, and speed guidance, supporting safer two-wheeler mobility under the Safe System Approach.</description>

Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of decentralization of autoregressive generation. We define the Decentralized Discrete Flow Matching objective, by expressing probability generating velocity as a linear combination of expert flows. We also conduct experiments demonstrat- ing the equivalence between decentralized and centralized training settings for multimodal language models across diverse set of benchmarks. Specifically, we compare two distinct paradigms: LLaVA and InternVL 2.5-1B, which uses a fixed CLIP vision encoder and per- forms full-parameter fine-tuning (ViT+MLP+LLM) during the instruction tuning stage.</description>

      <title>Sparse Knowledge Distillation: A Mathematical Framework for Probability-Domain Temperature Scaling and Multi-Stage Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified theoretical framework for sparse knowledge distillation based on probability-domain softening operators. While the equivalence $p^{1/T} \propto \mathrm{softmax}(z/T)$ is well known, our contribution is an operator-level analytical framework built on this foundation rather than the equivalence itself.
  The framework comprises four core components: (i) operator-agnostic bias--variance decompositions that characterize when sparse students outperform dense teachers, (ii) a homotopy path formalization of multi-stage pruning in function space explaining why iterative compression succeeds where one-shot pruning fails, (iii) convergence guarantees establishing $O(1/n)$ rates for $n$-stage distillation with explicit parameter dependence, and (iv) equivalence class characterizations identifying distinct probability-domain operators that yield identical student models under capacity constraints.
  We introduce an axiomatic definition of probability-domain softening operators based on ranking preservation, continuity, entropy monotonicity, identity, and boundary behavior, and show that multiple non-equivalent operator families satisfy these axioms. All learning-theoretic guarantees are shown to hold uniformly across this operator class, independent of implementation details. These results provide theoretical grounding for black-box teacher distillation, partial-access settings such as top-$k$ truncation and text-only outputs, and privacy-preserving model compression.</description>

      <title>Empowering Reliable Visual-Centric Instruction Following in MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating the instruction-following (IF) capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for rigorously assessing how faithfully model outputs adhere to user-specified intentions. Nevertheless, existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs' instruction-following capability primarily focus on verbal instructions in the textual modality. These limitations hinder a thorough analysis of instruction-following capabilities, as they overlook the implicit constraints embedded in the semantically rich visual modality. To address this gap, we introduce VC-IFEval, a new benchmark accompanied by a systematically constructed dataset that evaluates MLLMs' instruction-following ability under multimodal settings. Our benchmark systematically incorporates vision-dependent constraints into instruction design, enabling a more rigorous and fine-grained assessment of how well MLLMs align their outputs with both visual input and textual instructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning MLLMs on our dataset, we achieve substantial gains in visual instruction-following accuracy and adherence. Through extensive evaluation across representative MLLMs, we provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of current models.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Fairness with Graph Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating machine learning (ML) model bias is key to building trustworthy and robust ML systems. Counterfactual Fairness (CF) audits allow the measurement of bias of ML models with a causal framework, yet their conclusions rely on a single causal graph that is rarely known with certainty in real-world scenarios. We propose CF with Graph Uncertainty (CF-GU), a bias evaluation procedure that incorporates the uncertainty of specifying a causal graph into CF. CF-GU (i) bootstraps a Causal Discovery algorithm under domain knowledge constraints to produce a bag of plausible Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), (ii) quantifies graph uncertainty with the normalized Shannon entropy, and (iii) provides confidence bounds on CF metrics. Experiments on synthetic data show how contrasting domain knowledge assumptions support or refute audits of CF, while experiments on real-world data (COMPAS and Adult datasets) pinpoint well-known biases with high confidence, even when supplied with minimal domain knowledge constraints.</description>

      <title>Critic-Guided Reinforcement Unlearning in Text-to-Image Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models aims to remove targeted concepts while preserving overall utility. Prior diffusion unlearning methods typically rely on supervised weight edits or global penalties; reinforcement-learning (RL) approaches, while flexible, often optimize sparse end-of-trajectory rewards, yielding high-variance updates and weak credit assignment. We present a general RL framework for diffusion unlearning that treats denoising as a sequential decision process and introduces a timestep-aware critic with noisy-step rewards. Concretely, we train a CLIP-based reward predictor on noisy latents and use its per-step signal to compute advantage estimates for policy-gradient updates of the reverse diffusion kernel. Our algorithm is simple to implement, supports off-policy reuse, and plugs into standard text-to-image backbones. Across multiple concepts, the method achieves better or comparable forgetting to strong baselines while maintaining image quality and benign prompt fidelity; ablations show that (i) per-step critics and (ii) noisy-conditioned rewards are key to stability and effectiveness. We release code and evaluation scripts to facilitate reproducibility and future research on RL-based diffusion unlearning.</description>

      <title>From Entropy to Epiplexity: Rethinking Information for Computationally Bounded Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can we learn more from data than existed in the generating process itself? Can new and useful information be constructed from merely applying deterministic transformations to existing data? Can the learnable content in data be evaluated without considering a downstream task? On these questions, Shannon information and Kolmogorov complexity come up nearly empty-handed, in part because they assume observers with unlimited computational capacity and fail to target the useful information content. In this work, we identify and exemplify three seeming paradoxes in information theory: (1) information cannot be increased by deterministic transformations; (2) information is independent of the order of data; (3) likelihood modeling is merely distribution matching. To shed light on the tension between these results and modern practice, and to quantify the value of data, we introduce epiplexity, a formalization of information capturing what computationally bounded observers can learn from data. Epiplexity captures the structural content in data while excluding time-bounded entropy, the random unpredictable content exemplified by pseudorandom number generators and chaotic dynamical systems. With these concepts, we demonstrate how information can be created with computation, how it depends on the ordering of the data, and how likelihood modeling can produce more complex programs than present in the data generating process itself. We also present practical procedures to estimate epiplexity which we show capture differences across data sources, track with downstream performance, and highlight dataset interventions that improve out-of-distribution generalization. In contrast to principles of model selection, epiplexity provides a theoretical foundation for data selection, guiding how to select, generate, or transform data for learning systems.</description>

      <title>PET-TURTLE: Deep Unsupervised Support Vector Machines for Imbalanced Data Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation vision, audio, and language models enable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks via their latent representations. Recently, unsupervised learning of data group structure with deep learning methods has gained popularity. TURTLE, a state of the art deep clustering algorithm, uncovers data labeling without supervision by alternating label and hyperplane updates, maximizing the hyperplane margin, in a similar fashion to support vector machines (SVMs). However, TURTLE assumes clusters are balanced; when data is imbalanced, it yields non-ideal hyperplanes that cause higher clustering error. We propose PET-TURTLE, which generalizes the cost function to handle imbalanced data distributions by a power law prior. Additionally, by introducing sparse logits in the labeling process, PET-TURTLE optimizes a simpler search space that in turn improves accuracy for balanced datasets. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that PET-TURTLE improves accuracy for imbalanced sources, prevents over-prediction of minority clusters, and enhances overall clustering.</description>

      <title>FUSE : Failure-aware Usage of Subagent Evidence for MultiModal Search and Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal creative assistants decompose user goals and route tasks to subagents for layout, styling, retrieval, and generation. Retrieval quality is pivotal, yet failures can arise at several stages: understanding user intent, choosing content types, finding candidates (recall), or ranking results. Meanwhile, sending and processing images is costly, making naive multimodal approaches impractical. We present FUSE: Failure-aware Usage of Subagent Evidence for MultiModal Search and Recommendation. FUSE replaces most raw-image prompting with a compact Grounded Design Representation (GDR): a selection aware JSON of canvas elements (image, text, shape, icon, video, logo), structure, styles, salient colors, and user selection provided by the Planner team. FUSE implements seven context budgeting strategies: comprehensive baseline prompting, context compression, chain-of-thought reasoning, mini-shot optimization, retrieval-augmented context, two-stage processing, and zero-shot minimalism. Finally, a pipeline attribution layer monitors system performance by converting subagent signals into simple checks: intent alignment, content-type/routing sanity, recall health (e.g., zero-hit and top-match strength), and ranking displacement analysis. We evaluate the seven context budgeting variants across 788 evaluation queries from diverse users and design templates (refer Figure 3). Our systematic evaluation reveals that Context Compression achieves optimal performance across all pipeline stages, with 93.3% intent accuracy, 86.8% routing success(with fallbacks), 99.4% recall, and 88.5% NDCG@5. This approach demonstrates that strategic context summarization outperforms both comprehensive and minimal contextualization strategies.</description>

      <title>Cross-Platform Digital Discourse Analysis of the Israel-Hamas Conflict: Sentiment, Topics, and Event Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains one of the most polarizing geopolitical issues, with the October 2023 escalation intensifying online debate. Social media platforms, particularly Telegram, have become central to real-time news sharing, advocacy, and propaganda. In this study, we analyze Telegram, Twitter/X, and Reddit to examine how conflict narratives are produced, amplified, and contested across different digital spheres. Building on our previous work on Telegram discourse during the 2023 escalation, we extend the analysis longitudinally and cross-platform using an updated dataset spanning October 2023 to mid-2025. The corpus includes more than 187,000 Telegram messages, 2.1 million Reddit comments, and curated Twitter/X posts. We combine Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), BERTopic, and transformer-based sentiment and emotion models to identify dominant themes, emotional dynamics, and propaganda strategies. Telegram channels provide unfiltered, high-intensity documentation of events; Twitter/X amplifies frames to global audiences; and Reddit hosts more reflective and deliberative discussions. Our findings reveal persistent negative sentiment, strong coupling between humanitarian framing and solidarity expressions, and platform-specific pathways for the diffusion of pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli narratives. This paper offers three contributions: (1) a multi-platform, FAIR-compliant dataset on the Israel-Hamas war, (2) an integrated pipeline combining topic modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, and spam filtering for large-scale conflict discourse, and (3) empirical insights into how platform affordances and affective publics shape the evolution of digital conflict communication.</description>

      <title>How to Discover Knowledge for FutureG: Contextual RAG and LLM Prompting for O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a retrieval-augmented question answering framework for 5G/6G networks, where the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has become central to disaggregated, virtualized, and AI-driven wireless systems. While O-RAN enables multi-vendor interoperability and cloud-native deployments, its fast-changing specifications and interfaces pose major challenges for researchers and practitioners. Manual navigation of these complex documents is labor-intensive and error-prone, slowing system design, integration, and deployment. To address this challenge, we adopt Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Contextual RAG), a strategy in which candidate answer choices guide document retrieval and chunk-specific context to improve large language model (LLM) performance. This improvement over traditional RAG achieves more targeted and context-aware retrieval, which improves the relevance of documents passed to the LLM, particularly when the query alone lacks sufficient context for accurate grounding. Our framework is designed for dynamic domains where data evolves rapidly and models must be continuously updated or redeployed, all without requiring LLM fine-tuning. We evaluate this framework using the ORANBenchmark-13K dataset, and compare three LLMs, namely, Llama3.2, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen3.0-4B, across both Direct Question Answering (Direct Q&amp;A) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies. We show that Contextual RAG consistently improves accuracy over standard RAG and base prompting, while maintaining competitive runtime and CO2 emissions. These results highlight the potential of Contextual RAG to serve as a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific Q&amp;A in ORAN and broader 5G/6G environments, enabling more accurate interpretation of evolving standards while preserving efficiency and sustainability.</description>

      <title>Spiking Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world graphs or networks are usually heterogeneous, involving multiple types of nodes and relationships. Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) can effectively handle these diverse nodes and edges, capturing heterogeneous information within the graph, thus exhibiting outstanding performance. However, most methods of HGNNs usually involve complex structural designs, leading to problems such as high memory usage, long inference time, and extensive consumption of computing resources. These limitations pose certain challenges for the practical application of HGNNs, especially for resource-constrained devices. To mitigate this issue, we propose the Spiking Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks (SpikingHAN), which incorporates the brain-inspired and energy-saving properties of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) into heterogeneous graph learning to reduce the computing cost without compromising the performance. Specifically, SpikingHAN aggregates metapath-based neighbor information using a single-layer graph convolution with shared parameters. It then employs a semantic-level attention mechanism to capture the importance of different meta-paths and performs semantic aggregation. Finally, it encodes the heterogeneous information into a spike sequence through SNNs, simulating bioinformatic processing to derive a binarized 1-bit representation of the heterogeneous graph. Comprehensive experimental results from three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets show that SpikingHAN delivers competitive node classification performance. It achieves this with fewer parameters, quicker inference, reduced memory usage, and lower energy consumption. Code is available at https://github.com/QianPeng369/SpikingHAN.</description>

      <title>SpikySpace: A Spiking State Space Model for Energy-Efficient Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-series forecasting often operates under tight power and latency budgets in fields like traffic management, industrial condition monitoring, and on-device sensing. These applications frequently require near real-time responses and low energy consumption on edge devices. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer event-driven computation and ultra-low power by exploiting temporal sparsity and multiplication-free computation. Yet existing SNN-based time-series forecasters often inherit complex transformer blocks, thereby losing much of the efficiency benefit. To solve the problem, we propose SpikySpace, a spiking state-space model (SSM) that reduces the quadratic cost in the attention block to linear time via selective scanning. Further, we replace dense SSM updates with sparse spike trains and execute selective scans only on spike events, thereby avoiding dense multiplications while preserving the SSM's structured memory. Because complex operations such as exponentials and divisions are costly on neuromorphic chips, we introduce simplified approximations of SiLU and Softplus to enable a neuromorphic-friendly model architecture. In matched settings, SpikySpace reduces estimated energy consumption by 98.73% and 96.24% compared to two state-of-the-art transformer based approaches, namely iTransformer and iSpikformer, respectively. In standard time series forecasting datasets, SpikySpace delivers competitive accuracy while substantially reducing energy cost and memory traffic. As the first full spiking state-space model, SpikySpace bridges neuromorphic efficiency with modern sequence modeling, marking a practical and scalable path toward efficient time series forecasting systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce NitroGen, a vision-action foundation model for generalist gaming agents that is trained on 40,000 hours of gameplay videos across more than 1,000 games. We incorporate three key ingredients: 1) an internet-scale video-action dataset constructed by automatically extracting player actions from publicly available gameplay videos, 2) a multi-game benchmark environment that can measure cross-game generalization, and 3) a unified vision-action model trained with large-scale behavior cloning. NitroGen exhibits strong competence across diverse domains, including combat encounters in 3D action games, high-precision control in 2D platformers, and exploration in procedurally generated worlds. It transfers effectively to unseen games, achieving up to 52% relative improvement in task success rates over models trained from scratch. We release the dataset, evaluation suite, and model weights to advance research on generalist embodied agents.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Quanvolutional Neural Networks Robustness for Speech in Healthcare Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech-based machine learning systems are sensitive to noise, complicating reliable deployment in emotion recognition and voice pathology detection. We evaluate the robustness of a hybrid quantum machine learning model, quanvolutional neural networks (QNNs) against classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under four acoustic corruptions (Gaussian noise, pitch shift, temporal shift, and speed variation) in a clean-train/corrupted-test regime. Using AVFAD (voice pathology) and TESS (speech emotion), we compare three QNN models (Random, Basic, Strongly) to a simple CNN baseline (CNN-Base), ResNet-18 and VGG-16 using accuracy and corruption metrics (CE, mCE, RCE, RmCE), and analyze architectural factors (circuit complexity or depth, convergence) alongside per-emotion robustness. QNNs generally outperform the CNN-Base under pitch shift, temporal shift, and speed variation (up to 22% lower CE/RCE at severe temporal shift), while the CNN-Base remains more resilient to Gaussian noise. Among quantum circuits, QNN-Basic achieves the best overall robustness on AVFAD, and QNN-Random performs strongest on TESS. Emotion-wise, fear is most robust (80-90% accuracy under severe corruptions), neutral can collapse under strong Gaussian noise (5.5% accuracy), and happy is most vulnerable to pitch, temporal, and speed distortions. QNNs also converge up to six times faster than the CNN-Base. To our knowledge, this is a systematic study of QNN robustness for speech under common non-adversarial acoustic corruptions, indicating that shallow entangling quantum front-ends can improve noise resilience while sensitivity to additive noise remains a challenge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Deep learning superresolution (SR) may enhance musculoskeletal MR image quality, but its diagnostic value in knee imaging at 7T is unclear. Objectives: To compare image quality and diagnostic performance of SR, low-resolution (LR), and high-resolution (HR) 7T knee MRI. Methods: In this prospective study, 42 participants underwent 7T knee MRI with LR (0.8*0.8*2 mm3) and HR (0.4*0.4*2 mm3) sequences. SR images were generated from LR data using a Hybrid Attention Transformer model. Three radiologists assessed image quality, anatomic conspicuity, and detection of knee pathologies. Arthroscopy served as reference in 10 cases. Results: SR images showed higher overall quality than LR (median score 5 vs 4, P&lt;.001) and lower noise than HR (5 vs 4, P&lt;.001). Visibility of cartilage, menisci, and ligaments was superior in SR and HR compared to LR (P&lt;.001). Detection rates and diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, AUC) for intra-articular pathology were similar across image types (P&gt;=.095). Conclusions: Deep learning superresolution improved subjective image quality in 7T knee MRI but did not increase diagnostic accuracy compared with standard LR imaging.</description>

      <title>TAP-ViTs: Task-Adaptive Pruning for On-Device Deployment of Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of vision tasks, yet their substantial computational and memory demands hinder efficient deployment on resource-constrained mobile and edge devices. Pruning has emerged as a promising direction for reducing ViT complexity. However, existing approaches either (i) produce a single pruned model shared across all devices, ignoring device heterogeneity, or (ii) rely on fine-tuning with device-local data, which is often infeasible due to limited on-device resources and strict privacy constraints. As a result, current methods fall short of enabling task-customized ViT pruning in privacy-preserving mobile computing settings. This paper introduces TAP-ViTs, a novel task-adaptive pruning framework that generates device-specific pruned ViT models without requiring access to any raw local data. Specifically, to infer device-level task characteristics under privacy constraints, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based metric dataset construction mechanism. Each device fits a lightweight GMM to approximate its private data distribution and uploads only the GMM parameters. Using these parameters, the cloud selects distribution-consistent samples from public data to construct a task-representative metric dataset for each device. Based on this proxy dataset, we further develop a dual-granularity importance evaluation-based pruning strategy that jointly measures composite neuron importance and adaptive layer importance, enabling fine-grained, task-aware pruning tailored to each device's computational budget. Extensive experiments across multiple ViT backbones and datasets demonstrate that TAP-ViTs consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods under comparable compression ratios.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Long-Tailed Anomaly Score Distributions with Importance-Weighted Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection is crucial in industrial applications for identifying rare and unseen patterns to ensure system reliability. Traditional models, trained on a single class of normal data, struggle with real-world distributions where normal data exhibit diverse patterns, leading to class imbalance and long-tailed anomaly score distributions (LTD). This imbalance skews model training and degrades detection performance, especially for minority instances. To address this issue, we propose a novel importance-weighted loss designed specifically for anomaly detection. Compared to the previous method for LTD in classification, our method does not require prior knowledge of normal data classes. Instead, we introduce a weighted loss function that incorporates importance sampling to align the distribution of anomaly scores with a target Gaussian, ensuring a balanced representation of normal data. Extensive experiments on three benchmark image datasets and three real-world hyperspectral imaging datasets demonstrate the robustness of our approach in mitigating LTD-induced bias. Our method improves anomaly detection performance by 0.043, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>VocalBridge: Latent Diffusion-Bridge Purification for Defeating Perturbation-Based Voiceprint Defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech synthesis technologies, including text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC), has intensified security and privacy concerns related to voice cloning. Recent defenses attempt to prevent unauthorized cloning by embedding protective perturbations into speech to obscure speaker identity while maintaining intelligibility. However, adversaries can apply advanced purification techniques to remove these perturbations, recover authentic acoustic characteristics, and regenerate cloneable voices. Despite the growing realism of such attacks, the robustness of existing defenses under adaptive purification remains insufficiently studied.
  Most existing purification methods are designed to counter adversarial noise in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems rather than speaker verification or voice cloning pipelines. As a result, they fail to suppress the fine-grained acoustic cues that define speaker identity and are often ineffective against speaker verification attacks (SVA). To address these limitations, we propose Diffusion-Bridge (VocalBridge), a purification framework that learns a latent mapping from perturbed to clean speech in the EnCodec latent space. Using a time-conditioned 1D U-Net with a cosine noise schedule, the model enables efficient, transcript-free purification while preserving speaker-discriminative structure. We further introduce a Whisper-guided phoneme variant that incorporates lightweight temporal guidance without requiring ground-truth transcripts. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms existing purification methods in recovering cloneable voices from protected speech. Our findings demonstrate the fragility of current perturbation-based defenses and highlight the need for more robust protection mechanisms against evolving voice-cloning and speaker verification threats.</description>

      <title>A Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Approach For High-Resolution Gridded Monsoon Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) is a critical climate phenomenon, fundamentally impacting the agriculture, economy, and water security of over a billion people. Traditional long-range forecasting, whether statistical or dynamical, has predominantly focused on predicting a single, spatially-averaged seasonal value, lacking the spatial detail essential for regional-level resource management. To address this gap, we introduce a novel deep learning framework that reframes gridded monsoon prediction as a spatio-temporal computer vision task. We treat multi-variable, pre-monsoon atmospheric and oceanic fields as a sequence of multi-channel images, effectively creating a video-like input tensor. Using 85 years of ERA5 reanalysis data for predictors and IMD rainfall data for targets, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture to learn the complex mapping from the five-month pre-monsoon period (January-May) to a high-resolution gridded rainfall pattern for the subsequent monsoon season. Our framework successfully produces distinct forecasts for each of the four monsoon months (June-September) as well as the total seasonal average, demonstrating its utility for both intra-seasonal and seasonal outlooks.</description>

      <title>Variational (Energy-Based) Spectral Learning: A Machine Learning Framework for Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce variational spectral learning (VSL), a machine learning framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) that operates directly in the coefficient space of spectral expansions. VSL offers a principled bridge between variational PDE theory, spectral discretization, and contemporary machine learning practice. The core idea is to recast a given PDE \[ \mathcal{L}u = f \quad \text{in} \quad Q=\Omega\times(0,T), \] together with boundary and initial conditions, into differentiable space--time energies built from strong-form least-squares residuals and weak (Galerkin) formulations. The solution is represented as a finite spectral expansion \[ u_N(x,t)=\sum_{n=1}^{N} c_n\,\phi_n(x,t), \] where $\phi_n$ are tensor-product Chebyshev bases in space and time, with Dirichlet-satisfying spatial modes enforcing homogeneous boundary conditions analytically. This yields a compact linear parameterization in the coefficient vector $\mathbf{c}$, while all PDE complexity is absorbed into the variational energy. We show how to construct strong-form and weak-form space-time functionals, augment them with initial-condition and Tikhonov regularization terms, and minimize the resulting objective with gradient-based optimization. In practice, VSL is implemented in TensorFlow using automatic differentiation and Keras cosine-decay-with-restarts learning-rate schedules, enabling robust optimization of moderately sized coefficient vectors. Numerical experiments on benchmark elliptic and parabolic problems, including one- and two-dimensional Poisson, diffusion, and Burgers-type equations, demonstrate that VSL attains accuracy comparable to classical spectral collocation with Crank-Nicolson time stepping, while providing a differentiable objective suitable for modern optimization tooling.</description>

      <title>First Provably Optimal Asynchronous SGD for Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly through large neural networks trained on massive datasets using thousands of GPUs or TPUs. Such training can occupy entire data centers for weeks and requires enormous computational and energy resources. Yet the optimization algorithms behind these runs have not kept pace. Most large scale training still relies on synchronous methods, where workers must wait for the slowest device, wasting compute and amplifying the effects of hardware and network variability. Removing synchronization seems like a simple fix, but asynchrony introduces staleness, meaning updates computed on outdated models. This makes analysis difficult, especially when delays arise from system level randomness rather than algorithmic choices. As a result, the time complexity of asynchronous methods remains poorly understood. This dissertation develops a rigorous framework for asynchronous first order stochastic optimization, focusing on the core challenge of heterogeneous worker speeds. Within this framework, we show that with proper design, asynchronous SGD can achieve optimal time complexity, matching guarantees previously known only for synchronous methods. Our first contribution, Ringmaster ASGD, attains optimal time complexity in the homogeneous data setting by selectively discarding stale updates. The second, Ringleader ASGD, extends optimality to heterogeneous data, common in federated learning, using a structured gradient table mechanism. Finally, ATA improves resource efficiency by learning worker compute time distributions and allocating tasks adaptively, achieving near optimal wall clock time with less computation. Together, these results establish asynchronous optimization as a theoretically sound and practically efficient foundation for distributed learning, showing that coordination without synchronization can be both feasible and optimal.</description>

      <title>Compressed code: the hidden effects of quantization and distillation on programming tokens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional code generation capabilities, yet their token-level mechanisms remain underexplored, particularly in compressed models. Through systematic analysis of programming language token representations, we characterize how programming languages are encoded in LLM tokenizers by analyzing their vocabulary distribution and keyword coverage patterns. We introduce a novel cold-start probability analysis method that provides insights into model behavior without requiring explicit prompts. Additionally, we present a comprehensive evaluation of how different model optimization techniques - including quantization, distillation, model scaling, and task-specific fine-tuning - affect token-level representations and code generation quality. Our experiments, supported by comprehensive probability distribution analysis and evaluation metrics, reveal critical insights into token-level behavior and provide empirically-validated guidelines for maintaining code generation quality under various optimization constraints. These findings advance both theoretical understanding of LLM code generation and practical implementation of optimized models in production environments.</description>

      <title>SWaRL: Safeguard Code Watermarking via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SWaRL, a robust and fidelity-preserving watermarking framework designed to protect the intellectual property of code LLM owners by embedding unique and verifiable signatures in the generated output. Existing approaches rely on manually crafted transformation rules to preserve watermarked code functionality or manipulate token-generation probabilities at inference time, which are prone to compilation errors. To address these challenges, SWaRL employs a reinforcement learning-based co-training framework that uses compiler feedback for functional correctness and a jointly trained confidential verifier as a reward signal to maintain watermark detectability. Furthermore, SWaRL employs low-rank adaptation (LoRA) during fine-tuning, allowing the learned watermark information to be transferable across model updates. Extensive experiments show that SWaRL achieves higher watermark detection accuracy compared to prior methods while fully maintaining watermarked code functionality. The LoRA-based signature embedding steers the base model to generate and solve code in a watermark-specific manner without significant computational overhead. Moreover, SWaRL exhibits strong resilience against refactoring and adversarial transformation attacks.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical temporal receptive windows and zero-shot timescale generalization in biologically constrained scale-invariant deep networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human cognition integrates information across nested timescales. While the cortex exhibits hierarchical Temporal Receptive Windows (TRWs), local circuits often display heterogeneous time constants. To reconcile this, we trained biologically constrained deep networks, based on scale-invariant hippocampal time cells, on a language classification task mimicking the hierarchical structure of language (e.g., 'letters' forming 'words'). First, using a feedforward model (SITHCon), we found that a hierarchy of TRWs emerged naturally across layers, despite the network having an identical spectrum of time constants within layers. We then distilled these inductive priors into a biologically plausible recurrent architecture, SITH-RNN. Training a sequence of architectures ranging from generic RNNs to this restricted subset showed that the scale-invariant SITH-RNN learned faster with orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters, and generalized zero-shot to out-of-distribution timescales. These results suggest the brain employs scale-invariant, sequential priors - coding "what" happened "when" - making recurrent networks with such priors particularly well-suited to describe human cognition.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Fuzzy Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering is a central tool in biomedical research for discovering heterogeneous patient subpopulations, where group boundaries are often diffuse rather than sharply separated. Traditional methods produce hard partitions, whereas soft clustering methods such as fuzzy $c$-means (FCM) allow mixed memberships and better capture uncertainty and gradual transitions. Despite the widespread use of FCM, principled statistical inference for fuzzy clustering remains limited.
  We develop a new framework for weighted fuzzy $c$-means (WFCM) for settings with potential cluster size imbalance. Cluster-specific weights rebalance the classical FCM criterion so that smaller clusters are not overwhelmed by dominant groups, and the weighted objective induces a normalized density model with scale parameter $\sigma$ and fuzziness parameter $m$. Estimation is performed via a blockwise majorize--minimize (MM) procedure that alternates closed-form membership and centroid updates with likelihood-based updates of $(\sigma,\bw)$. The intractable normalizing constant is approximated by importance sampling using a data-adaptive Gaussian mixture proposal. We further provide likelihood ratio tests for comparing cluster centers and bootstrap-based confidence intervals.
  We establish consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator, validate the method through simulations, and illustrate it using single-cell RNA-seq and Alzheimer disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data. These applications demonstrate stable uncertainty quantification and biologically meaningful soft memberships, ranging from well-separated cell populations under imbalance to a graded AD versus non-AD continuum consistent with disease progression.</description>

      <title>Empirical Comparison of Encoder-Based Language Models and Feature-Based Supervised Machine Learning Approaches to Automated Scoring of Long Essays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long context may impose challenges for encoder-only language models in text processing, specifically for automated scoring of essays. This study trained several commonly used encoder-based language models for automated scoring of long essays. The performance of these trained models was evaluated and compared with the ensemble models built upon the base language models with a token limit of 512?. The experimented models include BERT-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and DeBERTa), ensemble models integrating embeddings from multiple encoder models, and ensemble models of feature-based supervised machine learning models, including Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine. We trained, validated, and tested each model on a dataset of 17,307 essays, with an 80%/10%/10% split, and evaluated model performance using Quadratic Weighted Kappa. This study revealed that an ensemble-of-embeddings model that combines multiple pre-trained language model representations with gradient-boosting classifier as the ensemble model significantly outperforms individual language models at scoring long essays.</description>

      <title>Extracting books from production language models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many unresolved legal questions over LLMs and copyright center on memorization: whether specific training data have been encoded in the model's weights during training, and whether those memorized data can be extracted in the model's outputs. While many believe that LLMs do not memorize much of their training data, recent work shows that substantial amounts of copyrighted text can be extracted from open-weight models. However, it remains an open question if similar extraction is feasible for production LLMs, given the safety measures these systems implement. We investigate this question using a two-phase procedure: (1) an initial probe to test for extraction feasibility, which sometimes uses a Best-of-N (BoN) jailbreak, followed by (2) iterative continuation prompts to attempt to extract the book. We evaluate our procedure on four production LLMs -- Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok 3 -- and we measure extraction success with a score computed from a block-based approximation of longest common substring (nv-recall). With different per-LLM experimental configurations, we were able to extract varying amounts of text. For the Phase 1 probe, it was unnecessary to jailbreak Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok 3 to extract text (e.g, nv-recall of 76.8% and 70.3%, respectively, for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone), while it was necessary for Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4.1. In some cases, jailbroken Claude 3.7 Sonnet outputs entire books near-verbatim (e.g., nv-recall=95.8%). GPT-4.1 requires significantly more BoN attempts (e.g., 20X), and eventually refuses to continue (e.g., nv-recall=4.0%). Taken together, our work highlights that, even with model- and system-level safeguards, extraction of (in-copyright) training data remains a risk for production LLMs.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Contrastive Learning for LLM Quantization Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model quantization is critical for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained hardware, yet recent work has revealed severe security risks that benign LLMs in full precision may exhibit malicious behaviors after quantization. In this paper, we propose Adversarial Contrastive Learning (ACL), a novel gradient-based quantization attack that achieves superior attack effectiveness by explicitly maximizing the gap between benign and harmful responses probabilities. ACL formulates the attack objective as a triplet-based contrastive loss, and integrates it with a projected gradient descent two-stage distributed fine-tuning strategy to ensure stable and efficient optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate ACL's remarkable effectiveness, achieving attack success rates of 86.00% for over-refusal, 97.69% for jailbreak, and 92.40% for advertisement injection, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 44.67%, 18.84%, and 50.80%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Which Deep Learner? A Systematic Evaluation of Advanced Deep Forecasting Models Accuracy and Efficiency for Network Traffic Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network traffic prediction is essential for automating modern network management. It is a difficult time series forecasting (TSF) problem that has been addressed by Deep Learning (DL) models due to their ability to capture complex patterns. Advances in forecasting, from sophisticated transformer architectures to simple linear models, have improved performance across diverse prediction tasks. However, given the variability of network traffic across network environments and traffic series timescales, it is essential to identify effective deployment choices and modeling directions for network traffic prediction. This study systematically identify and evaluates twelve advanced TSF models -including transformer-based and traditional DL approaches, each with unique advantages for network traffic prediction- against three statistical baselines on four real traffic datasets, across multiple time scales and horizons, assessing performance, robustness to anomalies, data gaps, external factors, data efficiency, and resource efficiency in terms of time, memory, and energy. Results highlight performance regimes, efficiency thresholds, and promising architectures that balance accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating robustness to traffic challenges and suggesting new directions beyond traditional RNNs.</description>

      <title>Fast Conformal Prediction using Conditional Interquantile Intervals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Conformal Interquantile Regression (CIR), a conformal regression method that efficiently constructs near-minimal prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage. CIR leverages black-box machine learning models to estimate outcome distributions through interquantile ranges, transforming these estimates into compact prediction intervals while achieving approximate conditional coverage. We further propose CIR+ (Conditional Interquantile Regression with More Comparison), which enhances CIR by incorporating a width-based selection rule for interquantile intervals. This refinement yields narrower prediction intervals while maintaining comparable coverage, though at the cost of slightly increased computational time. Both methods address key limitations of existing distributional conformal prediction approaches: they handle skewed distributions more effectively than Conformalized Quantile Regression, and they achieve substantially higher computational efficiency than Conformal Histogram Regression by eliminating the need for histogram construction. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods optimally balance predictive accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>COFFEE: COdesign Framework for Feature Enriched Embeddings in Ads-Ranking Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diverse and enriched data sources are essential for commercial ads-recommendation models to accurately assess user interest both before and after engagement with content. While extended user-engagement histories can improve the prediction of user interests, it is equally important to embed activity sequences from multiple sources to ensure freshness of user and ad-representations, following scaling law principles. In this paper, we present a novel three-dimensional framework for enhancing user-ad representations without increasing model inference or serving complexity. The first dimension examines the impact of incorporating diverse event sources, the second considers the benefits of longer user histories, and the third focuses on enriching data with additional event attributes and multi-modal embeddings. We assess the return on investment (ROI) of our source enrichment framework by comparing organic user engagement sources, such as content viewing, with ad-impression sources. The proposed method can boost the area under curve (AUC) and the slope of scaling curves for ad-impression sources by 1.56 to 2 times compared to organic usage sources even for short online-sequence lengths of 100 to 10K. Additionally, click-through rate (CTR) prediction improves by 0.56% AUC over the baseline production ad-recommendation system when using enriched ad-impression event sources, leading to improved sequence scaling resolutions for longer and offline user-ad representations.</description>

      <title>HAL: Inducing Human-likeness in LLMs with Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational human-likeness plays a central role in human-AI interaction, yet it has remained difficult to define, measure, and optimize. As a result, improvements in human-like behavior are largely driven by scale or broad supervised training, rather than targeted alignment. We introduce Human Aligning LLMs (HAL), a framework for aligning language models to conversational human-likeness using an interpretable, data-driven reward. HAL derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this score as a transparent reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods. Using this approach, we align models of varying sizes without affecting their overall performance. In large-scale human evaluations, models aligned with HAL are more frequently perceived as human-like in conversation. Because HAL operates over explicit, interpretable traits, it enables inspection of alignment behavior and diagnosis of unintended effects. More broadly, HAL demonstrates how soft, qualitative properties of language--previously outside the scope for alignment--can be made measurable and aligned in an interpretable and explainable way.</description>

      <title>STIPP: Space-time in situ postprocessing over the French Alps using proper scoring rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Space-time in situ postprocessing (STIPP), a machine learning model that generates spatio-temporally consistent weather forecasts for a network of station locations. Gridded forecasts from classical numerical weather prediction or data-driven models often lack the necessary precision due to unresolved local effects. Typical statistical postprocessing methods correct these biases, but often degrade spatio-temporal correlation structures in doing so. Recent works based on generative modeling successfully improve spatial correlation structures but have to forecast every lead time independently. In contrast, STIPP makes joint spatio-temporal forecasts which have increased accuracy for surface temperature, wind, relative humidity and precipitation when compared to baseline methods. It makes hourly ensemble predictions given only a six-hourly deterministic forecast, blending the boundaries of postprocessing and temporal interpolation. By leveraging a multivariate proper scoring rule for training, STIPP contributes to ongoing work data-driven atmospheric models supervised only with distribution marginals.</description>

      <title>Enhanced 3D Gravity Inversion Using ResU-Net with Density Logging Constraints: A Dual-Phase Training Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravity exploration has become an important geophysical method due to its low cost and high efficiency. With the rise of artificial intelligence, data-driven gravity inversion methods based on deep learning (DL) possess physical property recovery capabilities that conventional regularization methods lack. However, existing DL methods suffer from insufficient prior information constraints, which leads to inversion models with large data fitting errors and unreliable results. Moreover, the inversion results lack constraints and matching from other exploration methods, leading to results that may contradict known geological conditions. In this study, we propose a novel approach that integrates prior density well logging information to address the above issues. First, we introduce a depth weighting function to the neural network (NN) and train it in the weighted density parameter domain. The NN, under the constraint of the weighted forward operator, demonstrates improved inversion performance, with the resulting inversion model exhibiting smaller data fitting errors. Next, we divide the entire network training into two phases: first training a large pre-trained network Net-I, and then using the density logging information as the constraint to get the optimized fine-tuning network Net-II. Through testing and comparison in synthetic models and Bishop Model, the inversion quality of our method has significantly improved compared to the unconstrained data-driven DL inversion method. Additionally, we also conduct a comparison and discussion between our method and both the conventional focusing inversion (FI) method and its well logging constrained variant. Finally, we apply this method to the measured data from the San Nicolas mining area in Mexico, comparing and analyzing it with two recent gravity inversion methods based on DL.</description>

      <title>TA-Prompting: Enhancing Video Large Language Models for Dense Video Captioning via Temporal Anchors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to interpret and describe all temporally localized events throughout an input video. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide detailed moment descriptions for video data. However, existing VideoLLMs remain challenging in identifying precise event boundaries in untrimmed videos, causing the generated captions to be not properly grounded. In this paper, we propose TA-Prompting, which enhances VideoLLMs via Temporal Anchors that learn to precisely localize events and prompt the VideoLLMs to perform temporal-aware video event understanding. During inference, in order to properly determine the output caption sequence from an arbitrary number of events presented within a video, we introduce an event coherent sampling strategy to select event captions with sufficient coherence across temporal events and cross-modal similarity with the given video. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that our TA-Prompting is favorable against state-of-the-art VideoLLMs, yielding superior performance on dense video captioning and temporal understanding tasks including moment retrieval and temporalQA.</description>

      <title>Image, Word and Thought: A More Challenging Language Task for the Iterated Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The iterated learning model simulates the transmission of language from generation to generation in order to explore how the constraints imposed by language transmission facilitate the emergence of language structure. Despite each modelled language learner starting from a blank slate, the presence of a bottleneck limiting the number of utterances to which the learner is exposed can lead to the emergence of language that lacks ambiguity, is governed by grammatical rules, and is consistent over successive generations, that is, one that is expressive, compositional and stable. The recent introduction of a more computationally tractable and ecologically valid semi supervised iterated learning model, combining supervised and unsupervised learning within an autoencoder architecture, has enabled exploration of language transmission dynamics for much larger meaning-signal spaces. Here, for the first time, the model has been successfully applied to a language learning task involving the communication of much more complex meanings: seven-segment display images. Agents in this model are able to learn and transmit a language that is expressive: distinct codes are employed for all 128 glyphs; compositional: signal components consistently map to meaning components, and stable: the language does not change from generation to generation.</description>

      <title>Low-Resource Heuristics for Bahnaric Optical Character Recognition Improvement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bahnar, a minority language spoken across Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, faces significant preservation challenges due to limited research and data availability. This study addresses the critical need for accurate digitization of Bahnar language documents through optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Digitizing scanned paper documents poses significant challenges, as degraded image quality from broken or blurred areas introduces considerable OCR errors that compromise information retrieval systems. We propose a comprehensive approach combining advanced table and non-table detection techniques with probability-based post-processing heuristics to enhance recognition accuracy. Our method first applies detection algorithms to improve input data quality, then employs probabilistic error correction on OCR output. Experimental results indicate a substantial improvement, with recognition accuracy increasing from 72.86% to 79.26%. This work contributes valuable resources for Bahnar language preservation and provides a framework applicable to other minority language digitization efforts.</description>

      <title>Reliability-Aware Adaptive Self-Consistency for Efficient Sampling in LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-Consistency improves reasoning reliability through multi-sample aggregation, but incurs substantial inference cost. Adaptive self-consistency methods mitigate this issue by adjusting the sampling budget; however, they rely on count-based stopping rules that treat all responses equally, often leading to unnecessary sampling. We propose Reliability-Aware Adaptive Self-Consistency (ReASC), which addresses this limitation by reframing adaptive sampling from response counting to evidence sufficiency, leveraging response-level confidence for principled information aggregation. ReASC operates in two stages: a single-sample decision stage that resolves instances confidently answerable from a single response, and a reliability-aware accumulation stage that aggregates responses by jointly leveraging their frequency and confidence. Across five models and four datasets, ReASC consistently achieves the best accuracy-cost trade-off compared to existing baselines, yielding improved inference efficiency across model scales from 3B to 27B parameters. As a concrete example, ReASC reduces inference cost by up to 70\% relative to self-consistency while preserving accuracy on GSM8K using Gemma-3-4B-it.</description>

      <title>Learning to Act Robustly with View-Invariant Latent Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-based robotic policies often struggle with even minor viewpoint changes, underscoring the need for view-invariant visual representations. This challenge becomes more pronounced in real-world settings, where viewpoint variability is unavoidable and can significantly disrupt policy performance. Existing methods typically learn invariance from multi-view observations at the scene level, but such approaches rely on visual appearance and fail to incorporate the physical dynamics essential for robust generalization. We propose View-Invariant Latent Action (VILA), which models a latent action capturing transition patterns across trajectories to learn view-invariant representations grounded in physical dynamics. VILA aligns these latent actions across viewpoints using an action-guided objective based on ground-truth action sequences. Experiments in both simulation and the real world show that VILA-based policies generalize effectively to unseen viewpoints and transfer well to new tasks, establishing VILA as a strong pretraining framework that improves robustness and downstream learning performance.</description>

      <title>Dementia-R1: Reinforced Pretraining and Reasoning from Unstructured Clinical Notes for Real-World Dementia Prognosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on clinical text understanding, they struggle with longitudinal prediction tasks such as dementia prognosis, which require reasoning over complex, non-monotonic symptom trajectories across multiple visits. Standard supervised training lacks explicit annotations for symptom evolution, while direct Reinforcement Learning (RL) is hindered by sparse binary rewards. To address this challenge, we introduce Dementia-R1, an RL-based framework for longitudinal dementia prognosis from unstructured clinical notes. Our approach adopts a Cold-Start RL strategy that pre-trains the model to predict verifiable clinical indices extracted from patient histories, enhancing the capability to reason about disease progression before determining the final clinical status. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dementia-R1 achieves an F1 score of 77.03% on real-world unstructured clinical datasets. Notably, on the ADNI benchmark, our 7B model rivals GPT-4o, effectively capturing fluctuating cognitive trajectories.

      <title>Flow Matching and Diffusion Models via PointNet for Generating Fluid Fields on Irregular Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two novel generative geometric deep learning frameworks, termed Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet, for predicting fluid flow variables on irregular geometries by incorporating PointNet into flow matching and diffusion models, respectively. In these frameworks, a reverse generative process reconstructs physical fields from standard Gaussian noise conditioned on unseen geometries. The proposed approaches operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains (e.g., grid vertices of finite-volume meshes) and therefore avoid the limitations of pixelation used to project geometries onto uniform lattices. In contrast to graph neural network-based diffusion models, Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet do not exhibit high-frequency noise artifacts in the predicted fields. Moreover, unlike such approaches, which require auxiliary intermediate networks to condition geometry, the proposed frameworks rely solely on PointNet, resulting in a simple and unified architecture. The performance of the proposed frameworks is evaluated on steady incompressible flow past a cylinder, using a geometric dataset constructed by varying the cylinder's cross-sectional shape and orientation across samples. The results demonstrate that Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet achieve more accurate predictions of velocity and pressure fields, as well as lift and drag forces, and exhibit greater robustness to incomplete geometries compared to a vanilla PointNet with the same number of trainable parameters.</description>

      <title>PiDR: Physics-Informed Inertial Dead Reckoning for Autonomous Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental requirement for full autonomy is the ability to sustain accurate navigation in the absence of external data, such as GNSS signals or visual information. In these challenging environments, the platform must rely exclusively on inertial sensors, leading to pure inertial navigation. However, the inherent noise and other error terms of the inertial sensors in such real-world scenarios will cause the navigation solution to drift over time. Although conventional deep-learning models have emerged as a possible approach to inertial navigation, they are inherently black-box in nature. Furthermore, they struggle to learn effectively with limited supervised sensor data and often fail to preserve physical principles. To address these limitations, we propose PiDR, a physics-informed inertial dead-reckoning framework for autonomous platforms in situations of pure inertial navigation. PiDR offers transparency by explicitly integrating inertial navigation principles into the network training process through the physics-informed residual component. PiDR plays a crucial role in mitigating abrupt trajectory deviations even under limited or sparse supervision. We evaluated PiDR on real-world datasets collected by a mobile robot and an autonomous underwater vehicle. We obtained more than 29% positioning improvement in both datasets, demonstrating the ability of PiDR to generalize different platforms operating in various environments and dynamics. Thus, PiDR offers a robust, lightweight, yet effective architecture and can be deployed on resource-constrained platforms, enabling real-time pure inertial navigation in adverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Lil: Less is Less When Applying Post-Training Sparse-Attention Algorithms in Long-Decode Stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities across a wide range of complex tasks and are increasingly deployed at scale, placing significant demands on inference efficiency. Prior work typically decomposes inference into prefill and decode stages, with the decode stage dominating total latency. To reduce time and memory complexity in the decode stage, a line of work introduces sparse-attention algorithms. In this paper, we show, both empirically and theoretically, that sparse attention can paradoxically increase end-to-end complexity: information loss often induces significantly longer sequences, a phenomenon we term ``Less is Less'' (Lil). To mitigate the Lil problem, we propose an early-stopping algorithm that detects the threshold where information loss exceeds information gain during sparse decoding. Our early-stopping algorithm reduces token consumption by up to 90% with a marginal accuracy degradation of less than 2% across reasoning-intensive benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Temporal Graph Network: Hallucination Detection in Multi-Turn Conversation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hallucinations can be produced by conversational AI systems, particularly in multi-turn conversations where context changes and contradictions may eventually surface. By representing the entire conversation as a temporal graph, we present a novel graph-based method for detecting dialogue-level hallucinations. Our framework models each dialogue as a node, encoding it using a sentence transformer. We explore two different ways of connectivity: i) shared-entity edges, which connect turns that refer to the same entities; ii) temporal edges, which connect contiguous turns in the conversation. Message-passing is used to update the node embeddings, allowing flow of information between related nodes. The context-aware node embeddings are then combined using attention pooling into a single vector, which is then passed on to a classifier to determine the presence and type of hallucinations. We demonstrate that our method offers slightly improved performance over existing methods. Further, we show the attention mechanism can be used to justify the decision making process. The code and model weights are made available at: https://github.com/sambuaneesh/anlp-project.</description>

      <title>Explainable Fuzzy GNNs for Leak Detection in Water Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timely leak detection in water distribution networks is critical for conserving resources and maintaining operational efficiency. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at capturing spatial-temporal dependencies in sensor data, their black-box nature and the limited work on graph-based explainable models for water networks hinder practical adoption. We propose an explainable GNN framework that integrates mutual information to identify critical network regions and fuzzy logic to provide clear, rule-based explanations for node classification tasks. After benchmarking several GNN architectures, we selected the generalized graph convolution network (GENConv) for its superior performance and developed a fuzzy-enhanced variant that offers intuitive explanations for classified leak locations. Our fuzzy graph neural network (FGENConv) achieved Graph F1 scores of 0.889 for detection and 0.814 for localization, slightly below the crisp GENConv 0.938 and 0.858, respectively. Yet it compensates by providing spatially localized, fuzzy rule-based explanations. By striking the right balance between precision and explainability, the proposed fuzzy network could enable hydraulic engineers to validate predicted leak locations, conserve human resources, and optimize maintenance strategies. The code is available at github.com/pasqualedem/GNNLeakDetection.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs Encode Functional Importance of Reasoning Tokens?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models solve complex tasks by generating long reasoning chains, achieving higher accuracy at the cost of increased computational cost and reduced ability to isolate functionally relevant reasoning. Prior work on compact reasoning shortens such chains through probabilistic sampling, heuristics, or supervision from frontier models, but offers limited insight into whether models internally encode token-level functional importance for answer generation. We address this gap diagnostically and propose greedy pruning, a likelihood-preserving deletion procedure that iteratively removes reasoning tokens whose removal minimally degrades model likelihood under a specified objective, yielding length-controlled reasoning chains. We evaluate pruned reasoning in a distillation framework and show that students trained on pruned chains outperform a frontier-model-supervised compression baseline at matched reasoning lengths. Finally, our analysis reveals systematic pruning patterns and shows that attention scores can predict greedy pruning ranks, further suggesting that models encode a nontrivial functional importance structure over reasoning tokens.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet their black-box nature raises concerns about transparency and faithfulness. Input attribution methods aim to highlight each input token's contributions to the model's output, but existing approaches are typically model-agnostic, and do not focus on transformer-specific architectures, leading to limited faithfulness. To address this, we propose Grad-ELLM, a gradient-based attribution method for decoder-only transformer-based LLMs. By aggregating channel importance from gradients of the output logit with respect to attention layers and spatial importance from attention maps, Grad-ELLM generates heatmaps at each generation step without requiring architectural modifications. Additionally, we introduce two faithfulneses metrics $\pi$-Soft-NC and $\pi$-Soft-NS, which are modifications of Soft-NC/NS that provide fairer comparisons by controlling the amount of information kept when perturbing the text. We evaluate Grad-ELLM on sentiment classification, question answering, and open-generation tasks using different models. Experiment results show that Grad-ELLM consistently achieves superior faithfulness than other attribution methods.</description>

      <title>ToxiGAN: Toxic Data Augmentation via LLM-Guided Directional Adversarial Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Augmenting toxic language data in a controllable and class-specific manner is crucial for improving robustness in toxicity classification, yet remains challenging due to limited supervision and distributional skew. We propose ToxiGAN, a class-aware text augmentation framework that combines adversarial generation with semantic guidance from large language models (LLMs). To address common issues in GAN-based augmentation such as mode collapse and semantic drift, ToxiGAN introduces a two-step directional training strategy and leverages LLM-generated neutral texts as semantic ballast. Unlike prior work that treats LLMs as static generators, our approach dynamically selects neutral exemplars to provide balanced guidance. Toxic samples are explicitly optimized to diverge from these exemplars, reinforcing class-specific contrastive signals. Experiments on four hate speech benchmarks show that ToxiGAN achieves the strongest average performance in both macro-F1 and hate-F1, consistently outperforming traditional and LLM-based augmentation methods. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further confirm the benefits of semantic ballast and directional training in enhancing classifier robustness.</description>

      <title>Gradient descent reliably finds depth- and gate-optimal circuits for generic unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the gate set has continuous parameters, synthesizing a unitary operator as a quantum circuit is always possible using exact methods, but finding minimal circuits efficiently remains a challenging problem. The landscape is very different for compiled unitaries, which arise from programming and typically have short circuits, as compared with generic unitaries, which use all parameters and typically require circuits of maximal size. We show that simple gradient descent reliably finds depth- and gate-optimal circuits for generic unitaries, including in the presence of restricted chip connectivity. This runs counter to earlier evidence that optimal synthesis required combinatorial search, and we show that this discrepancy can be explained by avoiding the random selection of certain parameter-deficient circuit skeletons.</description>

      <title>LeafLife: An Explainable Deep Learning Framework with Robustness for Grape Leaf Disease Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plant disease diagnosis is essential to farmers' management choices because plant diseases frequently lower crop yield and product quality. For harvests to flourish and agricultural productivity to boost, grape leaf disease detection is important. The plant disease dataset contains grape leaf diseases total of 9,032 images of four classes, among them three classes are leaf diseases, and the other one is healthy leaves. After rigorous pre-processing dataset was split (70% training, 20% validation, 10% testing), and two pre-trained models were deployed: InceptionV3 and Xception. Xception shows a promising result of 96.23% accuracy, which is remarkable than InceptionV3. Adversarial Training is used for robustness, along with more transparency. Grad-CAM is integrated to confirm the leaf disease. Finally deployed a web application using Streamlit with a heatmap visualization and prediction with confidence level for robust grape leaf disease classification.</description>

      <title>Finite Memory Belief Approximation for Optimal Control in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study finite memory belief approximation for partially observable (PO) stochastic optimal control (SOC) problems. While belief states are sufficient for SOC in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), they are generally infinite-dimensional and impractical. We interpret truncated input-output (IO) histories as inducing a belief approximation and develop a metric-based theory that directly relates information loss to control performance. Using the Wasserstein metric, we derive policy-conditional performance bounds that quantify value degradation induced by finite memory along typical closed-loop trajectories. Our analysis proceeds via a fixed-policy comparison: we evaluate two cost functionals under the same closed-loop execution and isolate the effect of replacing the true belief by its finite memory approximation inside the belief-level cost. For linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) systems, we provide closed-form belief mismatch evaluation and empirically validate the predicted mechanism, demonstrating that belief mismatch decays approximately exponentially with memory length and that the induced performance mismatch scales accordingly. Together, these results provide a metric-aware characterization of what finite memory belief approximation can and cannot achieve in PO settings.</description>

      <title>Can Embedding Similarity Predict Cross-Lingual Transfer? A Systematic Study on African Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-lingual transfer is essential for building NLP systems for low-resource African languages, but practitioners lack reliable methods for selecting source languages. We systematically evaluate five embedding similarity metrics across 816 transfer experiments spanning three NLP tasks, three African-centric multilingual models, and 12 languages from four language families. We find that cosine gap and retrieval-based metrics (P@1, CSLS) reliably predict transfer success ($\rho = 0.4-0.6$), while CKA shows negligible predictive power ($\rho \approx 0.1$). Critically, correlation signs reverse when pooling across models (Simpson's Paradox), so practitioners must validate per-model. Embedding metrics achieve comparable predictive power to URIEL linguistic typology. Our results provide concrete guidance for source language selection and highlight the importance of model-specific analysis.</description>

      <title>AnatomiX, an Anatomy-Aware Grounded Multimodal Large Language Model for Chest X-Ray Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal medical large language models have shown impressive progress in chest X-ray interpretation but continue to face challenges in spatial reasoning and anatomical understanding. Although existing grounding techniques improve overall performance, they often fail to establish a true anatomical correspondence, resulting in incorrect anatomical understanding in the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce AnatomiX, a multitask multimodal large language model explicitly designed for anatomically grounded chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by the radiological workflow, AnatomiX adopts a two stage approach: first, it identifies anatomical structures and extracts their features, and then leverages a large language model to perform diverse downstream tasks such as phrase grounding, report generation, visual question answering, and image understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AnatomiX achieves superior anatomical reasoning and delivers over 25% improvement in performance on anatomy grounding, phrase grounding, grounded diagnosis and grounded captioning tasks compared to existing approaches.

      <description>arXiv:2601.03235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has long promised transformative advances in data analysis, yet practical quantum machine learning has remained elusive due to fundamental obstacles such as a steep quantum cost for the loading of classical data and poor trainability of many quantum machine learning algorithms designed for near-term quantum hardware. In this work, we show that one can overcome these obstacles by using a linear Hamiltonian-based machine learning method which provides a compact quantum representation of classical data via ground state problems for k-local Hamiltonians. We use the recent sample-based Krylov quantum diagonalization method to compute low-energy states of the data Hamiltonians, whose parameters are trained to express classical datasets through local gradients. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of the methods by performing experiments on benchmark datasets using up to 50 qubits of an IBM Heron quantum processor.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning from Noisy and Incomplete Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many important problems in science and engineering involve inferring a signal from noisy and/or incomplete observations, where the observation process is known. Historically, this problem has been tackled using hand-crafted regularization (e.g., sparsity, total-variation) to obtain meaningful estimates. Recent data-driven methods often offer better solutions by directly learning a solver from examples of ground-truth signals and associated observations. However, in many real-world applications, obtaining ground-truth references for training is expensive or impossible. Self-supervised learning methods offer a promising alternative by learning a solver from measurement data alone, bypassing the need for ground-truth references. This manuscript provides a comprehensive summary of different self-supervised methods for inverse problems, with a special emphasis on their theoretical underpinnings, and presents practical applications in imaging inverse problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel optimization problem formulation that departs from the conventional way of minimizing machine learning model loss as a black-box function. Unlike traditional formulations, the proposed approach explicitly incorporates an initially pre-trained model and random sketch operators, allowing for sparsification of both the model and gradient during training. We establish the insightful properties of the proposed objective function and highlight its connections to the standard formulation. Furthermore, we present several variants of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method adapted to the new problem formulation, including SGD with general sampling, a distributed version, and SGD with variance reduction techniques. We achieve tighter convergence rates and relax assumptions, bridging the gap between theoretical principles and practical applications, covering several important techniques such as Dropout and Sparse training. This work presents promising opportunities to enhance the theoretical understanding of model training through a sparsification-aware optimization approach.</description>

      <title>Time-Transformer: Integrating Local and Global Features for Better Time Series Generation (Extended Version)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11714v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating time series data is a promising approach to address data deficiency problems. However, it is also challenging due to the complex temporal properties of time series data, including local correlations as well as global dependencies. Most existing generative models have failed to effectively learn both the local and global properties of time series data. To address this open problem, we propose a novel time series generative model named 'Time-Transformer AAE', which consists of an adversarial autoencoder (AAE) and a newly designed architecture named 'Time-Transformer' within the decoder. The Time-Transformer first simultaneously learns local and global features in a layer-wise parallel design, combining the abilities of Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformer in extracting local features and global dependencies respectively. Second, a bidirectional cross attention is proposed to provide complementary guidance across the two branches and achieve proper fusion between local and global features. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can outperform existing state-of-the-art models in 5 out of 6 datasets, specifically on those with data containing both global and local properties. Furthermore, we highlight our model's advantage on handling this kind of data via an artificial dataset. Finally, we show our model's ability to address a real-world problem: data augmentation to support learning with small datasets and imbalanced datasets.</description>

      <title>A Large-Scale Analysis on the Use of Arrival Time Prediction for Automated Shuttle Services in the Real World</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban mobility is on the cusp of transformation with the emergence of shared, connected, and cooperative automated vehicles. Yet, for them to be accepted by customers, trust in their punctuality is vital. Many pilot initiatives operate without a fixed schedule, enhancing the importance of reliable arrival time (AT) predictions. This study presents an AT prediction system for automated shuttles, utilizing separate models for dwell and running time predictions, validated on real-world data from six cities. Alongside established methods such as XGBoost, we explore the benefits of leveraging spatial correlations using graph neural networks (GNN). To accurately handle the case of a shuttle bypassing a stop, we propose a hierarchical model combining a random forest classifier and a GNN. The results for the final AT prediction are promising, showing low errors even when predicting several stops ahead. Yet, no single model emerges as universally superior, and we provide insights into the characteristics of pilot sites that influence the model selection process and prediction performance. Finally, we identify dwell time prediction as the key determinant in overall AT prediction accuracy when automated shuttles are deployed in low-traffic areas or under regulatory speed limits. Our meta-analysis across six pilot sites in different cities provides insights into the current state of autonomous public transport prediction models and paves the way for more data-informed decision-making as the field advances.</description>

      <title>Empowering Source-Free Domain Adaptation via MLLM-Guided Reliability-Based Curriculum Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing SFDA methods struggle to fully use pre-trained knowledge and often rely on a single model's predictions or handcrafted prompts, limiting robustness under domain shift. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative: they encode rich visual-semantic knowledge and generalize well without task-specific tuning. However, their use in SFDA is hindered by instruction-following failures, inconsistent outputs, and high inference costs. We propose Reliability-based Curriculum Learning (RCL), a novel framework that distills robust supervision from multiple frozen MLLMs into a compact target model. RCL organizes adaptation as a three-stage curriculum that progressively incorporates pseudo-labels based on inter-model agreement and model confidence, enabling stable and noise-aware training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard SFDA datasets, Office-Home, DomainNet-126, and VisDA-C, outperforming zero-shot MLLMs, their ensembles, all without accessing source data or tuning foundation models. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Dong-Jie-Chen/RCL.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction for Dose-Response Models with Continuous Treatments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the dose-response relation between a continuous treatment and the outcome for an individual can greatly drive decision-making, particularly in areas like personalized drug dosing and personalized healthcare interventions. Point estimates are often insufficient in these high-risk environments, highlighting the need for uncertainty quantification to support informed decisions. Conformal prediction, a distribution-free and model-agnostic method for uncertainty quantification, has seen limited application in continuous treatments or dose-response models. To address this gap, we propose a novel methodology that frames the causal dose-response problem as a covariate shift, leveraging weighted conformal prediction. By incorporating propensity estimation, conformal predictive systems, and likelihood ratios, we present a practical solution for generating prediction intervals for dose-response models. Additionally, our method approximates local coverage for every treatment value by applying kernel functions as weights in weighted conformal prediction. Finally, we use a new synthetic benchmark dataset to demonstrate the significance of covariate shift assumptions in achieving robust prediction intervals for dose-response models.</description>

      <title>Limits to scalable evaluation at the frontier: LLM as Judge won't beat twice the data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High quality annotations are increasingly a bottleneck in the explosively growing machine learning ecosystem. Scalable evaluation methods that avoid costly annotation have therefore become an important research ambition. Many hope to use strong existing models in lieu of costly labels to provide cheap model evaluations. Unfortunately, this method of using models as judges introduces biases, such as self-preferencing, that can distort model comparisons. An emerging family of debiasing tools promises to fix these issues by using a few high quality labels to debias a large number of model judgments. In this paper, we study how far such debiasing methods, in principle, can go. Our main result shows that when the judge is no more accurate than the evaluated model, no debiasing method can decrease the required amount of ground truth labels by more than half. Our result speaks to the severe limitations of the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm at the evaluation frontier where the goal is to assess newly released models that are possibly better than the judge. Through an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the sample size savings achievable in practice are even more modest than what our theoretical limit suggests. Along the way, our work provides new observations about debiasing methods for model evaluation, and points out promising avenues for future work.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have pushed the frontier of artificial intelligence but are comprised of hundreds of billions of parameters and operations. For faster inference latency, LLMs are deployed on multiple hardware accelerators through various Model Parallelism strategies. Our paper looks into the details on one such strategy - Tensor Parallel - and proposes to reduce latency by compressing inter-accelerator communication. We leverage fine grained quantization techniques to compress selected activations by 3.5 - 4.5x. Our proposed method leads up to 2x reduction of time-to-first-token (TTFT) with negligible model performance degradation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are overshadowed by their immense computational cost. While recent work has shown that many LLM layers can be reordered or even removed with minimal impact on accuracy, these insights have not been translated into significant inference speedups. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel method that restructures the computational graph by grouping and evaluating consecutive layer pairs in parallel. This approach, requiring no retraining, yields a 1.19x throughput gain on Llama 2 7B while reducing the average benchmark accuracy by only 1.5\%. We demonstrate the practical value of this method for large-scale LLM deployment and show that some of the lost accuracy can be recovered with lightweight fine-tuning of the parallelized layers.</description>

      <title>Training Set Reconstruction from Differentially Private Forests: How Effective is DP?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05307v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that structured machine learning models such as tree ensembles are vulnerable to privacy attacks targeting their training data. To mitigate these risks, differential privacy (DP) has become a widely adopted countermeasure, as it offers rigorous privacy protection. In this paper, we introduce a reconstruction attack targeting state-of-the-art $\epsilon$-DP random forests. By leveraging a constraint programming model that incorporates knowledge of the forest's structure and DP mechanism characteristics, our approach formally reconstructs the most likely dataset that could have produced a given forest. Through extensive computational experiments, we examine the interplay between model utility, privacy guarantees and reconstruction accuracy across various configurations. Our results reveal that random forests trained with meaningful DP guarantees can still leak portions of their training data. Specifically, while DP reduces the success of reconstruction attacks, the only forests fully robust to our attack exhibit predictive performance no better than a constant classifier. Building on these insights, we also provide practical recommendations for the construction of DP random forests that are more resilient to reconstruction attacks while maintaining a non-trivial predictive performance.</description>

      <title>Active operator learning with predictive uncertainty quantification for partial differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increased prevalence of neural operators being used to provide rapid solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), understanding the accuracy of model predictions and the associated error levels is necessary for deploying reliable surrogate models in scientific applications. Existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) frameworks employ ensembles or Bayesian methods, which can incur substantial computational costs during both training and inference. We propose a lightweight predictive UQ method tailored for Deep operator networks (DeepONets) that also generalizes to other operator networks. Numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear PDEs demonstrate that the framework's uncertainty estimates are unbiased and provide accurate out-of-distribution uncertainty predictions with a sufficiently large training dataset. Our framework provides fast inference and uncertainty estimates that can efficiently drive outer-loop analyses that would be prohibitively expensive with conventional solvers. We demonstrate how predictive uncertainties can be used in the context of Bayesian optimization and active learning problems to yield improvements in accuracy and data-efficiency for outer-loop optimization procedures. In the active learning setup, we extend the framework to Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and describe a generalized method for other operator networks. To enable real-time deployment, we introduce an inference strategy based on precomputed trunk outputs and a sparse placement matrix, reducing evaluation time by more than a factor of five. Our method provides a practical route to uncertainty-aware operator learning in time-sensitive settings.</description>

      <title>The MASK Benchmark: Disentangling Honesty From Accuracy in AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and agentic, the requirement for trust in their outputs grows significantly, yet at the same time concerns have been mounting that models may learn to lie in pursuit of their goals. To address these concerns, a body of work has emerged around the notion of "honesty" in LLMs, along with interventions aimed at mitigating deceptive behaviors. However, some benchmarks claiming to measure honesty in fact simply measure accuracy--the correctness of a model's beliefs--in disguise. Moreover, no benchmarks currently exist for directly measuring whether language models lie. In this work, we introduce a large-scale human-collected dataset for directly measuring lying, allowing us to disentangle accuracy from honesty. Across a diverse set of LLMs, we find that while larger models obtain higher accuracy on our benchmark, they do not become more honest. Surprisingly, most frontier LLMs obtain high scores on truthfulness benchmarks yet exhibit a substantial propensity to lie under pressure, resulting in low honesty scores on our benchmark. We find that simple methods, such as representation engineering interventions, can improve honesty. These results underscore the growing need for robust evaluations and effective interventions to ensure LLMs remain trustworthy.</description>

      <title>From Intrinsic Toxicity to Reception-Based Toxicity: A Contextual Framework for Prediction and Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most toxicity detection models treat toxicity as an intrinsic property of text, overlooking the role of context in shaping its impact. In this position paper, drawing on insights from psychology, neuroscience, and computational social science, we reconceptualise toxicity as a socially emergent signal of stress. We formalise this perspective in the Contextual Stress Framework (CSF), which defines toxicity as a stress-inducing norm violation within a given context and introduces an additional dimension for toxicity detection. As one possible realisation of CSF, we introduce PONOS (Proportion Of Negative Observed Sentiments), a metric that quantifies toxicity through collective social reception rather than lexical features. We validate this approach on a novel dataset, demonstrating improved contextual sensitivity and adaptability when used alongside existing models.</description>

      <title>Offline Model-Based Optimization: Comprehensive Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Offline optimization is a fundamental challenge in science and engineering, where the goal is to optimize black-box functions using only offline datasets. This setting is particularly relevant when querying the objective function is prohibitively expensive or infeasible, with applications spanning protein engineering, material discovery, neural architecture search, and beyond. The main difficulty lies in accurately estimating the objective landscape beyond the available data, where extrapolations are fraught with significant epistemic uncertainty. This uncertainty can lead to objective hacking(reward hacking), exploiting model inaccuracies in unseen regions, or other spurious optimizations that yield misleadingly high performance estimates outside the training distribution. Recent advances in model-based optimization(MBO) have harnessed the generalization capabilities of deep neural networks to develop offline-specific surrogate and generative models. Trained with carefully designed strategies, these models are more robust against out-of-distribution issues, facilitating the discovery of improved designs. Despite its growing impact in accelerating scientific discovery, the field lacks a comprehensive review. To bridge this gap, we present the first thorough review of offline MBO. We begin by formalizing the problem for both single-objective and multi-objective settings and by reviewing recent benchmarks and evaluation metrics. We then categorize existing approaches into two key areas: surrogate modeling, which emphasizes accurate function approximation in out-of-distribution regions, and generative modeling, which explores high-dimensional design spaces to identify high-performing designs. Finally, we examine the key challenges and propose promising directions for advancement in this rapidly evolving field including safe control of superintelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Solving the Paint Shop Problem with Flexible Management of Multi-Lane Buffers Using Reinforcement Learning and Action Masking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paint shop problem, an unordered incoming sequence of cars assigned to different colors has to be reshuffled with the objective of minimizing the number of color changes. To reshuffle the incoming sequence, manufacturers can employ a first-in-first-out multi-lane buffer system allowing store and retrieve operations. So far, prior studies primarily focused on simple decision heuristics like greedy or simplified problem variants that do not allow full flexibility when performing store and retrieve operations. In this study, we propose a reinforcement learning approach to minimize color changes for the flexible problem variant, where store and retrieve operations can be performed in an arbitrary order. After proving that greedy retrieval is optimal, we incorporate this finding into the model using action masking. Our evaluation, based on 170 problem instances with 2-8 buffer lanes and 5-15 colors, shows that our approach reduces color changes compared to existing methods by considerable margins depending on the problem size. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach towards different buffer sizes and imbalanced color distributions.</description>

      <title>Heuristic Methods are Good Teachers to Distill MLPs for Graph Link Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Link prediction is a crucial graph-learning task with applications including citation prediction and product recommendation. Distilling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) teachers into Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) students has emerged as an effective approach to achieve strong performance and reducing computational cost by removing graph dependency. However, existing distillation methods only use standard GNNs and overlook alternative teachers such as specialized model for link prediction (GNN4LP) and heuristic methods (e.g., common neighbors). This paper first explores the impact of different teachers in GNN-to-MLP distillation. Surprisingly, we find that stronger teachers do not always produce stronger students: MLPs distilled from GNN4LP can underperform those distilled from simpler GNNs, while weaker heuristic methods can teach MLPs to near-GNN performance with drastically reduced training costs. Building on these insights, we propose Ensemble Heuristic-Distilled MLPs (EHDM), which eliminates graph dependencies while effectively integrating complementary signals via a gating mechanism. Experiments on ten datasets show an average 7.93% improvement over previous GNN-to-MLP approaches with 1.95-3.32 times less training time, indicating EHDM is an efficient and effective link prediction method.</description>

      <title>DisCO: Reinforcing Large Reasoning Models with Discriminative Constrained Optimization</title>

Abstract: The recent success and openness of DeepSeek-R1 have brought widespread attention to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a reinforcement learning method for large reasoning models (LRMs). In this work, we analyze the GRPO objective under a binary reward setting and reveal an inherent limitation of question-level difficulty bias. We also identify a connection between GRPO and traditional discriminative methods in supervised learning. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a new Discriminative Constrained Optimization (DisCO) framework for reinforcing LRMs, grounded in the principle of discriminative learning. The main differences between DisCO and GRPO and its recent variants are: (1) it replaces the group relative objective with a discriminative objective defined by a scoring function; (2) it abandons clipping-based surrogates in favor of non-clipping RL surrogate objectives used as scoring functions; (3) it employs a simple yet effective constrained optimization approach to enforce the KL divergence constraint. As a result, DisCO offers notable advantages over GRPO and its variants: (i) it completely eliminates difficulty bias by adopting discriminative objectives; (ii) it addresses the entropy instability in GRPO and its variants through the use of non-clipping scoring functions and a constrained optimization approach, yielding long and stable training dynamics; (iii) it allows the incorporation of advanced discriminative learning techniques to address data imbalance, where a significant number of questions have more negative than positive generated answers during training. Our experiments on enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of SFT-finetuned models show that DisCO significantly outperforms GRPO and its improved variants such as DAPO, achieving average gains of 7\% over GRPO and 6\% over DAPO across six benchmark tasks for a 1.5B model.</description>

      <title>A new type of federated clustering: A non-model-sharing approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering), a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled. DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance.</description>

      <title>Aha Moment Revisited: Are VLMs Truly Capable of Self Verification in Inference-time Scaling?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inference time techniques such as decoding time scaling and self refinement have been shown to substantially improve mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), largely attributed to emergent self correction and self verification behaviors often elicited through reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we ask whether the same recipe transfers to vision language models (VLMs), especially RL finetuned variants that claim strong visual mathematical reasoning.
  Through extensive evaluation, we reach three main findings that differ markedly from text only models. First, generation time capability matters more than verification and refinement: simple majority voting consistently and substantially outperforms verification centric strategies such as best of N with self verification. Second, behaviors often associated with RL tuned models at inference time, such as the 'Aha moment,' do not yield reliable reasoning performance improvements. Third, visual information is not effectively integrated into the model's self verification process.
  Overall, our analysis highlights a key limitation: current RL trained VLMs derive limited benefit from self verification in the visual modality, which constrains the effectiveness of inference time scaling for visual mathematical reasoning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce MIRAGE, a new benchmark for multimodal expert-level reasoning and decision-making in consultative interaction settings. Designed for the agriculture domain, MIRAGE captures the full complexity of expert consultations by combining natural user queries, expert-authored responses, and image-based context, offering a high-fidelity benchmark for evaluating models on grounded reasoning, clarification strategies, and long-form generation in a real-world, knowledge-intensive domain. Grounded in over 35,000 real user-expert interactions and curated through a carefully designed multi-step pipeline, MIRAGE spans diverse crop health, pest diagnosis, and crop management scenarios. The benchmark includes more than 7,000 unique biological entities, covering plant species, pests, and diseases, making it one of the most taxonomically diverse benchmarks available for vision-language models, grounded in the real world. Unlike existing benchmarks that rely on well-specified user inputs and closed-set taxonomies, MIRAGE features underspecified, context-rich scenarios with open-world settings, requiring models to infer latent knowledge gaps, handle rare entities, and either proactively guide the interaction or respond.

      <title>Information-Theoretic Generalization Bounds of Replay-based Continual Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for acquiring knowledge from sequential tasks while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Although many CL methods have been proposed to show impressive empirical performance, the theoretical understanding of their generalization behavior remains limited, particularly for replay-based approaches. This paper establishes a unified theoretical framework for replay-based CL, deriving a series of information-theoretic generalization bounds that explicitly elucidate the impact of the memory buffer alongside the current task on generalization performance. Specifically, our hypothesis-based bounds capture the trade-off between the number of selected exemplars and the information dependency between the hypothesis and the memory buffer. Our prediction-based bounds yield tighter and computationally tractable upper bounds on the generalization error by leveraging low-dimensional variables. Theoretical analysis is general and broadly applicable to a wide range of learning algorithms, exemplified by stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) as a representative method. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our derived bounds in capturing the generalization dynamics in replay-based CL settings.</description>

      <title>U-PINet: Physics-Informed Hierarchical Learning for Accurate and Fast 3D RCS Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate radar cross section (RCS) computation is a fundamental task in radar engineering and electromagnetic (EM) scattering analysis, underpinning target signature characterization, detection, and recognition. Conventional computational electromagnetics (CEM) solvers provide high-fidelity RCS predictions but suffer from prohibitive computational costs when applied to 3-dimensional (3D) targets under multi-aspect configurations. In contrast, purely data-driven neural networks offer high efficiency yet often lack physical consistency and generalization capability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a U-shaped Physics-Informed Network (U-PINet). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to establish a fully end-to-end, physics-informed hierarchical architecture for fast and accurate RCS computation, grounded in the governing principles of CEM. Inspired by the near-far field decomposition in classical fast solvers, U-PINet explicitly models local EM coupling and long-range radiation effects through a hierarchical operator design. A physics-guided graph construction is further introduced to represent self- and mutual-coupling among mesh elements of complex 3D targets, enabling physically interpretable intermediate representations. By embedding EM governing equations as residual constraints, the proposed framework achieves end-to-end, physically consistent RCS prediction with significantly improved computational efficiency. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that U-PINet attains solver-level RCS accuracy with orders-of-magnitude runtime reduction, while exhibiting strong generalization to unseen target geometries under limited training data.</description>

      <title>IPA: An Information-Reconstructive Input Projection Framework for Efficient Foundation Model Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, reduce adaptation cost by injecting low-rank updates into pretrained weights. However, LoRA's down-projection is randomly initialized and data-agnostic, discarding potentially useful information. Prior analyses show that this projection changes little during training, while the up-projection carries most of the adaptation, making the random input compression a performance bottleneck. We propose IPA, a feature-aware projection framework that explicitly aims to reconstruct the original input within a reduced hidden space. In the linear case, we instantiate IPA with algorithms approximating top principal components, enabling efficient projector pretraining with negligible inference overhead. Across language and vision benchmarks, IPA consistently improves over LoRA and DoRA, achieving on average 1.5 points higher accuracy on commonsense reasoning and 2.3 points on VTAB-1k, while matching full LoRA performance with roughly half the trainable parameters when the projection is frozen.

      <title>Learning Optimal Defender Strategies for CAGE-2 using a POMDP Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CAGE-2 is an accepted benchmark for learning and evaluating defender strategies against cyberattacks. It reflects a scenario where a defender agent protects an IT infrastructure against various attacks. Many defender methods for CAGE-2 have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we construct a formal model for CAGE-2 using the framework of Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Based on this model, we define an optimal defender strategy for CAGE-2 and introduce a method to efficiently learn this strategy. Our method, called BF-PPO, is based on PPO, and it uses particle filter to mitigate the computational complexity due to the large state space of the CAGE-2 model. We evaluate our method in the CAGE-2 CybORG environment and compare its performance with that of CARDIFF, the highest ranked method on the CAGE-2 leaderboard. We find that our method outperforms CARDIFF regarding the learned defender strategy and the required training time.</description>

      <title>CaTS-Bench: Can Language Models Describe Time Series?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing time series in natural language, requires numeric and temporal reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on fully synthetic or generic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual representations. We introduce \textbf{CaTS-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark for \textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{a}ware \textbf{T}ime \textbf{S}eries reasoning across $11$ diverse domains, centered on a gold-standard evaluation set of $1746$ human-rewritten captions that measure how effectively models translate numeric trends into immediately interpretable narratives. To address the scarcity of human-annotated data, we also propose a scalable pipeline for generating high-fidelity synthetic captions, the quality of which we validate. We evaluate leading Vision-Language Models on our benchmark, revealing that even proprietary models struggle to capture numeric nuances in temporal descriptions, while finetuning open-source models on synthetic data yields substantial performance gains. Finally, release a diagnostic suite of $910$ multiple-choice questions and tailored numeric metrics to gauge time-series-specific reasoning capabilities, establishing CaTS-Bench as a reliable foundation for grounded, multimodal language generation in numeric domains.</description>

      <title>Universal Dynamic Regret and Constraint Violation Bounds for Constrained Online Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of the celebrated Online Convex Optimization (OCO) framework with adversarial online constraints. In this problem, an online learner interacts with an adversary sequentially over multiple rounds. At the beginning of each round, the learner chooses an action from a convex decision set. After that, the adversary reveals a convex cost function and a convex constraint function. The goal of the learner is to minimize the cumulative cost while satisfying the constraints as tightly as possible. We present two efficient algorithms with simple modular structures that give universal dynamic regret and cumulative constraint violation bounds, improving upon state-of-the-art results. While the first algorithm, which achieves the optimal regret bound, involves projection onto the constraint sets, the second algorithm is projection-free and achieves better violation bounds in rapidly varying environments. Our results hold in the most general case when both the cost and constraint functions are chosen arbitrarily, and the constraint functions need not contain any fixed common feasible point. We establish these results by introducing a general framework that reduces the constrained learning problem to an instance of the standard OCO problem with specially constructed surrogate cost functions.</description>

      <title>What Makes Looped Transformers Perform Better Than Non-Recursive Ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While looped transformers (termed as Looped-Attn) often outperform standard transformers (termed as Single-Attn) on complex reasoning tasks, the mechanism for this advantage remains underexplored. In this paper, we explain this phenomenon through the lens of loss landscape geometry, inspired by empirical observations of their distinct dynamics at both sample and Hessian levels. To formalize this, we extend the River-Valley landscape model by distinguishing between U-shaped valleys (flat) and V-shaped valleys (steep). Based on empirical observations, we conjecture that the recursive architecture of Looped-Attn induces a landscape-level inductive bias towards River-V-Valley. This inductive bias suggest a better loss convergence along the river due to valley hopping, and further encourage learning about complex patterns compared to the River-U-Valley induced by Single-Attn. Building on this insight, we propose SHIFT (Staged HIerarchical Framework for Progressive Training), a principled training strategy that accelerates the training process of Looped-Attn while achieving comparable performances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless, they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret them via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification. After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments, we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.</description>

      <title>Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion for Extendable Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) integrates diffusion models with structured tree search to enable effective trajectory exploration through stepwise reasoning. However, MCTD remains fundamentally limited by training trajectory lengths. While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.</description>

      <title>Block-Diagonal LoRA for Eliminating Communication Overhead in Tensor Parallel LoRA Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When serving a single base LLM with several different LoRA adapters simultaneously, the adapters cannot simply be merged with the base model's weights as the adapter swapping would create overhead and requests using different adapters could not be batched. Rather, the LoRA computations have to be separated from the base LLM computations, and in a multi-device setup the LoRA adapters can be sharded in a way that is well aligned with the base model's tensor parallel execution, as proposed in S-LoRA. However, the S-LoRA sharding strategy encounters some communication overhead, which may be small in theory, but can be large in practice. In this paper, we propose to constrain certain LoRA factors to be block-diagonal, which allows for an alternative way of sharding LoRA adapters that does not require any additional communication for the LoRA computations. We demonstrate in extensive experiments that our block-diagonal LoRA approach is similarly parameter efficient as standard LoRA (i.e., for a similar number of parameters it achieves similar downstream performance) and that it leads to significant end-to-end speed-up over S-LoRA. For example, when serving on eight A100 GPUs, we observe up to 1.79x (1.23x) end-to-end speed-up with 0.87x (1.74x) the number of adapter parameters for Llama-3.1-70B, and up to 1.63x (1.3x) end-to-end speed-up with 0.86x (1.73x) the number of adapter parameters for Llama-3.1-8B.</description>

      <title>Do Not Step Into the Same River Twice: Learning to Reason from Trial and Error</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly boosted the reasoning capability of language models (LMs) recently. However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LMs based on their own generated on-policy responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LMs, thus prone to exploration stagnation, in which LMs fail to solve more training problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems, but relies on external expert guidance that is limited in availability and scalability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and Error), an approach that hints LMs with their previously self-made mistakes, not requiring any external expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 5.02 in Pass@1 and 9.96 in Pass@k on average across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks for Qwen3-8B-Base and even performs better than methods that require external gold solutions as guidance after aligning the experimental setup. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and exploration during training.

      <description>arXiv:2510.27123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Offline contextual bandits allow one to learn policies from historical/offline data without requiring online interaction. However, offline policy optimization that maximizes overall expected rewards can unintentionally amplify the reward disparities across groups. As a result, some groups might benefit more than others from the learned policy, raising concerns about fairness, especially when the resources are limited. In this paper, we study a group-sensitive fairness constraint in offline contextual bandits, reducing group-wise reward disparities that may arise during policy learning. We tackle the following common-parity requirements: the reward disparity is constrained within some user-defined threshold or the reward disparity should be minimized during policy optimization. We propose a constrained offline policy optimization framework by introducing group-wise reward disparity constraints into an off-policy gradient-based optimization procedure. To improve the estimation of the group-wise reward disparity during training, we employ a doubly robust estimator and further provide a convergence guarantee for policy optimization. Empirical results in synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces reward disparities while maintaining competitive overall performance.</description>

      <title>Adapting Web Agents with Synthetic Supervision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Web agents struggle to adapt to new websites due to the scarcity of environment specific tasks and demonstrations. Recent works have explored synthetic data generation to address this challenge, however, they suffer from data quality issues where synthesized tasks contain hallucinations that cannot be executed, and collected trajectories are noisy with redundant or misaligned actions. In this paper, we propose SynthAgent, a fully synthetic supervision framework that aims at improving synthetic data quality via dual refinement of both tasks and trajectories. Our approach begins by synthesizing diverse tasks through categorized exploration of web elements, ensuring efficient coverage of the target environment. During trajectory collection, tasks are refined only when conflicts with observations are detected, which mitigates hallucinations while preserving task consistency. After collection, we conduct trajectory refinement with global context to mitigate potential noise or misalignments. Finally, we fine-tune open-source web agents on the refined synthetic data to adapt them to the target environment. Experimental results demonstrate that SynthAgent outperforms existing synthetic data methods, validating the importance of high-quality synthetic supervision. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/SynthAgent.</description>

      <title>Learning the Basis: A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Approach Embedding Green's Function Priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Method of Moments (MoM) is constrained by the usage of static, geometry-defined basis functions, such as the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis. This letter reframes electromagnetic modeling around a learnable basis representation rather than solving for the coefficients over a fixed basis. We first show that the RWG basis is essentially a static and piecewise-linear realization of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Inspired by this insight, we propose PhyKAN, a physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that generalizes RWG into a learnable and adaptive basis family. Derived from the EFIE, PhyKAN integrates a local KAN branch with a global branch embedded with Green's function priors to preserve physical consistency. It is demonstrated that, across canonical geometries, PhyKAN achieves sub-0.01 reconstruction errors as well as accurate, unsupervised radar cross section predictions, offering an interpretable, physics-consistent bridge between classical solvers and modern neural network models for electromagnetic modeling.</description>

      <title>Learning with Statistical Equality Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As machine learning applications grow increasingly ubiquitous and complex, they face an increasing set of requirements beyond accuracy. The prevalent approach to handle this challenge is to aggregate a weighted combination of requirement violation penalties into the training objective. To be effective, this approach requires careful tuning of these hyperparameters (weights), involving trial-and-error and cross-validation, which becomes ineffective even for a moderate number of requirements. These issues are exacerbated when the requirements involve parities or equalities, as is the case in fairness and boundary value problems. An alternative technique uses constrained optimization to formulate these learning problems. Yet, existing approximation and generalization guarantees do not apply to problems involving equality constraints. In this work, we derive a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning problems, showing that their solutions can be approximated using samples and rich parametrizations. Using these results, we propose a practical algorithm based on solving a sequence of unconstrained, empirical learning problems. We showcase its effectiveness and the new formulations enabled by equality constraints in fair learning, interpolating classifiers, and boundary value problems.</description>

      <title>LoFT-LLM: Low-Frequency Time-Series Forecasting with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-series forecasting in real-world applications such as finance and energy often faces challenges due to limited training data and complex, noisy temporal dynamics. Existing deep forecasting models typically supervise predictions using full-length temporal windows, which include substantial high-frequency noise and obscure long-term trends. Moreover, auxiliary variables containing rich domain-specific information are often underutilized, especially in few-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose LoFT-LLM, a frequency-aware forecasting pipeline that integrates low-frequency learning with semantic calibration via a large language model (LLM). Firstly, a Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module (PLFM) extracts stable low-frequency trends from localized spectral patches. Secondly, a residual learner then models high-frequency variations. Finally, a fine-tuned LLM refines the predictions by incorporating auxiliary context and domain knowledge through structured natural language prompts. Extensive experiments on financial and energy datasets demonstrate that LoFT-LLM significantly outperforms strong baselines under both full-data and few-shot regimes, delivering superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Mixture-of-Experts with Gradient Conflict-Driven Subspace Topology Pruning for Emergent Modularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures achieve parameter efficiency through conditional computation, yet contemporary designs suffer from two fundamental limitations: structural parameter isolation that causes catastrophic forgetting, and instruction-overfitting that degrades performance in instruction-free scenarios. We propose CDSP-MoE (Conflict-Driven Subspace Pruning MoE), a framework that addresses these issues through a paradigm shift from isolated expert containers to dynamic expert instantiation within a shared physical subspace. Grounded in the Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis, CDSP-MoE maintains a super-complete parameter backbone where logical experts are carved out via learnable topology masks. Unlike prior work that uses gradient conflict for token reassignment or optimization surgery, we leverage it as a structural supervisory signal: a Lagged Gradient Game penalizes interfering connections in the shared manifold, enabling the topology to spontaneously prune conflicting pathways and evolve interpretable modular structures. Experimental results demonstrate that CDSP-MoE achieves robust content-driven routing without human-defined task labels, maintaining semantic specialization even under strict blind inference protocols where explicit instructions are absent.

      <title>A Comedy of Estimators: On KL Regularization in RL Training of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) can be substantially improved by training them with reinforcement learning (RL). The RL objective for LLM training involves a regularization term, which is the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the trained policy and the reference policy. Since computing the KL divergence exactly is intractable, various estimators are used in practice to estimate it from on-policy samples. Despite its wide adoption, including in several open-source libraries, there is no systematic study analyzing the numerous ways of incorporating KL estimators in the objective and their effect on the downstream performance of RL-trained models. Recent works show that prevailing practices for incorporating KL regularization do not provide correct gradients for stated objectives, creating a discrepancy between the objective and its implementation. In this paper, we further analyze these practices and study the gradients of several estimators configurations, revealing how design choices shape gradient bias. We substantiate these findings with empirical observations by RL fine-tuning \texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}, \texttt{Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct} and \texttt{Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507} with different configurations and evaluating their performance on both in- and out-of-distribution tasks. Through our analysis, we observe that, in on-policy settings: (1) estimator configurations with biased gradients can result in training instabilities; and (2) using estimator configurations resulting in unbiased gradients leads to better performance on in-domain as well as out-of-domain tasks. We also investigate the performance resulting from different KL configurations in off-policy settings and observe that KL regularization can help stabilize off-policy RL training resulting from asynchronous setups.</description>

      <title>DiRL: An Efficient Post-Training Framework for Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives to Auto-Regressive (AR) models. While recent efforts have validated their pre-training potential and accelerated inference speeds, the post-training landscape for dLLMs remains underdeveloped. Existing methods suffer from computational inefficiency and objective mismatches between training and inference, severely limiting performance on complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics. To address this, we introduce DiRL, an efficient post-training framework that tightly integrates FlexAttention-accelerated blockwise training with LMDeploy-optimized inference. This architecture enables a streamlined online model update loop, facilitating efficient two-stage post-training (Supervised Fine-Tuning followed by Reinforcement Learning). Building on this framework, we propose DiPO, the first unbiased Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) implementation tailored for dLLMs. We validate our approach by training DiRL-8B-Instruct on high-quality math data. Our model achieves state-of-the-art math performance among dLLMs and surpasses comparable models in the Qwen2.5 series on several benchmarks.</description>

      <title>When Does Multi-Task Learning Fail? Quantifying Data Imbalance and Task Independence in Metal Alloy Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) is widely adopted in materials informatics under the assumption that related properties share leverageable physical principles. This study critically examines this premise by simultaneously predicting electrical resistivity, Vickers hardness, and amorphous-forming ability using a dataset of 54,028 metal alloys.1 Contrary to expectations, we observe a striking dichotomy: MTL significantly degrades regression accuracy (e.g., hardness 2$R^2$ drops from 3$0.832$ to 4$0.694$) while improving classification performance (amorphous F1 increases from 5$0.703$ to 6$0.744$).7 Analysis of learned task graphs reveals negligible inter-task correlations, attributing regression failure to negative transfer driven by severe data imbalance (52,388 vs. 800 samples). To mitigate this, we evaluate Deep Imbalanced Regression techniques. PCGrad recovers hardness performance ($R^2 \rightarrow 0.855$) by resolving gradient conflicts, while LDS+GradNorm achieves the best overall multi-task balance. Our findings suggest that alloy properties often behave independently, necessitating specific strategies: independent models for maximum regression precision, PCGrad for minority tasks, and LDS+GradNorm when balanced joint prediction is required.</description>

      <title>Interpretability-Guided Bi-objective Optimization: Aligning Accuracy and Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Interpretability-Guided Bi-objective Optimization (IGBO), a framework that trains interpretable models by incorporating structured domain knowledge via a bi-objective formulation. IGBO encodes feature importance hierarchies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) via Central Limit Theorem-based construction and uses Temporal Integrated Gradients (TIG) to measure feature importance. To address the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) problem in TIG computation, we propose an Optimal Path Oracle that learns data-manifold-aware integration paths. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence properties via a geometric projection mapping $\mathcal{P}$ and proves robustness to mini-batch noise. Central Limit Theorem-based construction of the interpretability DAG ensures statistical validity of edge orientation decisions. Empirical results on time-series data demonstrate IGBO's effectiveness in enforcing DAG constraints with minimal accuracy loss, outperforming standard regularization baselines.</description>

      <title>Geometric and Dynamic Scaling in Deep Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their empirical success, pushing Transformer architectures to extreme depth often leads to a paradoxical failure: representations become increasingly redundant, lose rank, and ultimately collapse. Existing explanations largely attribute this phenomenon to optimization instability or vanishing gradients, yet such accounts fail to explain why collapse persists even under modern normalization and initialization schemes. In this paper, we argue that the collapse of deep Transformers is fundamentally a geometric problem. Standard residual updates implicitly assume that feature accumulation is always beneficial, but offer no mechanism to constrain update directions or to erase outdated information. As depth increases, this leads to systematic drift off the semantic manifold and monotonic feature accumulation, causing representational degeneracy. We propose a unified geometric framework that addresses these failures through two orthogonal principles. First, manifold-constrained hyper-connections restrict residual updates to valid local tangent directions, preventing uncontrolled manifold drift. Second, deep delta learning introduces data-dependent, non-monotonic updates that enable reflection and erasure of redundant features rather than their unconditional accumulation. Together, these mechanisms decouple the direction and sign of feature updates, yielding a stable geometric evolution across depth. We term the resulting architecture the Manifold-Geometric Transformer (MGT). Our analysis predicts that enforcing geometric validity while allowing dynamic erasure is essential for avoiding rank collapse in ultra-deep networks. We outline an evaluation protocol for Transformers exceeding 100 layers to test the hypothesis that geometry, rather than depth itself, is the key limiting factor in deep representation learning.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained Kullback--Leibler Control of Diffusion-Based Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models and score-based generative models provide a powerful framework for synthesizing high-quality images from noise. However, there is still no satisfactory theory that describes how coarse-grained quantities, such as blockwise intensity or class proportions after partitioning an image into spatial blocks, are preserved and evolve along the reverse diffusion dynamics. In previous work, the author introduced an information-theoretic Lyapunov function V for non-ergodic Markov processes on a state space partitioned into blocks, defined as the minimal Kullback-Leibler divergence to the set of stationary distributions reachable from a given initial condition, and showed that a leak-tolerant potential V-delta with a prescribed tolerance for block masses admits a closed-form expression as a scaling-and-clipping operation on block masses.
  In this paper, I transplant this framework to the reverse diffusion process in generative models and propose a reverse diffusion scheme that is projected by the potential V-delta (referred to as the V-delta projected reverse diffusion). I extend the monotonicity of V to time-inhomogeneous block-preserving Markov kernels and show that, under small leakage and the V-delta projection, V-delta acts as an approximate Lyapunov function. Furthermore, using a toy model consisting of block-constant images and a simplified reverse kernel, I numerically demonstrate that the proposed method keeps the block-mass error and the leak-tolerant potential within the prescribed tolerance, while achieving pixel-wise accuracy and visual quality comparable to the non-projected dynamics. This study reinterprets generative sampling as a decrease of an information potential from noise to data, and provides a design principle for reverse diffusion processes with explicit control of coarse-grained quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ML-UCB, a generalized upper confidence bound algorithm that integrates arbitrary machine learning models into multi-armed bandit frameworks. A fundamental challenge in deploying sophisticated ML models for sequential decision-making is the lack of tractable concentration inequalities required for principled exploration. We overcome this limitation by directly modeling the learning curve behavior of the underlying estimator. Specifically, assuming the Mean Squared Error decreases as a power law in the number of training samples, we derive a generalized concentration inequality and prove that ML-UCB achieves sublinear regret. This framework enables the principled integration of any ML model whose learning curve can be empirically characterized, eliminating the need for model-specific theoretical analysis. We validate our approach through experiments on a collaborative filtering recommendation system using online matrix factorization with synthetic data designed to simulate a simplified two-tower model, demonstrating substantial improvements over LinUCB</description>

      <title>Accelerating Storage-Based Training for Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved breakthroughs in various real-world downstream tasks due to their powerful expressiveness. As the scale of real-world graphs has been continuously growing, a storage-based approach to GNN training has been studied, which leverages external storage (e.g., NVMe SSDs) to handle such web-scale graphs on a single machine. Although such storage-based GNN training methods have shown promising potential in large-scale GNN training, we observed that they suffer from a severe bottleneck in data preparation since they overlook a critical challenge: how to handle a large number of small storage I/Os. To address the challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel storage-based GNN training framework, named AGNES, that employs a method of block-wise storage I/O processing to fully utilize the I/O bandwidth of high-performance storage devices. Moreover, to further enhance the efficiency of each storage I/O, AGNES employs a simple yet effective strategy, hyperbatch-based processing based on the characteristics of real-world graphs. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world graphs reveal that AGNES consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art methods, by up to 4.1X faster than the best competitor.

      <description>arXiv:2601.01887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-tuning safety-aligned large language models (LLMs) can substantially compromise their safety. Previous approaches require many safety samples or calibration sets, which not only incur significant computational overhead during realignment but also lead to noticeable degradation in model utility. Contrary to this belief, we show that safety alignment can be fully recovered with only a single safety example, without sacrificing utility and at minimal cost. Remarkably, this recovery is effective regardless of the number of harmful examples used in fine-tuning or the size of the underlying model, and convergence is achieved within just a few epochs. Furthermore, we uncover the low-rank structure of the safety gradient, which explains why such efficient correction is possible. We validate our findings across five safety-aligned LLMs and multiple datasets, demonstrating the generality of our approach.</description>

      <title>At the Intersection of Deep Sequential Model Framework and State-space Model Framework: Study on Option Pricing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.07784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inference and forecast problems of the nonlinear dynamical system have arisen in a variety of contexts. Reservoir computing and deep sequential models, on the one hand, have demonstrated efficient, robust, and superior performance in modeling simple and chaotic dynamical systems. However, their innate deterministic feature has partially detracted their robustness to noisy system, and their inability to offer uncertainty measurement has also been an insufficiency of the framework. On the other hand, the traditional state-space model framework is robust to noise. It also carries measured uncertainty, forming a just-right complement to the reservoir computing and deep sequential model framework. We propose the unscented reservoir smoother, a model that unifies both deep sequential and state-space models to achieve both frameworks' superiorities. Evaluated in the option pricing setting on top of noisy datasets, URS strikes highly competitive forecasting accuracy, especially those of longer-term, and uncertainty measurement. Further extensions and implications on URS are also discussed to generalize a full integration of both frameworks.</description>

      <title>Development of a high-resolution indoor radon map using a new machine learning-based probabilistic model and German radon survey data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11143v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate knowledge of indoor radon concentration is crucial for assessing radon-related health effects or identifying radon-prone areas. Indoor radon concentration at the national scale is usually estimated on the basis of extensive measurement campaigns. However, characteristics of the sampled households often differ from the characteristics of the target population owing to the large number of relevant factors that control the indoor radon concentration, such as the availability of geogenic radon or floor level. We propose a model-based approach that allows a more realistic estimation of indoor radon distribution with a higher spatial resolution than a purely data-based approach. A modeling approach was used by applying a quantile regression forest to estimate the probability distribution function of indoor radon for each floor level of each residential building in Germany. Based on the estimated probability distribution function,a probabilistic Monte Carlo sampling technique was applied, enabling the combination and population weighting of floor-level predictions. In this way,the uncertainty of the individual predictions is effectively propagated into the estimate of variability at the aggregated level. The results show an approximate lognormal distribution of indoor radon in dwellings in Germany with an arithmetic mean of 63 Bq/m3, a geometric mean of 41 Bq/m3, and a 95th percentile of 180 Bq/m3. The exceedance probabilities for 100 and 300 Bq/m3 are 12.5% (10.5 million people affected) and 2.2 % (1.9 million people affected), respectively. The advantages of our approach are that it yields a) an accurate estimation of indoor radon concentration even if the survey is not fully representative with respect to floor level and radon concentration in soil, and b) an estimate of the indoor radon distribution with a much higher spatial resolution than basic descriptive statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05187v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) is a popular framework in reinforcement learning, serving as a unifying perspective that encompasses numerous algorithms. These algorithms are derived through the selection of a mirror map and enjoy finite-time convergence guarantees. Despite its popularity, the exploration of PMD's full potential is limited, with the majority of research focusing on a particular mirror map -- namely, the negative entropy -- which gives rise to the renowned Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) method. It remains uncertain from existing theoretical studies whether the choice of mirror map significantly influences PMD's efficacy. In our work, we conduct empirical investigations to show that the conventional mirror map choice (NPG) often yields less-than-optimal outcomes across several standard benchmark environments. Using evolutionary strategies, we identify more efficient mirror maps that enhance the performance of PMD. We first focus on a tabular environment, i.e. Grid-World, where we relate existing theoretical bounds with the performance of PMD for a few standard mirror maps and the learned one. We then show that it is possible to learn a mirror map that outperforms the negative entropy in more complex environments, such as the MinAtar suite. Additionally, we demonstrate that the learned mirror maps generalize effectively to different tasks by testing each map across various other environments.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Decentralized Stochastic Subgradient-based Methods for Nonsmooth Nonconvex functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11565v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the decentralized stochastic subgradient-based methods in minimizing nonsmooth nonconvex functions without Clarke regularity, especially in the decentralized training of nonsmooth neural networks. We propose a general framework that unifies various decentralized subgradient-based methods, such as decentralized stochastic subgradient descent (DSGD), DSGD with gradient-tracking technique (DSGD-T), and DSGD with momentum (DSGD-M). To establish the convergence properties of our proposed framework, we relate the discrete iterates to the trajectories of a continuous-time differential inclusion, which is assumed to have a coercive Lyapunov function with a stable set $\mathcal{A}$. We prove the asymptotic convergence of the iterates to the stable set $\mathcal{A}$ with sufficiently small and diminishing step-sizes. These results provide first convergence guarantees for some well-recognized of decentralized stochastic subgradient-based methods without Clarke regularity of the objective function. Preliminary numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework yields highly efficient decentralized stochastic subgradient-based methods with convergence guarantees in the training of nonsmooth neural networks.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses the design of safety certificates for stochastic systems, with a focus on ensuring long-term safety through fast real-time control. In stochastic environments, set invariance-based methods that restrict the probability of risk events in infinitesimal time intervals may exhibit significant long-term risks due to cumulative uncertainties/risks. On the other hand, reachability-based approaches that account for the long-term future may require prohibitive computation in real-time decision making. To overcome this challenge involving stringent long-term safety vs. computation tradeoffs, we first introduce a novel technique termed 'probabilistic invariance'. This technique characterizes the invariance conditions of the probability of interest. When the target probability is defined using long-term trajectories, this technique can be used to design myopic conditions/controllers with assured long-term safe probability. Then, we integrate this technique into safe control and learning. The proposed control methods efficiently assure long-term safety using neural networks or model predictive controllers with short outlook horizons. The proposed learning methods can be used to guarantee long-term safety during and after training. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed techniques in numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Limits to Predicting Online Speech Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our paper studies the predictability of online speech -- that is, how well language models learn to model the distribution of user generated content on X (previously Twitter). We define predictability as a measure of the model's uncertainty, i.e. its negative log-likelihood. As the basis of our study, we collect 10M tweets for ``tweet-tuning'' base models and a further 6.25M posts from more than five thousand X (previously Twitter) users and their peers. In our study involving more than 5000 subjects, we find that predicting posts of individual users remains surprisingly hard. Moreover, it matters greatly what context is used: models using the users' own history significantly outperform models using posts from their social circle. We validate these results across four large language models ranging in size from 1.5 billion to 70 billion parameters. Moreover, our results replicate if instead of prompting the model with additional context, we finetune on it. We follow up with a detailed investigation on what is learned in-context and a demographic analysis. Up to 20\% of what is learned in-context is the use of @-mentions and hashtags. Our main results hold across the demographic groups we studied.</description>

      <title>SaVe-TAG: LLM-based Interpolation for Long-Tailed Text-Attributed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16882v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world graph data often follows long-tailed distributions, making it difficult for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generalize well across both head and tail classes. Recent advances in Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) have shown promise in mitigating class imbalance with numeric interpolation; however, existing approaches largely rely on embedding-space arithmetic, which fails to capture the rich semantics inherent in text-attributed graphs. In this work, we propose our method, SaVe-TAG (Semantic-aware Vicinal Risk Minimization for Long-Tailed Text-Attributed Graphs), a novel VRM framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform text-level interpolation, generating on-manifold, boundary-enriching synthetic samples for minority classes. To mitigate the risk of noisy generation, we introduce a confidence-based edge assignment mechanism that uses graph topology as a natural filter to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical justification for our method and conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, showing that our approach consistently outperforms both numeric interpolation and prior long-tailed node classification baselines. Our results highlight the importance of integrating semantic and structural signals for balanced and effective learning on text-attributed graphs.

      <title>MemHunter: Automated and Verifiable Memorization Detection at Dataset-scale in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to memorize and reproduce content from their training data, raising significant privacy concerns, especially with web-scale datasets. Existing methods for detecting memorization are primarily sample-specific, relying on manually crafted or discretely optimized memory-inducing prompts generated on a per-sample basis, which become impractical for dataset-level detection due to the prohibitive computational cost of iterating through all samples. In real-world scenarios, data owners may need to verify whether a susceptible LLM has memorized their dataset, particularly if the LLM may have collected the data from the web without authorization. To address this, we introduce MemHunter, which trains a memory-inducing LLM and employs hypothesis testing to efficiently detect memorization at the dataset level, without requiring sample-specific memory inducing. Experiments on models like Pythia and Llama demonstrate that MemHunter can extract up to 40% more training data than existing methods under constrained time resources and reduce search time by up to 80% when integrated as a plug-in. Crucially, MemHunter is the first method capable of dataset-level memorization detection, providing a critical tool for assessing privacy risks in LLMs powered by large-scale datasets.</description>

      <title>RobotDiffuse: Diffusion-Based Motion Planning for Redundant Manipulators with the ROP Obstacle Avoidance Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Redundant manipulators, with their higher Degrees of Freedom (DoFs), offer enhanced kinematic performance and versatility, making them suitable for applications like manufacturing, surgical robotics, and human-robot collaboration. However, motion planning for these manipulators is challenging due to increased DoFs and complex, dynamic environments. While traditional motion planning algorithms struggle with high-dimensional spaces, deep learning-based methods often face instability and inefficiency in complex tasks. This paper introduces RobotDiffuse, a diffusion model-based approach for motion planning in redundant manipulators. By integrating physical constraints with a point cloud encoder and replacing the U-Net structure with an encoder-only transformer, RobotDiffuse improves the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies and generate smoother, more coherent motion plans. We validate the approach using a complex simulator and release a new dataset, Robot-obtalcles-panda (ROP), with 35M robot poses and 0.14M obstacle avoidance scenarios. The highest overall score obtained in the experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of RobotDiffuse and the promise of diffusion models for motion planning tasks.

      <title>Global law of conjugate kernel random matrices with heavy-tailed weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic spectral distribution of the conjugate kernel random matrix $YY^\top$, where $Y= f(WX)$ arises from a two-layer neural network model. We consider the setting where $W$ and $X$ are random rectangular matrices with i.i.d.\ entries, where the entries of $W$ follow a heavy-tailed distribution, while those of $X$ have light tails. Our assumptions on $W$ include a broad class of heavy-tailed distributions, such as symmetric $\alpha$-stable laws with $\alpha \in ]0,2[$ and sparse matrices with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ nonzero entries per row. The activation function $f$, applied entrywise, is bounded, smooth, odd, and nonlinear. We compute the limiting eigenvalue distribution of $YY^\top$ through its moments and show that heavy-tailed weights induce strong correlations between the entries of $Y$, resulting in richer and fundamentally different spectral behavior compared to the light-tailed case.</description>

      <title>SPARKLE: A Nonparametric Approach for Online Decision-Making with High-Dimensional Covariates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalized services are central to today's digital economy, and their sequential decisions are often modeled as contextual bandits. Modern applications pose two main challenges: high-dimensional covariates and the need for nonparametric models to capture complex reward-covariate relationships. We propose SPARKLE, a novel contextual bandit algorithm based on a sparse additive reward model that addresses both challenges through (i) a doubly penalized estimator for nonparametric reward estimation and (ii) an epoch-based design with adaptive screening to balance exploration and exploitation. We prove a sublinear regret bound that grows only logarithmically in the covariate dimensionality; to our knowledge, this is the first such result for nonparametric contextual bandits with high-dimensional covariates. We also derive an information-theoretic lower bound, and the gap to the upper bound vanishes as the reward smoothness increases. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real data from video recommendation and personalized medicine show strong performance in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>UniversalRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation over Corpora of Diverse Modalities and Granularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown substantial promise in improving factual accuracy by grounding model responses with external knowledge relevant to queries. However, most existing approaches are limited to a text-only corpus, and while recent efforts have extended RAG to other modalities such as images and videos, they typically operate over a single modality-specific corpus. In contrast, real-world queries vary widely in the type of knowledge they require, which a single type of knowledge source cannot address. To address this, we introduce UniversalRAG, designed to retrieve and integrate knowledge from heterogeneous sources with diverse modalities and granularities. Specifically, motivated by the observation that forcing all modalities into a unified representation space derived from a single aggregated corpus causes a modality gap, where the retrieval tends to favor items from the same modality as the query, we propose modality-aware routing, which dynamically identifies the most appropriate modality-specific corpus and performs targeted retrieval within it, and further justify its effectiveness with a theoretical analysis. Moreover, beyond modality, we organize each modality into multiple granularity levels, enabling fine-tuned retrieval tailored to the complexity and scope of the query. We validate UniversalRAG on 10 benchmarks of multiple modalities, showing its superiority over various modality-specific and unified baselines.</description>

      <title>HONEYBEE: Efficient Role-based Access Control for Vector Databases via Dynamic Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enterprise deployments of vector databases require access control policies to protect sensitive data. These systems often implement access control through hybrid vector queries that combine nearest-neighbor search with relational predicates based on user permissions. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: dedicated per-user indexes minimize query latency but incur high memory redundancy, while shared indexes with post-search filtering reduce memory overhead at the cost of increased latency. This paper introduces HONEYBEE, a dynamic partitioning framework that leverages the structure of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies to create a smooth trade-off between these extremes. RBAC policies organize users into roles and assign permissions at the role level, creating a natural ``thin waist" in the permission structure that is ideal for partitioning decisions. Specifically, HONEYBEE produces overlapping partitions where vectors can be strategically replicated across different partitions to reduce query latency while controlling memory overhead. To guide these decisions, HONEYBEE develops analytical models of vector search performance and recall, and formulates partitioning as a constrained optimization problem that balances memory usage, query efficiency, and recall. Evaluations on RBAC workloads demonstrate that HONEYBEE achieves up to 13.5X lower query latency than row-level security with only a 1.24X increase in memory usage, while achieving comparable query performance to dedicated, per-role indexes with 90.4% reduction in additional memory consumption, offering a practical middle ground for secure and efficient vector search.</description>

      <title>Quantifying task-relevant representational similarity using decision variable correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have compared neural activities in the visual cortex to representations in deep neural networks trained on image classification. Interestingly, while some suggest that their representations are highly similar, others argued the opposite. Here, we propose a new approach to characterize the similarity of the decision strategies of two observers (models or brains) using decision variable correlation (DVC). DVC quantifies the image-by-image correlation between the decoded decisions based on the internal neural representations in a classification task. Thus, it can capture task-relevant information rather than general representational alignment. We evaluate DVC using monkey V4/IT recordings and network models trained on image classification tasks. We find that model-model similarity is comparable to monkey-monkey similarity, whereas model-monkey similarity is consistently lower. Strikingly, DVC decreases with increasing network performance on ImageNet-1k. Adversarial training does not improve model-monkey similarity in task-relevant dimensions assessed using DVC, although it markedly increases the model-model similarity. Similarly, pre-training on larger datasets does not improve model-monkey similarity. These results suggest a divergence between the task-relevant representations in monkey V4/IT and those learned by models trained on image classification tasks.</description>

      <title>TTrace: Lightweight Error Checking and Diagnosis for Distributed Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed training is essential for scaling the training of large neural network models, such as large language models (LLMs), across thousands of GPUs. However, the complexity of distributed training programs makes them particularly prone to silent bugs, which do not produce explicit error signals but lead to incorrect training outcomes. Effectively detecting and localizing such silent bugs in distributed training is challenging. Common debugging practices based on monitoring training loss or gradient norm curves are indirect, inefficient, and provide no way to localize bugs. To address those challenges, we design and implement TTrace, the first systematic differential testing system for detecting and localizing silent bugs in distributed training. TTrace aligns intermediate tensors from distributed training with those from a trusted reference implementation. To properly compare the floating-point values in the corresponding tensors, we propose a novel mathematical analysis that provides a guideline for setting tolerances, enabling TTrace to distinguish bug-induced errors from numerical errors. Experimental results demonstrate that TTrace effectively detects 11 existing bugs and 3 new bugs in the widely used Megatron-LM framework, while requiring fewer than 10 lines of code changes. TTrace is effective in various training recipes, including low-precision recipes involving BF16 and FP8. Notably, a popular open-source training framework has already adopted the method proposed by TTrace in its development workflow.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Action: Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Chain-of-Action (CoA), a novel visuo-motor policy paradigm built upon Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that predict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by explicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single autoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe action that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens are generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and previously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a global-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained by the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA incorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token representation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation; reverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk modeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial generalization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of a visuo-motor policy. Empirically, we observe CoA achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>SLR: Automated Synthesis for Scalable Logical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15787v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given a user's task specification, SLR automatically synthesizes (i) an instruction prompt for an inductive reasoning task, (ii) a validation program, executable on model outputs to provide verifiable rewards, and (iii) the latent ground-truth rule. This process is fully automated, scalable, requires no human annotations, and offers precise control over task difficulty. Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising 19k prompts organized into 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs demonstrate improved performance but incur very high test-time computation, with costs exceeding $300 for just 1,000 prompts. Finally, curriculum learning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. Moreover, these reasoning capabilities generalize to a wide range of established benchmarks, underscoring the effectiveness of SLR for downstream reasoning.</description>

      <title>Agent.xpu: Efficient Scheduling of Agentic LLM Workloads on Heterogeneous SoC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personal LLM agents increasingly combine foreground reactive interactions with background proactive monitoring, forming long-lived, stateful LLM flows that interleave prefill and token-by-token decode. While modern heterogeneous SoCs integrate CPUs, iGPUs, and NPUs to support on-device intelligence, existing LLM engines assume static, single-shot inference and lack mechanisms for flow-level concurrency, prioritization, and efficient accelerator coordination. As a result, commodity SoCs remain poorly matched to the dynamic, mixed-criticality execution patterns of personal agents.
  This paper presents Agent$.$xpu, the first LLM engine that orchestrates concurrent reactive and proactive LLM flows on commodity SoCs. Extensive profiling uncovers unique SoC characteristics of operator-accelerator affinity, asymmetric DDR contention, and stage-divergent batching behaviors distinct from cloud-serving assumptions. Agent$.$xpu introduces three key techniques: a heterogeneous execution graph (HEG) capturing NPU/iGPU affinity and elastic operator binding; flow-aware NPU-iGPU coordination with stage elasticity, decoupling prefill and decode to reduce bandwidth contention and enforce priorities; and fine-grained preemption with slack-aware piggybacking to guarantee reactive responsiveness without starving proactive work. Across realistic personal-agent workloads, Agent$.$xpu delivers 1.2-4.9$\times$ proactive throughput and reduces reactive latency by at least 91%, compared with both industrial iGPU-only serving engine and NPU-iGPU static inference with optimal tensor-partitioning schemes. Agent$.$xpu also minimizes energy consumption and graphics interference via controlled iGPU usage.</description>

      <title>Stable Preference Optimization: A Bilevel Approach to Catastrophic Preference Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Learning has emerged as a dominant offline paradigm for preference optimization. Most of these methods are based on the Bradley-Terry (BT) model for pairwise preference ranking, which directly aligns language model with human preference. Prior work has observed a counter-intuitive phenomenon termed likelihood displacement, where the absolute probability of preferred responses decreases simultaneously during training. We demonstrate that such displacement can lead to a more devastating failure mode, which we defined as \textit{Catastrophic Preference Shift}, where the lost preference probability mass inadvertently shifts toward out-of-distribution (OOD) responses. Such a failure mode is a key limitation shared across BT-style direct preference learning methods, due to the fundamental conflict between the unconstrained discriminative alignment and generative foundational capabilities, ultimately leading to severe performance degradation (e.g., SimPO suffers a significant drop in reasoning accuracy from 73.5\% to 37.5\%). We analyze existing BT-style methods from the probability evolution perspective and theoretically prove that these methods exhibit over-reliance on model initialization and can lead to preference shift. To resolve these counter-intuitive behaviors, we propose a theoretically grounded Stable Preference Optimization (SPO) framework that constrains preference learning within a safe alignment region. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SPO effectively stabilizes and enhances the performance of existing BT-style preference learning methods. SPO provides new insights into the design of preference learning objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and interpretable language model alignment.</description>

      <title>Compositional Discrete Latent Code for High Fidelity, Productive Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that diffusion models' success in modeling complex distributions is, for the most part, coming from their input conditioning. This paper investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation. We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally, we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples outside of the image generator training distribution.</description>

Abstract: H-theorem provides a microscopic foundation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and is therefore essential to establishing statistical physics, but at the same time, H-theorem has been subject to controversy that in part persists till this day. To better understand H-theorem and its relation to the arrow of time, we study the equilibration of randomly oriented and positioned hard disks with periodic boundary conditions. Using a model based on the DeepSets architecture, which imposes permutation invariance of the particle labels, we train a model to capture the irreversibility of the H-functional.</description>

      <title>VocabTailor: Dynamic Vocabulary Selection for Downstream Tasks in Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid, one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle, the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static vocabulary pruning.</description>

      <title>Scene-Aware Vectorized Memory Multi-Agent Framework with Cross-Modal Differentiated Quantization VLMs for Visually Impaired Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in environmental perception. Traditional assistive technologies often lack adaptive intelligence, focusing on individual components rather than integrated systems. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to richer, integrated understanding, their deployment is severely limited by substantial computational requirements, demanding dozens of gigabytes of memory. To address these gaps in computational efficiency and integrated design, this study proposes a dual technological innovation framework: a cross-modal differentiated quantization framework for VLMs and a scene-aware vectorized memory multi-agent system. The quantization framework implements differentiated strategies, reducing memory from 38GB to 11.3GB. The multi-agent system uses vectorized memory and perception-memory-reasoning workflows to provide environmental information beyond the current view, achieving 2.83-3.52s latency to initial speech output. Experiments show the quantized 19B-parameter model only experiences a 2.05% performance drop on MMBench and maintains 63.7 accuracy on OCR-VQA (original: 64.9), outperforming smaller models with equivalent memory. This research advances computational efficiency and assistive technology, offering comprehensive assistance in scene perception, text recognition, and navigation.</description>

      <title>Re3: Learning to Balance Relevance &amp; Recency for Temporal Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal Information Retrieval (TIR) is a critical yet unresolved task for modern search systems, retrieving documents that not only satisfy a query's information need but also adhere to its temporal constraints. This task is shaped by two challenges: Relevance, ensuring alignment with the query's explicit temporal requirements, and Recency, selecting the freshest document among multiple versions. Existing methods often address the two challenges in isolation, relying on brittle heuristics that fail in scenarios where temporal requirements and staleness resistance are intertwined. To address this gap, we introduce Re2Bench, a benchmark specifically designed to disentangle and evaluate Relevance, Recency, and their hybrid combination. Building on this foundation, we propose Re3, a unified and lightweight framework that dynamically balances semantic and temporal information through a query-aware gating mechanism. On Re2Bench, Re3 achieves state-of-the-art results, leading in R@1 across all three subsets. Ablation studies with backbone sensitivity tests confirm robustness, showing strong generalization across diverse encoders and real-world settings. This work provides both a generalizable solution and a principled evaluation suite, advancing the development of temporally aware retrieval systems. Re3 and Re2Bench are available online: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Re3-0C5A</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03219v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive exploration methods propose ways to learn complex policies via alternating between exploration and exploitation. An important question for such methods is to determine the appropriate moment to switch between exploration and exploitation and vice versa. This is critical in domains that require the learning of long and complex sequences of actions. In this work, we present a generic adaptive exploration framework that employs uncertainty to address this important issue in a principled manner. Our framework includes previous adaptive exploration approaches as special cases. Moreover, we can incorporate in our framework any uncertainty-measuring mechanism of choice, for instance mechanisms used in intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty-based exploration methods. We experimentally demonstrate that our framework gives rise to adaptive exploration strategies that outperform standard ones across several environments.</description>

      <title>Personality-Enhanced Social Recommendations in SAMI: Exploring the Role of Personality Detection in Matchmaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social belonging is a vital part of learning, yet online course environments present barriers to the organic formation of social groups. SAMI (Social Agent Mediated Interactions) offers one solution by facilitating student connections, but its effectiveness may be constrained by an incomplete Theory of Mind, limiting its ability to create an effective 'mental model' of a student. One facet of this is its inability to intuit personality, which may influence the relevance of its recommendations.
  To explore this gap, we examine the viability of automated personality inference by proposing a personality detection model utilizing GPT's zeroshot capability to infer Big-Five personality traits from forum introduction posts, often encouraged in online courses. We benchmark its performance against established models, finding that while GPT models show promising results on this specific dataset, performance varies significantly across traits. We identify potential biases toward optimistic trait inference, particularly for traits with skewed distributions.
  We demonstrate a proof-of-concept integration of personality detection into SAMI's entity-based matchmaking system, focusing on three traits with established connections to positive social formation: Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Openness. This work represents an initial exploration of personality-informed social recommendations in educational settings. While our implementation shows technical feasibility, significant questions remain. We discuss these limitations and outline directions for future work, examining what LLMs specifically capture when performing personality inference and whether personality-based matching meaningfully improves student connections in practice.</description>

      <title>ImageNet-trained CNNs are not biased towards texture: Revisiting feature reliance through controlled suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20234v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently texture-biased has shaped much of the discourse on feature use in deep learning. We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless, this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape, medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a stronger reliance on texture.

      <title>Agentic Additive Manufacturing Alloy Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agentic systems enable the intelligent use of research tooling, augmenting a researcher's ability to investigate and propose novel solutions to existing problems. Within Additive Manufacturing (AM), alloy selection and evaluation remains a complex challenge, often requiring expertise in the various domains of materials science, thermodynamic simulations, and experimental analysis. Large Language Model (LLM) enabled agents can facilitate this endeavor by utilizing their extensive knowledge base to dispatch tool calls via Model Context Protocol (MCP) to perform actions such as thermophysical property diagram calculations and lack of fusion process map generation. In addition, the multi-agent system can effectively reason through complex user prompts and provide analysis on the lack of fusion process window of common alloys such as SS316L and IN718 along with proposed composition variants of known alloys. These agents can dynamically adjust their task trajectory to the outcomes of tool call results, effectively enabling autonomous decision-making in practical environments. This work aims to showcase the benefits of adopting a LLM enabled multi-agent system to automate and accelerate the task of evaluating proposed additive manufacturing alloys, both novel and known.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce CodeEvolve, an open-source framework that combines large language models (LLMs) with evolutionary search to synthesize high-performing algorithmic solutions. CodeEvolve couples an islands-based genetic algorithm with modular LLM orchestration, using execution feedback and task-specific metrics to guide selection and variation. Exploration and exploitation are balanced through context-aware recombination, adaptive meta-prompting, and targeted refinement of promising solutions. We evaluate CodeEvolve on benchmarks previously used to assess Google DeepMind's AlphaEvolve, showing superior performance on several tasks and competitive results overall. Notably, open-weight models often match or exceed closed-source baselines at a fraction of the compute cost. We provide extensive ablations analyzing the contribution of each component and release our framework and experimental results at https://github.com/inter-co/science-codeevolve.</description>

      <title>Iterative Topic Taxonomy Induction with LLMs: A Case Study of Electoral Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping political discourse, but analyzing their vast and rapidly evolving content remains a major challenge. We introduce an end-to-end framework for automatically inducing an interpretable topic taxonomy from unlabeled text corpora. By combining unsupervised clustering with prompt-based inference, our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to iteratively construct a taxonomy without requiring seed sets (predefined labels) or domain expertise. We validate the framework through a study of political advertising ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The induced taxonomy yields semantically rich topic labels and supports downstream analyses, including moral framing, in this setting. Results suggest that structured, iterative labeling yields more consistent and interpretable topic labels than existing approaches under human evaluation, and is practical for analyzing large-scale political advertising data.</description>

      <title>Error analysis of a compositional score-based algorithm for simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) has become a widely used framework in applied sciences for estimating the parameters of stochastic models that best explain experimental observations. A central question in this setting is how to effectively combine multiple observations in order to improve parameter inference and obtain sharper posterior distributions. Recent advances in score-based diffusion methods address this problem by constructing a compositional score, obtained by aggregating individual posterior scores within the diffusion process. While it is natural to suspect that the accumulation of individual errors may significantly degrade sampling quality as the number of observations grows, this important theoretical issue has so far remained unexplored. In this paper, we study the compositional score produced by the GAUSS algorithm of Linhart et al. (2024) and establish an upper bound on its mean squared error in terms of both the individual score errors and the number of observations. We illustrate our theoretical findings on a Gaussian example, where all analytical expressions can be derived in a closed form.</description>

      <title>ReCode: Unify Plan and Action for Universal Granularity Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23564v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization. We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action, enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity. Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich, multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/ReCode.</description>

      <title>Source-Optimal Training is Transfer-Suboptimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08401v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that training a source model optimally for its own task is generically suboptimal when the objective is downstream transfer. We study the source-side optimization problem in L2-SP ridge regression and show a fundamental mismatch between the source-optimal and transfer-optimal source regularization: outside of a measure-zero set, $\tau_0^* \neq \tau_S^*$. We characterize the transfer-optimal source penalty $\tau_0^*$ as a function of task alignment and identify an alignment-dependent reversal: with imperfect alignment ($0&lt;\rho&lt;1$), transfer benefits from stronger source regularization, while in super-aligned regimes ($\rho&gt;1$), transfer benefits from weaker regularization. Additionally, in isotropic settings, the decision of whether transfer helps is independent of the target sample size and noise, depending only on task alignment and source characteristics. We verify the linear predictions in a synthetic ridge regression experiment, and we present experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and 20 Newsgroups as evidence that the source-optimal versus transfer-optimal mismatch persists in standard nonlinear transfer learning pipelines.</description>

      <title>LORE: A Large Generative Model for Search Relevance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achievement. We introduce LORE, a systematic framework for Large Generative Model-based relevance in e-commerce search. Deployed and iterated over three years, LORE achieves a cumulative +27\% improvement in online GoodRate metrics. This report shares the valuable experience gained throughout its development lifecycle, spanning data, features, training, evaluation, and deployment. Insight. While existing works apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to enhance relevance, they often hit a performance ceiling. We argue this stems from treating relevance as a monolithic task, lacking principled deconstruction. Our key insight is that relevance comprises distinct capabilities: knowledge and reasoning, multi-modal matching, and rule adherence. We contend that a qualitative-driven decomposition is essential for breaking through current performance bottlenecks. Contributions. LORE provides a complete blueprint for the LLM relevance lifecycle. Key contributions include: (1) A two-stage training paradigm combining progressive CoT synthesis via SFT with human preference alignment via RL. (2) A comprehensive benchmark, RAIR, designed to evaluate these core capabilities. (3) A query frequency-stratified deployment strategy that efficiently transfers offline LLM capabilities to the online system. LORE serves as both a practical solution and a methodological reference for other vertical domains.</description>

      <title>Neuronal Attention Circuit (NAC) for Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attention improves representation learning over RNNs, but its discrete nature limits continuous-time (CT) modeling. We introduce Neuronal Attention Circuit (NAC), a novel, biologically inspired CT-Attention mechanism that reformulates attention logit computation as the solution to a linear first-order ODE with nonlinear interlinked gates derived from repurposing C.elegans Neuronal Circuit Policies (NCPs) wiring. NAC replaces dense projections with sparse sensory gates for key-query projections and a sparse backbone network with two heads for computing content-target and learnable time-constant gates, enabling efficient adaptive dynamics. To improve efficiency and memory consumption, we implemented an adaptable subquadratic sparse Top-K pairwise concatenation mechanism that selectively curates key-query interactions. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including state stability and bounded approximation errors. Empirically, we implemented NAC in diverse domains, including irregular time-series classification, lane-keeping for autonomous vehicles, and industrial prognostics. We observed that NAC matches or outperforms competing baselines in accuracy and occupies an intermediate position in runtime and memory consumption compared with several CT state-of-the-art baselines, while being interpretable at the neuron cell level.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Gemini Robotics Policies in a Veo World Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative world models hold significant potential for simulating interactions with visuomotor policies in varied environments. Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator.</description>

      <title>Activation Oracles: Training and Evaluating LLMs as General-Purpose Activation Explainers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) activations are notoriously difficult to understand, with most existing techniques using complex, specialized methods for interpreting them. Recent work has proposed a simpler approach known as LatentQA: training LLMs to directly accept LLM activations as inputs and answer arbitrary questions about them in natural language. However, prior work has focused on narrow task settings for both training and evaluation. In this paper, we instead take a generalist perspective. We evaluate LatentQA-trained models, which we call Activation Oracles (AOs), in far out-of-distribution settings and examine how performance scales with training data diversity. We find that AOs can recover information fine-tuned into a model (e.g., biographical knowledge or malign propensities) that does not appear in the input text, despite never being trained with activations from a fine-tuned model. Our main evaluations are four downstream tasks where we can compare to prior white- and black-box techniques. We find that even narrowly-trained LatentQA models can generalize well, and that adding additional training datasets (such as classification tasks and a self-supervised context prediction task) yields consistent further improvements. Our best AOs match or exceed white-box baselines on all four tasks and the best overall baseline on 3 of 4. These results suggest that diversified training to answer natural-language queries imparts a general capability to verbalize information about LLM activations.</description>

      <title>ORPR: An OR-Guided Pretrain-then-Reinforce Learning Model for Inventory Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the pursuit of synergy between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Operations Research (OR) gains momentum in handling complex inventory systems, a critical challenge persists: how to effectively reconcile AI's adaptive perception with OR's structural rigor. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel OR-Guided "Pretrain-then-Reinforce" framework. To provide structured guidance, we propose a simulation-augmented OR model that generates high-quality reference decisions, implicitly capturing complex business constraints and managerial preferences. Leveraging these OR-derived decisions as foundational training labels, we design a domain-informed deep learning foundation model to establish foundational decision-making capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning stage. Uniquely, we position RL as a deep alignment mechanism that enables the AI agent to internalize the optimality principles of OR, while simultaneously leveraging exploration for general policy refinement and allowing expert guidance for scenario-specific adaptation (e.g., promotional events). Validated through extensive numerical experiments and a field deployment at JD.com augmented by a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis, our model significantly outperforms incumbent industrial practices, delivering real-world gains of a 5.27-day reduction in turnover and a 2.29% increase in in-stock rates, alongside a 29.95% decrease in holding costs. Contrary to the prevailing trend of brute-force model scaling, our study demonstrates that a lightweight, domain-informed model can deliver state-of-the-art performance and robust transferability when guided by structured OR logic. This approach offers a scalable and cost-effective paradigm for intelligent supply chain management, highlighting the value of deeply aligning AI with OR.</description>

      <title>SmartSnap: Proactive Evidence Seeking for Self-Verifying Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for the development of autonomous agents under complex GUI tasks, but its scalability remains severely hampered by the verification of task completion. Existing task verification is treated as a passive, post-hoc process: a verifier (i.e., rule-based scoring script, reward or critic model, and LLM-as-a-Judge) analyzes the agent's entire interaction trajectory to determine if the agent succeeds. Such processing of verbose context that contains irrelevant, noisy history poses challenges to the verification protocols and therefore leads to prohibitive cost and low reliability. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SmartSnap, a paradigm shift from this passive, post-hoc verification to proactive, in-situ self-verification by the agent itself. We introduce the Self-Verifying Agent, a new type of agent designed with dual missions: to not only complete a task but also to prove its accomplishment with curated snapshot evidences. Guided by our proposed 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, and Creativity), the agent leverages its accessibility to the online environment to perform self-verification on a minimal, decisive set of snapshots. Such evidences are provided as the sole materials for a general LLM-as-a-Judge verifier to determine their validity and relevance. Experiments on mobile tasks across model families and scales demonstrate that our SmartSnap paradigm allows training LLM-driven agents in a scalable manner, bringing performance gains up to 26.08% and 16.66% respectively to 8B and 30B models. The synergizing between solution finding and evidence seeking facilitates the cultivation of efficient, self-verifying agents with competitive performance against DeepSeek V3.1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B.

      <title>Agentic Physical AI toward a Domain-Specific Foundation Model for Nuclear Reactor Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prevailing paradigm in AI for physical systems, scaling general-purpose foundation models toward universal multimodal reasoning, confronts a fundamental barrier at the control interface. Recent benchmarks show that even frontier vision-language models achieve only 50-53% accuracy on basic quantitative physics tasks, behaving as approximate guessers that preserve semantic plausibility while violating physical constraints. This input unfaithfulness is not a scaling deficiency but a structural limitation. Perception-centric architectures optimize parameter-space imitation, whereas safety-critical control demands outcome-space guarantees over executed actions. Here, we present a fundamentally different pathway toward domain-specific foundation models by introducing compact language models operating as Agentic Physical AI, in which policy optimization is driven by physics-based validation rather than perceptual inference. We train a 360-million-parameter model on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling the dataset from 10^3 to 10^5 examples. This induces a sharp phase transition absent in general-purpose models. Small-scale systems exhibit high-variance imitation with catastrophic tail risk, while large-scale models undergo variance collapse exceeding 500x reduction, stabilizing execution-level behavior. Despite balanced exposure to four actuation families, the model autonomously rejects approximately 70% of the training distribution and concentrates 95% of runtime execution on a single-bank strategy. Learned representations transfer across distinct physics and continuous input modalities without architectural modification.</description>

      <title>DarkEQA: Benchmarking Vision-Language Models for Embodied Question Answering in Low-Light Indoor Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted as central reasoning modules for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Project website: https://darkeqa-benchmark.github.io/</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Production LLM agents with tool-using capabilities require security testing despite their safety training. We adapt Go-Explore to evaluate GPT-4o-mini across 28 experimental runs spanning six research questions. We find that random-seed variance dominates algorithmic parameters, yielding an 8x spread in outcomes; single-seed comparisons are unreliable, while multi-seed averaging materially reduces variance in our setup. Reward shaping consistently harms performance, causing exploration collapse in 94% of runs or producing 18 false positives with zero verified attacks. In our environment, simple state signatures outperform complex ones. For comprehensive security testing, ensembles provide attack-type diversity, whereas single agents optimize coverage within a given attack type. Overall, these results suggest that seed variance and targeted domain knowledge can outweigh algorithmic sophistication when testing safety-trained models.</description>

      <title>Making MoE-based LLM Inference Resilient with Tarragon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are increasingly used to serve LLMs at scale, but failures become common as deployment scale grows. Existing systems exhibit poor failure resilience: even a single worker failure triggers a coarse-grained, service-wide restart, discarding accumulated progress and halting the entire inference pipeline during recovery--an approach clearly ill-suited for latency-sensitive, LLM services.
  We present Tarragon, a resilient MoE inference framework that confines the failures impact to individual workers while allowing the rest of the pipeline to continue making forward progress. Tarragon exploits the natural separation between the attention and expert computation in MoE-based transformers, treating attention workers (AWs) and expert workers (EWs) as distinct failure domains. Tarragon introduces a reconfigurable datapath to mask failures by rerouting requests to healthy workers. On top of this datapath, Tarragon implements a self-healing mechanism that relaxes the tightly synchronized execution of existing MoE frameworks. For stateful AWs, Tarragon performs asynchronous, incremental KV cache checkpointing with per-request restoration, and for stateless EWs, it leverages residual GPU memory to deploy shadow experts. These together keep recovery cost and recomputation overhead extremely low. Our evaluation shows that, compared to state-of-the-art MegaScale-Infer, Tarragon reduces failure-induced stalls by 160-213x (from ~64 s down to 0.3-0.4 s) while preserving performance when no failures occur.</description>

      <title>Modeling Information Blackouts in Missing Not-At-Random Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale traffic forecasting relies on fixed sensor networks that often exhibit blackouts: contiguous intervals of missing measurements caused by detector or communication failures. These outages are typically handled under a Missing At Random (MAR) assumption, even though blackout events may correlate with unobserved traffic conditions (e.g., congestion or anomalous flow), motivating a Missing Not At Random (MNAR) treatment. We propose a latent state-space framework that jointly models (i) traffic dynamics via a linear dynamical system and (ii) sensor dropout via a Bernoulli observation channel whose probability depends on the latent traffic state. Inference uses an Extended Kalman Filter with Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoothing, and parameters are learned via an approximate EM procedure with a dedicated update for detector-specific missingness parameters. On the Seattle inductive loop detector data, introducing latent dynamics yields large gains over naive baselines, reducing blackout imputation RMSE from 7.02 (LOCF) and 5.02 (linear interpolation + seasonal naive) to 4.23 (MAR LDS), corresponding to about a 64% reduction in MSE relative to LOCF. Explicit MNAR modeling provides a consistent but smaller additional improvement on real data (imputation RMSE 4.20; 0.8% RMSE reduction relative to MAR), with similar modest gains for short-horizon post-blackout forecasts (evaluated at 1, 3, and 6 steps). In controlled synthetic experiments, the MNAR advantage increases as the true missingness dependence on latent state strengthens. Overall, temporal dynamics dominate performance, while MNAR modeling offers a principled refinement that becomes most valuable when missingness is genuinely informative.</description>

      <title>MDAgent2: Large Language Model for Code Generation and Knowledge Q&amp;A in Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for understanding atomic-scale behaviors in materials science, yet writing LAMMPS scripts remains highly specialized and time-consuming tasks. Although LLMs show promise in code generation and domain-specific question answering, their performance in MD scenarios is limited by scarce domain data, the high deployment cost of state-of-the-art LLMs, and low code executability. Building upon our prior MDAgent, we present MDAgent2, the first end-to-end framework capable of performing both knowledge Q&amp;A and code generation within the MD domain. We construct a domain-specific data-construction pipeline that yields three high-quality datasets spanning MD knowledge, question answering, and code generation. Based on these datasets, we adopt a three stage post-training strategy--continued pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL)--to train two domain-adapted models, MD-Instruct and MD-Code. Furthermore, we introduce MD-GRPO, a closed-loop RL method that leverages simulation outcomes as reward signals and recycles low-reward trajectories for continual refinement. We further build MDAgent2-RUNTIME, a deployable multi-agent system that integrates code generation, execution, evaluation, and self-correction. Together with MD-EvalBench proposed in this work, the first benchmark for LAMMPS code generation and question answering, our models and system achieve performance surpassing several strong baselines.This work systematically demonstrates the adaptability and generalization capability of large language models in industrial simulation tasks, laying a methodological foundation for automatic code generation in AI for Science and industrial-scale simulations.
