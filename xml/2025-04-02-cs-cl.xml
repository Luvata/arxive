      <title>Fragile Mastery: Are Domain-Specific Trade-Offs Undermining On-Device Language Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of on-device language models (ODLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices is a multi-dimensional problem that strikes a fine balance between computational effectiveness, memory, power usage, and linguistic capacity across heterogeneous tasks. This holistic study conducts a thorough investigation of the trade-offs between domain-specific optimization and cross-domain robustness, culminating in the proposal of the Generalized Edge Model (GEM), a new architecture that aims to balance specialization and generalization in a harmonious manner. With a rigorous experimental approach testing 47 well-chosen benchmarks in eight domains--healthcare, law, finance, STEM, commonsense, conversational AI, multilingual, and domain-adaptive tasks--we show that conventional optimization techniques decrease target task perplexity by 18-25% but result in a precipitous decline in general-task performance with F1 scores decreasing by 12-29%, as reported by Liu et al. GEM employs a Sparse Cross-Attention Router (SCAR) to dynamically allocate computation to a variable number of computing resources with a cross-domain F1 accuracy of 0.89 on less than 100ms latency across Raspberry Pi 4, Pixel 6, iPhone 13, and bespoke custom neural processing units (NPUs). Compared to GPT-4 Lite, GEM enhances the general-task level by 7% with respect and parity in domain-specific performance. We propose three new measurement tools--Domain Specialization Index (DSI), Generalization Gap (GG), and Cross-Domain Transfer Ratio (CDTR)--which show strong correlation between model compression intensity and brittleness.</description>

      <title>TRIDIS: A Comprehensive Medieval and Early Modern Corpus for HTR and NER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces TRIDIS (Tria Digita Scribunt), an open-source corpus of medieval and early modern manuscripts. TRIDIS aggregates multiple legacy collections (all published under open licenses) and incorporates large metadata descriptions. While prior publications referenced some portions of this corpus, here we provide a unified overview with a stronger focus on its constitution. We describe (i) the narrative, chronological, and editorial background of each major sub-corpus, (ii) its semi-diplomatic transcription rules (expansion, normalization, punctuation), (iii) a strategy for challenging out-of-domain test splits driven by outlier detection in a joint embedding space, and (iv) preliminary baseline experiments using TrOCR and MiniCPM2.5 comparing random and outlier-based test partitions. Overall, TRIDIS is designed to stimulate joint robust Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) research across medieval and early modern textual heritage.</description>

      <title>A Large-Scale Vision-Language Dataset Derived from Open Scientific Literature to Advance Biomedical Generalist AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the excitement behind biomedical artificial intelligence (AI), access to high-quality, diverse, and large-scale data - the foundation for modern AI systems - is still a bottleneck to unlocking its full potential. To address this gap, we introduce Biomedica, an open-source dataset derived from the PubMed Central Open Access subset, containing over 6 million scientific articles and 24 million image-text pairs, along with 27 metadata fields (including expert human annotations). To overcome the challenges of accessing our large-scale dataset, we provide scalable streaming and search APIs through a web server, facilitating seamless integration with AI systems. We demonstrate the utility of the Biomedica dataset by building embedding models, chat-style models, and retrieval-augmented chat agents. Notably, all our AI models surpass previous open systems in their respective categories, underscoring the critical role of diverse, high-quality, and large-scale biomedical data.</description>

      <title>Susceptibility of Large Language Models to User-Driven Factors in Medical Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in healthcare, but their reliability is heavily influenced by user-driven factors such as question phrasing and the completeness of clinical information. In this study, we examined how misinformation framing, source authority, model persona, and omission of key clinical details affect the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of LLM outputs. We conducted two experiments: one introducing misleading external opinions with varying assertiveness (perturbation test), and another removing specific categories of patient information (ablation test). Using public datasets (MedQA and Medbullets), we evaluated proprietary models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash) and open-source models (LLaMA 3 8B, LLaMA 3 Med42 8B, DeepSeek R1 8B). All models were vulnerable to user-driven misinformation, with proprietary models especially affected by definitive and authoritative language. Assertive tone had the greatest negative impact on accuracy. In the ablation test, omitting physical exam findings and lab results caused the most significant performance drop. Although proprietary models had higher baseline accuracy, their performance declined sharply under misinformation. These results highlight the need for well-structured prompts and complete clinical context. Users should avoid authoritative framing of misinformation and provide full clinical details, especially for complex cases.</description>

      <title>Boosting Large Language Models with Mask Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The model is usually kept integral in the mainstream large language model (LLM) fine-tuning protocols. No works have questioned whether maintaining the integrity of the model is indispensable for performance. In this work, we introduce Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT), a brand-new LLM fine-tuning paradigm to show that properly breaking the integrity of the model can surprisingly lead to improved performance. Specifically, MFT learns a set of binary masks supervised by the typical LLM fine-tuning objective. Extensive experiments show that MFT gains a consistent performance boost across various domains and backbones (e.g., 1.95%/1.88% average gain in coding with LLaMA2-7B/3.1-8B). Detailed procedures are provided to study the proposed MFT from different hyperparameter perspectives for better insight. In particular, MFT naturally updates the current LLM training protocol by deploying it on a complete well-trained model. This study extends the functionality of mask learning from its conventional network pruning context for model compression to a more general scope.</description>

      <title>Learning to Reason for Long-Form Story Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating high-quality stories spanning thousands of tokens requires competency across a variety of skills, from tracking plot and character arcs to keeping a consistent and engaging style. Due to the difficulty of sourcing labeled datasets and precise quality measurements, most work using large language models (LLMs) for long-form story generation uses combinations of hand-designed prompting techniques to elicit author-like behavior. This is a manual process that is highly dependent on the specific story-generation task. Motivated by the recent success of applying RL with Verifiable Rewards to domains like math and coding, we propose a general story-generation task (Next-Chapter Prediction) and a reward formulation (Verified Rewards via Completion Likelihood Improvement) that allows us to use an unlabeled book dataset as a learning signal for reasoning. We learn to reason over a story's condensed information and generate a detailed plan for the next chapter. Our reasoning is evaluated via the chapters it helps a story-generator create, and compared against non-trained and supervised finetuning (SFT) baselines. Pairwise human judgments reveal the chapters our learned reasoning produces are preferred across almost all metrics, and the effect is more pronounced in Scifi and Fantasy genres.</description>

      <title>Generating Synthetic Oracle Datasets to Analyze Noise Impact: A Study on Building Function Classification Using Tweets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tweets provides valuable semantic context for earth observation tasks and serves as a complementary modality to remote sensing imagery. In building function classification (BFC), tweets are often collected using geographic heuristics and labeled via external databases, an inherently weakly supervised process that introduces both label noise and sentence level feature noise (e.g., irrelevant or uninformative tweets). While label noise has been widely studied, the impact of sentence level feature noise remains underexplored, largely due to the lack of clean benchmark datasets for controlled analysis. In this work, we propose a method for generating a synthetic oracle dataset using LLM, designed to contain only tweets that are both correctly labeled and semantically relevant to their associated buildings. This oracle dataset enables systematic investigation of noise impacts that are otherwise difficult to isolate in real-world data. To assess its utility, we compare model performance using Naive Bayes and mBERT classifiers under three configurations: real vs. synthetic training data, and cross-domain generalization. Results show that noise in real tweets significantly degrades the contextual learning capacity of mBERT, reducing its performance to that of a simple keyword-based model. In contrast, the clean synthetic dataset allows mBERT to learn effectively, outperforming Naive Bayes Bayes by a large margin. These findings highlight that addressing feature noise is more critical than model complexity in this task. Our synthetic dataset offers a novel experimental environment for future noise injection studies and is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Understanding Inequality of LLM Fact-Checking over Geographic Regions with Agent and Retrieval models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fact-checking is a potentially useful application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to combat the growing dissemination of disinformation. However, the performance of LLMs varies across geographic regions. In this paper, we evaluate the factual accuracy of open and private models across a diverse set of regions and scenarios.
  Using a dataset containing 600 fact-checked statements balanced across six global regions we examine three experimental setups of fact-checking a statement: (1) when just the statement is available, (2) when an LLM-based agent with Wikipedia access is utilized, and (3) as a best case scenario when a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system provided with the official fact check is employed. Our findings reveal that regardless of the scenario and LLM used, including GPT-4, Claude Sonnet, and LLaMA, statements from the Global North perform substantially better than those from the Global South. Furthermore, this gap is broadened for the more realistic case of a Wikipedia agent-based system, highlighting that overly general knowledge bases have a limited ability to address region-specific nuances. These results underscore the urgent need for better dataset balancing and robust retrieval strategies to enhance LLM fact-checking capabilities, particularly in geographically diverse contexts.</description>

      <title>Resona: Improving Context Copying in Linear Recurrence Models with Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent shifts in the space of large language model (LLM) research have shown an increasing focus on novel architectures to compete with prototypical Transformer-based models that have long dominated this space. Linear recurrent models have proven to be a viable competitor due to their computational efficiency. However, such models still demonstrate a sizable gap compared to Transformers in terms of in-context learning among other tasks that require recalling information from a context. In this work, we introduce __Resona__, a simple and scalable framework for augmenting linear recurrent models with retrieval. __Resona__~augments models with the ability to integrate retrieved information from the provided input context, enabling tailored behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments on a variety of linear recurrent models demonstrate that __Resona__-augmented models observe significant performance gains on a variety of synthetic as well as real-world natural language tasks, highlighting its ability to act as a general purpose method to improve the in-context learning and language modeling abilities of linear recurrent LLMs.</description>

      <title>SUV: Scalable Large Language Model Copyright Compliance with Regularized Selective Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing by learning from massive datasets, yet this rapid progress has also drawn legal scrutiny, as the ability to unintentionally generate copyrighted content has already prompted several prominent lawsuits. In this work, we introduce SUV (Selective Unlearning for Verbatim data), a selective unlearning framework designed to prevent LLM from memorizing copyrighted content while preserving its overall utility. In detail, the proposed method constructs a dataset that captures instances of copyrighted infringement cases by the targeted LLM. With the dataset, we unlearn the content from the LLM by means of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which replaces the verbatim copyrighted content with plausible and coherent alternatives. Since DPO may hinder the LLM's performance in other unrelated tasks, we integrate gradient projection and Fisher information regularization to mitigate the degradation. We validate our approach using a large-scale dataset of 500 famous books (predominantly copyrighted works) and demonstrate that SUV significantly reduces verbatim memorization with negligible impact on the performance on unrelated tasks. Extensive experiments on both our dataset and public benchmarks confirm the scalability and efficacy of our approach, offering a promising solution for mitigating copyright risks in real-world LLM applications.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Support Medical Knowledge Imputation? An Evaluation-Based Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical knowledge graphs (KGs) are essential for clinical decision support and biomedical research, yet they often exhibit incompleteness due to knowledge gaps and structural limitations in medical coding systems. This issue is particularly evident in treatment mapping, where coding systems such as ICD, Mondo, and ATC lack comprehensive coverage, resulting in missing or inconsistent associations between diseases and their potential treatments. To address this issue, we have explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for imputing missing treatment relationships. Although LLMs offer promising capabilities in knowledge augmentation, their application in medical knowledge imputation presents significant risks, including factual inaccuracies, hallucinated associations, and instability between and within LLMs. In this study, we systematically evaluate LLM-driven treatment mapping, assessing its reliability through benchmark comparisons. Our findings highlight critical limitations, including inconsistencies with established clinical guidelines and potential risks to patient safety. This study serves as a cautionary guide for researchers and practitioners, underscoring the importance of critical evaluation and hybrid approaches when leveraging LLMs to enhance treatment mappings on medical knowledge graphs.</description>

      <title>XL-Instruct: Synthetic Data for Cross-Lingual Open-Ended Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-lingual open-ended generation -- i.e. generating responses in a desired language different from that of the user's query -- is an important yet understudied problem. We introduce XL-AlpacaEval, a new benchmark for evaluating cross-lingual generation capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), and propose XL-Instruct, a high-quality synthetic data generation method. Fine-tuning with just 8K XL-Instruct-generated instructions significantly improves model performance, increasing the win rate against GPT-4o-Mini from 7.4% to 21.5%, and improving on several fine-grained quality metrics. Additionally, models fine-tuned on XL-Instruct exhibit strong zero-shot transfer to both English-only and multilingual generation tasks. Given its consistent gains across the board, we strongly recommend incorporating XL-Instruct in the post-training pipeline of future multilingual LLMs. To facilitate further research, we will publicly and freely release the XL-Instruct and XL-AlpacaEval datasets, which constitute two of the few cross-lingual resources currently available in the literature.</description>

      <title>FReM: A Flexible Reasoning Mechanism for Balancing Quick and Slow Thinking in Long-Context Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-context question-answering (LCQA) systems have greatly benefited from the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), which can be categorized into slow and quick reasoning modes. However, both modes have their limitations. Slow thinking generally leans to explore every possible reasoning path, which leads to heavy overthinking and wastes time. Quick thinking usually relies on pattern matching rather than truly understanding the query logic, which misses proper understanding. To address these issues, we propose FReM: Flexible Reasoning Mechanism, a method that adjusts reasoning depth according to the complexity of each question. Specifically, FReM leverages synthetic reference QA examples to provide an explicit chain of thought, enabling efficient handling of simple queries while allowing deeper reasoning for more complex ones. By doing so, FReM helps quick-thinking models move beyond superficial pattern matching and narrows the reasoning space for slow-thinking models to avoid unnecessary exploration. Experiments on seven QA datasets show that FReM improves reasoning accuracy and scalability, particularly for complex multihop questions, indicating its potential to advance LCQA methodologies.</description>

      <title>Sparse Mixture of Experts as Unified Competitive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) improves the efficiency of large language model training by directing input tokens to a subset of experts. Despite its success in generation tasks, its generalization ability remains an open question. In this paper, we demonstrate that current SMoEs, which fall into two categories: (1) Token Choice ;and (2) Expert Choice, struggle with tasks such as the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). By analyzing their mechanism through the lens of competitive learning, our study finds that the Token Choice approach may overly focus on irrelevant experts, while the Expert Choice approach risks discarding important tokens, potentially affecting performance. Motivated by this analysis, we propose Unified Competitive Learning SMoE (USMoE), a novel and efficient framework designed to improve the performance of existing SMoEs in both scenarios: with and without training. Extensive experiments across various tasks show that USMoE achieves up to a 10% improvement over traditional approaches or reduces computational inference costs by 14% while maintaining strong performance.</description>

      <title>S2MoE: Robust Sparse Mixture of Experts via Stochastic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) enables efficient training of large language models by routing input tokens to a select number of experts. However, training SMoE remains challenging due to the issue of representation collapse. Recent studies have focused on improving the router to mitigate this problem, but existing approaches face two key limitations: (1) expert embeddings are significantly smaller than the model's dimension, contributing to representation collapse, and (2) routing each input to the Top-K experts can cause them to learn overly similar features. In this work, we propose a novel approach called Robust Sparse Mixture of Experts via Stochastic Learning (S2MoE), which is a mixture of experts designed to learn from both deterministic and non-deterministic inputs via Learning under Uncertainty. Extensive experiments across various tasks demonstrate that S2MoE achieves performance comparable to other routing methods while reducing computational inference costs by 28%.</description>

      <title>A Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Mining Method with Deep Thinking LLMs for Biomedical Research and Clinical Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs and large language models (LLMs) are key tools for biomedical knowledge integration and reasoning, facilitating structured organization of scientific articles and discovery of complex semantic relationships. However, current methods face challenges: knowledge graph construction is limited by complex terminology, data heterogeneity, and rapid knowledge evolution, while LLMs show limitations in retrieval and reasoning, making it difficult to uncover cross-document associations and reasoning pathways. To address these issues, we propose a pipeline that uses LLMs to construct a biomedical knowledge graph (BioStrataKG) from large-scale articles and builds a cross-document question-answering dataset (BioCDQA) to evaluate latent knowledge retrieval and multi-hop reasoning. We then introduce Integrated and Progressive Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning (IP-RAR) to enhance retrieval accuracy and knowledge reasoning. IP-RAR maximizes information recall through Integrated Reasoning-based Retrieval and refines knowledge via Progressive Reasoning-based Generation, using self-reflection to achieve deep thinking and precise contextual understanding. Experiments show that IP-RAR improves document retrieval F1 score by 20\% and answer generation accuracy by 25\% over existing methods. This framework helps doctors efficiently integrate treatment evidence for personalized medication plans and enables researchers to analyze advancements and research gaps, accelerating scientific discovery and decision-making.</description>

      <title>A Training-free LLM Framework with Interaction between Contextually Related Subtasks in Solving Complex Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving complex tasks. Recent work has explored decomposing such tasks into subtasks with independent contexts. However, some contextually related subtasks may encounter information loss during execution, leading to redundant operations or execution failures. To address this issue, we propose a training-free framework with an interaction mechanism, which enables a subtask to query specific information or trigger certain actions in completed subtasks by sending requests. To implement interaction, we introduce a subtask trajectory memory to enable resumption of completed subtasks upon receiving interaction requests. Additionally, we propose a new action during execution, which generates a concise and precise description of execution process and outcomes of a subtask, to assist subsequent subtasks in determining interaction targets and requests. We evaluate our framework on interactive decision-making task WebShop and multi-hop question answering HotpotQA, with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and comparison results show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art training-free baselines.</description>

      <title>Efficient Inference for Large Reasoning Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) significantly improve the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning to reason, exhibiting promising performance in complex task-solving. However, their deliberative reasoning process leads to inefficiencies in token usage, memory consumption, and inference time. Thus, this survey provides a review of efficient inference methods designed specifically for LRMs, focusing on mitigating token inefficiency while preserving the reasoning quality. First, we introduce a taxonomy to group the recent methods into two main categories: (a) explicit compact Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which reduces tokens while keeping the explicit reasoning structure, and (b) implicit latent CoT, which encodes reasoning steps within hidden representations instead of explicit tokens. Meanwhile, we discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Then, we conduct empirical analyses on existing methods from performance and efficiency aspects. Besides, we present open challenges in this field, including human-centric controllable reasoning, trade-off between interpretability and efficiency of reasoning, ensuring safety of efficient reasoning, and broader applications of efficient reasoning. In addition, we highlight key insights for enhancing LRMs' inference efficiency via techniques such as model merging, new architectures, and agent routers. We hope this work serves as a valuable guide, helping researchers overcome challenges in this vibrant field\footnote{https://github.com/yueliu1999/Awesome-Efficient-Inference-for-LRMs}.</description>

      <title>EventWeave: A Dynamic Framework for Capturing Core and Supporting Events in Dialogue Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in dialogue systems. However, many approaches still overlook the fundamental role of events throughout multi-turn interactions, leading to \textbf{incomplete context tracking}. Without tracking these events, dialogue systems often lose coherence and miss subtle shifts in user intent, causing disjointed responses. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{EventWeave}, an event-centric framework that identifies and updates both core and supporting events as the conversation unfolds. Specifically, we organize these events into a dynamic event graph, which represents the interplay between \textbf{core events} that shape the primary idea and \textbf{supporting events} that provide critical context during the whole dialogue. By leveraging this dynamic graph, EventWeave helps models focus on the most relevant events when generating responses, thus avoiding repeated visits of the entire dialogue history. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that EventWeave improves response quality and event relevance without fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>The Reasoning-Memorization Interplay in Language Models Is Mediated by a Single Direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel on a variety of reasoning benchmarks, but previous studies suggest they sometimes struggle to generalize to unseen questions, potentially due to over-reliance on memorized training examples. However, the precise conditions under which LLMs switch between reasoning and memorization during text generation remain unclear. In this work, we provide a mechanistic understanding of LLMs' reasoning-memorization dynamics by identifying a set of linear features in the model's residual stream that govern the balance between genuine reasoning and memory recall. These features not only distinguish reasoning tasks from memory-intensive ones but can also be manipulated to causally influence model performance on reasoning tasks. Additionally, we show that intervening in these reasoning features helps the model more accurately activate the most relevant problem-solving capabilities during answer generation. Our findings offer new insights into the underlying mechanisms of reasoning and memory in LLMs and pave the way for the development of more robust and interpretable generative AI systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces UnityAI-Guard, a framework for binary toxicity classification targeting low-resource Indian languages. While existing systems predominantly cater to high-resource languages, UnityAI-Guard addresses this critical gap by developing state-of-the-art models for identifying toxic content across diverse Brahmic/Indic scripts. Our approach achieves an impressive average F1-score of 84.23% across seven languages, leveraging a dataset of 888k training instances and 35k manually verified test instances. By advancing multilingual content moderation for linguistically diverse regions, UnityAI-Guard also provides public API access to foster broader adoption and application.</description>

      <title>Parsing Through Boundaries in Chinese Word Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chinese word segmentation is a foundational task in natural language processing (NLP), with far-reaching effects on syntactic analysis. Unlike alphabetic languages like English, Chinese lacks explicit word boundaries, making segmentation both necessary and inherently ambiguous. This study highlights the intricate relationship between word segmentation and syntactic parsing, providing a clearer understanding of how different segmentation strategies shape dependency structures in Chinese. Focusing on the Chinese GSD treebank, we analyze multiple word boundary schemes, each reflecting distinct linguistic and computational assumptions, and examine how they influence the resulting syntactic structures. To support detailed comparison, we introduce an interactive web-based visualization tool that displays parsing outcomes across segmentation methods.</description>

      <title>Memory-Aware and Uncertainty-Guided Retrieval for Multi-Hop Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-hop question answering (QA) requires models to retrieve and reason over multiple pieces of evidence. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has made progress in this area, existing methods often suffer from two key limitations: (1) fixed or overly frequent retrieval steps, and (2) ineffective use of previously retrieved knowledge.
  We propose MIND (Memory-Informed and INteractive Dynamic RAG), a framework that addresses these challenges through: (i) prompt-based entity extraction to identify reasoning-relevant elements, (ii) dynamic retrieval triggering based on token-level entropy and attention signals, and (iii) memory-aware filtering, which stores high-confidence facts across reasoning steps to enable consistent multi-hop generation.</description>

      <title>The realization of tones in spontaneous spoken Taiwan Mandarin: a corpus-based survey and theory-driven computational modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing body of literature has demonstrated that semantics can co-determine fine phonetic detail. However, the complex interplay between phonetic realization and semantics remains understudied, particularly in pitch realization. The current study investigates the tonal realization of Mandarin disyllabic words with all 20 possible combinations of two tones, as found in a corpus of Taiwan Mandarin spontaneous speech. We made use of Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMs) to model f0 contours as a function of a series of predictors, including gender, tonal context, tone pattern, speech rate, word position, bigram probability, speaker and word. In the GAM analysis, word and sense emerged as crucial predictors of f0 contours, with effect sizes that exceed those of tone pattern. For each word token in our dataset, we then obtained a contextualized embedding by applying the GPT-2 large language model to the context of that token in the corpus. We show that the pitch contours of word tokens can be predicted to a considerable extent from these contextualized embeddings, which approximate token-specific meanings in contexts of use. The results of our corpus study show that meaning in context and phonetic realization are far more entangled than standard linguistic theory predicts.</description>

      <title>The Challenge of Achieving Attributability in Multilingual Table-to-Text Generation with Question-Answer Blueprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual Natural Language Generation (NLG) is challenging due to the lack of training data for low-resource languages. However, some low-resource languages have up to tens of millions of speakers globally, making it important to improve NLG tools for them. Table-to-Text NLG is an excellent measure of models' reasoning abilities but is very challenging in the multilingual setting. System outputs are often not attributable, or faithful, to the data in the source table. Intermediate planning techniques like Question-Answer (QA) blueprints have been shown to improve attributability on summarisation tasks. This work explores whether QA blueprints make multilingual Table-to-Text outputs more attributable to the input tables. This paper extends the challenging multilingual Table-to-Text dataset, TaTA, which includes African languages, with QA blueprints. Sequence-to-sequence language models are then finetuned on this dataset, with and without blueprints. Results show that QA blueprints improve performance for models finetuned and evaluated only on English examples, but do not demonstrate gains in the multilingual setting. This is due to inaccuracies in machine translating the blueprints from English into target languages when generating the training data, and models failing to rely closely on the blueprints they generate. An in-depth analysis is conducted on why this is challenging.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Knowledge Graph Completion with Entity Neighborhood and Relation Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) aims to infer missing information in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to address their inherent incompleteness. Traditional structure-based KGC methods, while effective, face significant computational demands and scalability challenges due to the need for dense embedding learning and scoring all entities in the KG for each prediction. Recent text-based approaches using language models like T5 and BERT have mitigated these issues by converting KG triples into text for reasoning. However, they often fail to fully utilize contextual information, focusing mainly on the neighborhood of the entity and neglecting the context of the relation. To address this issue, we propose KGC-ERC, a framework that integrates both types of context to enrich the input of generative language models and enhance their reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we introduce a sampling strategy to effectively select relevant context within input token constraints, which optimizes the utilization of contextual information and potentially improves model performance. Experiments on the Wikidata5M, Wiki27K, and FB15K-237-N datasets show that KGC-ERC outperforms or matches state-of-the-art baselines in predictive performance and scalability.</description>

      <title>RECALL-MM: A Multimodal Dataset of Consumer Product Recalls for Risk Analysis using Computational Methods and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Product recalls provide valuable insights into potential risks and hazards within the engineering design process, yet their full potential remains underutilized. In this study, we curate data from the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recalls database to develop a multimodal dataset, RECALL-MM, that informs data-driven risk assessment using historical information, and augment it using generative methods. Patterns in the dataset highlight specific areas where improved safety measures could have significant impact. We extend our analysis by demonstrating interactive clustering maps that embed all recalls into a shared latent space based on recall descriptions and product names. Leveraging these data-driven tools, we explore three case studies to demonstrate the dataset's utility in identifying product risks and guiding safer design decisions. The first two case studies illustrate how designers can visualize patterns across recalled products and situate new product ideas within the broader recall landscape to proactively anticipate hazards. In the third case study, we extend our approach by employing a large language model (LLM) to predict potential hazards based solely on product images. This demonstrates the model's ability to leverage visual context to identify risk factors, revealing strong alignment with historical recall data across many hazard categories. However, the analysis also highlights areas where hazard prediction remains challenging, underscoring the importance of risk awareness throughout the design process. Collectively, this work aims to bridge the gap between historical recall data and future product safety, presenting a scalable, data-driven approach to safer engineering design.</description>

      <title>Beyond speculation: Measuring the growing presence of LLM-generated texts in multilingual disinformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increased sophistication of large language models (LLMs) and the consequent quality of generated multilingual text raises concerns about potential disinformation misuse. While humans struggle to distinguish LLM-generated content from human-written texts, the scholarly debate about their impact remains divided. Some argue that heightened fears are overblown due to natural ecosystem limitations, while others contend that specific "longtail" contexts face overlooked risks. Our study bridges this debate by providing the first empirical evidence of LLM presence in the latest real-world disinformation datasets, documenting the increase of machine-generated content following ChatGPT's release, and revealing crucial patterns across languages, platforms, and time periods.</description>

      <title>Evaluating how LLM annotations represent diverse views on contentious topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers have proposed the use of generative large language models (LLMs) to label data for both research and applied settings. This literature emphasizes the improved performance of LLMs relative to other natural language models, noting that LLMs typically outperform other models on standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. However, previous literature has also highlighted the bias embedded in language models, particularly around contentious topics such as potentially toxic content. This bias could result in labels applied by LLMs that disproportionately align with majority groups over a more diverse set of viewpoints. In this paper, we evaluate how LLMs represent diverse viewpoints on these contentious tasks. Across four annotation tasks on four datasets, we show that LLMs do not show substantial disagreement with annotators on the basis of demographics. Instead, the model, prompt, and disagreement between human annotators on the labeling task are far more predictive of LLM agreement. Our findings suggest that when using LLMs to annotate data, under-representing the views of particular groups is not a substantial concern. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for researchers and practitioners.</description>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) tackle increasingly complex tasks and longer documents, their computational and memory costs during inference become a major bottleneck. To address this, we propose PromptDistill, a novel, training-free method that improves inference efficiency while preserving generation quality. PromptDistill identifies and retains the most informative tokens by leveraging attention interactions in early layers, preserving their hidden states while reducing the computational burden in later layers. This allows the model to focus on essential contextual information without fully processing all tokens. Unlike previous methods such as H2O and SnapKV, which perform compression only after processing the entire input, or GemFilter, which selects a fixed portion of the initial prompt without considering contextual dependencies, PromptDistill dynamically allocates computational resources to the most relevant tokens while maintaining a global awareness of the input. Experiments using our method and baseline approaches with base models such as LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, Phi 3.5 Mini Instruct, and Qwen2 7B Instruct on benchmarks including LongBench, InfBench, and Needle in a Haystack demonstrate that PromptDistill significantly improves efficiency while having minimal impact on output quality compared to the original models. With a single-stage selection strategy, PromptDistill effectively balances performance and efficiency, outperforming prior methods like GemFilter, H2O, and SnapKV due to its superior ability to retain essential information. Specifically, compared to GemFilter, PromptDistill achieves an overall $1\%$ to $5\%$ performance improvement while also offering better time efficiency. Additionally, we explore multi-stage selection, which further improves efficiency while maintaining strong generation performance.</description>

      <title>Extracting Patient History from Clinical Text: A Comparative Study of Clinical Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting medical history entities (MHEs) related to a patient's chief complaint (CC), history of present illness (HPI), and past, family, and social history (PFSH) helps structure free-text clinical notes into standardized EHRs, streamlining downstream tasks like continuity of care, medical coding, and quality metrics. Fine-tuned clinical large language models (cLLMs) can assist in this process while ensuring the protection of sensitive data via on-premises deployment. This study evaluates the performance of cLLMs in recognizing CC/HPI/PFSH-related MHEs and examines how note characteristics impact model accuracy. We annotated 1,449 MHEs across 61 outpatient-related clinical notes from the MTSamples repository. To recognize these entities, we fine-tuned seven state-of-the-art cLLMs. Additionally, we assessed the models' performance when enhanced by integrating, problems, tests, treatments, and other basic medical entities (BMEs). We compared the performance of these models against GPT-4o in a zero-shot setting. To further understand the textual characteristics affecting model accuracy, we conducted an error analysis focused on note length, entity length, and segmentation. The cLLMs showed potential in reducing the time required for extracting MHEs by over 20%. However, detecting many types of MHEs remained challenging due to their polysemous nature and the frequent involvement of non-medical vocabulary. Fine-tuned GatorTron and GatorTronS, two of the most extensively trained cLLMs, demonstrated the highest performance. Integrating pre-identified BME information improved model performance for certain entities. Regarding the impact of textual characteristics on model performance, we found that longer entities were harder to identify, note length did not correlate with a higher error rate, and well-organized segments with headings are beneficial for the extraction.</description>

      <title>Cocktail: Chunk-Adaptive Mixed-Precision Quantization for Long-Context LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been able to handle longer and longer contexts. However, a context that is too long may cause intolerant inference latency and GPU memory usage. Existing methods propose mixed-precision quantization to the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs based on token granularity, which is time-consuming in the search process and hardware inefficient during computation. This paper introduces a novel approach called Cocktail, which employs chunk-adaptive mixed-precision quantization to optimize the KV cache. Cocktail consists of two modules: chunk-level quantization search and chunk-level KV cache computation. Chunk-level quantization search determines the optimal bitwidth configuration of the KV cache chunks quickly based on the similarity scores between the corresponding context chunks and the query, maintaining the model accuracy. Furthermore, chunk-level KV cache computation reorders the KV cache chunks before quantization, avoiding the hardware inefficiency caused by mixed-precision quantization in inference computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Cocktail outperforms state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods on various models and datasets.</description>

      <title>Advancing Sentiment Analysis in Tamil-English Code-Mixed Texts: Challenges and Transformer-Based Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sentiment analysis task in Tamil-English code-mixed texts has been explored using advanced transformer-based models. Challenges from grammatical inconsistencies, orthographic variations, and phonetic ambiguities have been addressed. The limitations of existing datasets and annotation gaps have been examined, emphasizing the need for larger and more diverse corpora. Transformer architectures, including XLM-RoBERTa, mT5, IndicBERT, and RemBERT, have been evaluated in low-resource, code-mixed environments. Performance metrics have been analyzed, highlighting the effectiveness of specific models in handling multilingual sentiment classification. The findings suggest that further advancements in data augmentation, phonetic normalization, and hybrid modeling approaches are required to enhance accuracy. Future research directions for improving sentiment analysis in code-mixed texts have been proposed.</description>

      <title>Using Source-Side Confidence Estimation for Reliable Translation into Unfamiliar Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an interactive machine translation (MT) system designed for users who are not proficient in the target language. It aims to improve trustworthiness and explainability by identifying potentially mistranslated words and allowing the user to intervene to correct mistranslations. However, confidence estimation in machine translation has traditionally focused on the target side. Whereas the conventional approach to source-side confidence estimation would have been to project target word probabilities to the source side via word alignments, we propose a direct, alignment-free approach that measures how sensitive the target word probabilities are to changes in the source embeddings. Experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional alignment-based methods at detection of mistranslations.</description>

      <title>Focus Directions Make Your Language Models Pay More Attention to Relevant Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) are prone to be distracted by irrelevant contexts. The reason for distraction remains poorly understood. In this paper, we first identify the contextual heads, a special group of attention heads that control the overall attention of the LLM. Then, we demonstrate that distraction arises when contextual heads fail to allocate sufficient attention to relevant contexts and can be mitigated by increasing attention to these contexts. We further identify focus directions, located at the key and query activations of these heads, which enable them to allocate more attention to relevant contexts without explicitly specifying which context is relevant. We comprehensively evaluate the effect of focus direction on various long-context tasks and find out focus directions could help to mitigate the poor task alignment of the long-context LLMs. We believe our findings could promote further research on long-context LLM alignment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce the concepts of linguistic transformation, linguistic loop and semantic deficit. By exploiting Lie group theoretical and geometric techniques, we define invariants that capture the structural properties of a whole linguistic loop. This result introduces new line of research, employing tools from Lie theory and higher-dimensional geometry within language studies. But, even more intriguingly, our study hints to a mathematical characterization of the meta-linguistic or pre-verbal thought, namely of those cognitive structures that precede the language.</description>

      <title>Not All LoRA Parameters Are Essential: Insights on Inference Necessity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current research on LoRA primarily focuses on minimizing the number of fine-tuned parameters or optimizing its architecture. However, the necessity of all fine-tuned LoRA layers during inference remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the contribution of each LoRA layer to the model's ability to predict the ground truth and hypothesize that lower-layer LoRA modules play a more critical role in model reasoning and understanding. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned with LoRA. Specifically, we identify a ``boundary layer'' that distinguishes essential LoRA layers by analyzing a small set of validation samples. During inference, we drop all LoRA layers beyond this boundary. We evaluate our approach on three strong baselines across four widely-used text generation datasets. Our results demonstrate consistent and significant improvements, underscoring the effectiveness of selectively retaining critical LoRA layers during inference.</description>

      <title>Discovering Knowledge Deficiencies of Language Models on Massive Knowledge Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess impressive linguistic capabilities but often fail to faithfully retain factual knowledge, leading to hallucinations and unreliable outputs. Understanding LLMs' knowledge deficiencies by exhaustively evaluating against full-scale knowledge bases is computationally prohibitive, especially for closed-weight models. We propose stochastic error ascent (SEA), a scalable and efficient framework for discovering knowledge deficiencies (errors) in closed-weight LLMs under a strict query budget. Rather than naively probing all knowledge candidates, SEA formulates error discovery as a stochastic optimization process: it iteratively retrieves new high-error candidates by leveraging the semantic similarity to previously observed failures. To further enhance search efficiency and coverage, SEA employs hierarchical retrieval across document and paragraph levels, and constructs a relation directed acyclic graph to model error propagation and identify systematic failure modes. Empirically, SEA uncovers 40.7x more knowledge errors than Automated Capability Discovery and 26.7% more than AutoBencher, while reducing the cost-per-error by 599x and 9x, respectively. Human evaluation confirms the high quality of generated questions, while ablation and convergence analyses validate the contribution of each component in SEA. Further analysis on the discovered errors reveals correlated failure patterns across LLM families and recurring deficits, highlighting the need for better data coverage and targeted fine-tuning in future LLM development.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Routers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a milestone in aligning large language models with human instructions and adapting them to downstream tasks. In particular, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained widespread attention due to its parameter efficiency. However, its impact on improving the performance of large models remains limited. Recent studies suggest that combining LoRA with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can significantly enhance fine-tuning performance. MoE adapts to the diversity and complexity of datasets by dynamically selecting the most suitable experts, thereby improving task accuracy and efficiency. Despite impressive results, recent studies reveal issues in the MoE routing mechanism, such as incorrect assignments and imbalanced expert allocation. Inspired by the principles of Redundancy and Fault Tolerance Theory. We innovatively integrate the concept of Mixture of Experts into the routing mechanism and propose an efficient fine-tuning method called Mixture of Routers (MoR). It employs multiple sub-routers for joint selection and uses a learnable main router to determine the weights of the sub-routers. The results show that MoR outperforms baseline models on most tasks, achieving an average performance improvement of 1%. MoR can serve as a plug-and-play, parameter-efficient fine-tuning method suitable for a wide range of applications. Our code is available here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoR-DFC6.</description>

      <title>FeRG-LLM : Feature Engineering by Reason Generation Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key tasks in machine learning for tabular data is feature engineering. Although it is vital for improving the performance of models, it demands considerable human expertise and deep domain knowledge, making it labor-intensive endeavor. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, \textbf{FeRG-LLM} (\textbf{Fe}ature engineering by \textbf{R}eason \textbf{G}eneration \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odels), a large language model designed to automatically perform feature engineering at an 8-billion-parameter scale. We have constructed two-stage conversational dialogues that enable language models to analyze machine learning tasks and discovering new features, exhibiting their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capabilities. We use these dialogues to fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B model and integrate Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to receive feedback improving quality of new features and the model's performance. Our experiments show that FeRG-LLM performs comparably to or better than Llama 3.1 70B on most datasets, while using fewer resources and achieving reduced inference time. It outperforms other studies in classification tasks and performs well in regression tasks. Moreover, since it does not rely on cloud-hosted LLMs like GPT-4 with extra API costs when generating features, it can be deployed locally, addressing security concerns.</description>

Abstract: We introduce ToRL (Tool-Integrated Reinforcement Learning), a framework for training large language models (LLMs) to autonomously use computational tools via reinforcement learning. Unlike supervised fine-tuning, ToRL allows models to explore and discover optimal strategies for tool use. Experiments with Qwen2.5-Math models show significant improvements: ToRL-7B reaches 43.3\% accuracy on AIME~24, surpassing reinforcement learning without tool integration by 14\% and the best existing Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) model by 17\%. Further analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as strategic tool invocation, self-regulation of ineffective code, and dynamic adaptation between computational and analytical reasoning, all arising purely through reward-driven learning.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Decoding Methods for LLM-based Agents for Faithful Multi-Hop Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently produce factually inaccurate outputs - a phenomenon known as hallucination - which limits their accuracy in knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation and agentic frameworks such as Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) can address this issue by giving the model access to external knowledge. However, LLMs often fail to remain faithful to retrieved information. Mitigating this is critical, especially if LLMs are required to reason about the retrieved information. Recent research has explored training-free decoding strategies to improve the faithfulness of model generations. We present a systematic analysis of how the combination of the ReAct framework and decoding strategies (i.e., DeCoRe, DoLa, and CAD) can influence the faithfulness of LLM-generated answers. Our results show that combining an agentic framework for knowledge retrieval with decoding methods that enhance faithfulness can increase accuracy on the downstream Multi-Hop Question Answering tasks. For example, we observe an F1 increase from 19.5 to 32.6 on HotpotQA when using ReAct and DoLa.</description>

      <title>CoRanking: Collaborative Ranking with Small and Large Ranking Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior listwise ranking performance. However, their superior performance often relies on large-scale parameters (\eg, GPT-4) and a repetitive sliding window process, which introduces significant efficiency challenges. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CoRanking}, a novel collaborative ranking framework that combines small and large ranking models for efficient and effective ranking. CoRanking first employs a small-size reranker to pre-rank all the candidate passages, bringing relevant ones to the top part of the list (\eg, top-20). Then, the LLM listwise reranker is applied to only rerank these top-ranked passages instead of the whole list, substantially enhancing overall ranking efficiency. Although more efficient, previous studies have revealed that the LLM listwise reranker have significant positional biases on the order of input passages. Directly feed the top-ranked passages from small reranker may result in the sub-optimal performance of LLM listwise reranker. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a passage order adjuster trained via reinforcement learning, which reorders the top passages from the small reranker to align with the LLM's preferences of passage order. Extensive experiments on three IR benchmarks demonstrate that CoRanking significantly improves efficiency (reducing ranking latency by about 70\%) while achieving even better effectiveness compared to using only the LLM listwise reranker.</description>

      <title>Speculative End-Turn Detector for Efficient Speech Chatbot Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems powered by large language models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding human speech and generating appropriate spoken responses. However, these systems struggle with end-turn detection (ETD) -- the ability to distinguish between user turn completion and hesitation. This limitation often leads to premature or delayed responses, disrupting the flow of spoken conversations. In this paper, we introduce the ETD Dataset, the first public dataset for end-turn detection. The ETD dataset consists of both synthetic speech data generated with text-to-speech models and real-world speech data collected from web sources. We also propose SpeculativeETD, a novel collaborative inference framework that balances efficiency and accuracy to improve real-time ETD in resource-constrained environments. Our approach jointly employs a lightweight GRU-based model, which rapidly detects the non-speaking units in real-time on local devices, and a high-performance Wav2vec-based model running on the server to make a more challenging classification of distinguishing turn ends from mere pauses. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed SpeculativeETD significantly improves ETD accuracy while keeping the required computations low. Datasets and code will be available after the review.</description>

      <title>Order Independence With Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on many NLP tasks, yet often exhibit order dependence: simply reordering semantically identical tokens (e.g., answer choices in multiple-choice questions) can lead to inconsistent predictions. Recent work proposes Set-Based Prompting (SBP) as a way to remove order information from designated token subsets, thereby mitigating positional biases. However, applying SBP on base models induces an out-of-distribution input format, which can degrade in-distribution performance. We introduce a fine-tuning strategy that integrates SBP into the training process, "pulling" these set-formatted prompts closer to the model's training manifold. We show that SBP can be incorporated into a model via fine-tuning. Our experiments on in-distribution (MMLU) and out-of-distribution (CSQA, ARC Challenge) multiple-choice tasks show that SBP fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy and robustness to answer-order permutations, all while preserving broader language modeling capabilities. We discuss the broader implications of order-invariant modeling and outline future directions for building fairer, more consistent LLMs.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Prompt Optimization Discovers Emergent Multimodal Reasoning Strategies in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for optimizing prompts in vision-language models to elicit multimodal reasoning without model retraining. Using an evolutionary algorithm to guide prompt updates downstream of visual tasks, our approach improves upon baseline prompt-updating algorithms, which lack evolution-style "survival of the fittest" iteration. Crucially, we find this approach enables the language model to independently discover progressive problem-solving techniques across several evolution generations. For example, the model reasons that to "break down" visually complex spatial tasks, making a tool call to a Python interpreter to perform tasks (such as cropping, image segmentation, or saturation changes) would improve performance significantly. Our experimentation shows that explicitly evoking this "tool calling" call, via system-level XML $...\texttt{&lt;tool&gt;} ... \texttt{&lt;/tool&gt;}...$ tags, can effectively flag Python interpreter access for the same language model to generate relevant programs, generating advanced multimodal functionality. This functionality can be crystallized into a system-level prompt that induces improved performance at inference time, and our experimentation suggests up to $\approx 50\%$ relative improvement across select visual tasks. Downstream performance is trained and evaluated across subtasks from MathVista, M3CoT, and GeoBench-VLM datasets. Importantly, our approach shows that evolutionary prompt optimization guides language models towards self-reasoning discoveries, which result in improved zero-shot generalization across tasks.</description>

      <title>SCORE: Story Coherence and Retrieval Enhancement for AI Narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating creative narratives but struggle with long-term coherence and emotional consistency in complex stories. To address this, we propose SCORE (Story Coherence and Retrieval Enhancement), a framework integrating three components: 1) Dynamic State Tracking (monitoring objects/characters via symbolic logic), 2) Context-Aware Summarization (hierarchical episode summaries for temporal progression), and 3) Hybrid Retrieval (combining TF-IDF keyword relevance with cosine similarity-based semantic embeddings). The system employs a temporally-aligned Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to validate contextual consistency. Evaluations show SCORE achieves 23.6% higher coherence (NCI-2.0 benchmark), 89.7% emotional consistency (EASM metric), and 41.8% fewer hallucinations versus baseline GPT models. Its modular design supports incremental knowledge graph construction for persistent story memory and multi-LLM backend compatibility, offering an explainable solution for industrial-scale narrative systems requiring long-term consistency.</description>

      <title>RARE: Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain-specific intelligence demands specialized knowledge and sophisticated reasoning for problem-solving, posing significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) that struggle with knowledge hallucination and inadequate reasoning capabilities under constrained parameter budgets. Inspired by Bloom's Taxonomy in educational theory, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Modeling (RARE), a novel paradigm that decouples knowledge storage from reasoning optimization. RARE externalizes domain knowledge to retrievable sources and internalizes domain-specific reasoning patterns during training. Specifically, by injecting retrieved knowledge into training prompts, RARE transforms learning objectives from rote memorization to contextualized reasoning application. It enables models to bypass parameter-intensive memorization and prioritize the development of higher-order cognitive processes. Our experiments demonstrate that lightweight RARE-trained models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) could achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing retrieval-augmented GPT-4 and Deepseek-R1 distilled counterparts. RARE establishes a paradigm shift where maintainable external knowledge bases synergize with compact, reasoning-optimized models, collectively driving more scalable domain-specific intelligence.

      <title>If an LLM Were a Character, Would It Know Its Own Story? Evaluating Lifelong Learning in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can carry out human-like dialogue, but unlike humans, they are stateless due to the superposition property. However, during multi-turn, multi-agent interactions, LLMs begin to exhibit consistent, character-like behaviors, hinting at a form of emergent lifelong learning. Despite this, existing benchmarks often fail to capture these dynamics, primarily focusing on static, open-ended evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce LIFESTATE-BENCH, a benchmark designed to assess lifelong learning in LLMs. It features two episodic datasets: Hamlet and a synthetic script collection, rich in narrative structure and character interactions. Our fact checking evaluation probes models' self-awareness, episodic memory retrieval, and relationship tracking, across both parametric and non-parametric approaches. Experiments on models like Llama3.1-8B, GPT-4-turbo, and DeepSeek R1, we demonstrate that nonparametric methods significantly outperform parametric ones in managing stateful learning. However, all models exhibit challenges with catastrophic forgetting as interactions extend, highlighting the need for further advancements in lifelong learning.</description>

      <title>Question-Aware Knowledge Graph Prompting for Enhancing Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with tasks requiring external knowledge, such as knowledge-intensive Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA). Integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can enhance reasoning; however, existing methods typically demand costly fine-tuning or retrieve noisy KG information. Recent approaches leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate KG-based input embedding prefixes as soft prompts for LLMs but fail to account for question relevance, resulting in noisy prompts. Moreover, in MCQA tasks, the absence of relevant KG knowledge for certain answer options remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose Question-Aware Knowledge Graph Prompting (QAP), which incorporates question embeddings into GNN aggregation to dynamically assess KG relevance. QAP employs global attention to capture inter-option relationships, enriching soft prompts with inferred knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that QAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, highlighting its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Whisper-LM: Improving ASR Models with Language Models for Low-Resource Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition systems have undoubtedly advanced with the integration of multilingual and multitask models such as Whisper, which have shown a promising ability to understand and process speech across a wide range of languages. Despite their robustness, these models often fall short in handling the linguistic distinctions of minority languages. This study addresses this gap by integrating traditional and novel language models with fine-tuned Whisper models to raise their performance in less commonly studied languages. Through rigorous fine-tuning and evaluation across multiple datasets, we demonstrate substantial improvements in word error rate, particularly in low-resource scenarios. Our approach not only does take advantage of the extensive data Whisper was pre-trained on, but also complements its linguistic adaptability by incorporating language models. We obtained improvements up to 51\% for in-distribution datasets and up to 34\% for out-of-distribution sentences using statistical language models, while large language models provided moderate but consistently robust improvement across diverse linguistic contexts. The findings reveal that, while the integration reliably benefits all model sizes, the extent of improvement varies, highlighting the importance of optimized language model parameters. Finally, we emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate evaluation parameters when reporting the results using transformer-based ASR models. In summary, this research clears the way for more inclusive ASR technologies that perform better across languages by enriching their linguistic knowledge.

      <title>NRC VAD Lexicon v2: Norms for Valence, Arousal, and Dominance for over 55k English Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Factor analysis studies have shown that the primary dimensions of word meaning are Valence (V), Arousal (A), and Dominance (D) (also referred to in social cognition research as Competence (C)). These dimensions impact various aspects of our lives from social competence and emotion regulation to success in the work place and how we view the world. We present here the NRC VAD Lexicon v2, which has human ratings of valence, arousal, and dominance for more than 55,000 English words and phrases. Notably, it adds entries for $\sim$25k additional words to v1.0. It also now includes for the first time entries for common multi-word phrases (~10k). We show that the associations are highly reliable. The lexicon enables a wide variety of research in psychology, NLP, public health, digital humanities, and social sciences. The NRC VAD Lexicon v2 is made freely available for research through our project webpage.</description>

      <title>When LLM Therapists Become Salespeople: Evaluating Large Language Models for Ethical Motivational Interviewing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been actively applied in the mental health field. Recent research shows the promise of LLMs in applying psychotherapy, especially motivational interviewing (MI). However, there is a lack of studies investigating how language models understand MI ethics. Given the risks that malicious actors can use language models to apply MI for unethical purposes, it is important to evaluate their capability of differentiating ethical and unethical MI practices. Thus, this study investigates the ethical awareness of LLMs in MI with multiple experiments. Our findings show that LLMs have a moderate to strong level of knowledge in MI. However, their ethical standards are not aligned with the MI spirit, as they generated unethical responses and performed poorly in detecting unethical responses. We proposed a Chain-of-Ethic prompt to mitigate those risks and improve safety. Finally, our proposed strategy effectively improved ethical MI response generation and detection performance. These findings highlight the need for safety evaluations and guidelines for building ethical LLM-powered psychotherapy.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Code-switched Synthetic Data Quality is Task Dependent: Insights from MT and ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code-switching, the act of alternating between languages, emerged as a prevalent global phenomenon that needs to be addressed for building user-friendly language technologies. A main bottleneck in this pursuit is data scarcity, motivating research in the direction of code-switched data augmentation. However, current literature lacks comprehensive studies that enable us to understand the relation between the quality of synthetic data and improvements on NLP tasks. We extend previous research conducted in this direction on machine translation (MT) with results on automatic speech recognition (ASR) and cascaded speech translation (ST) to test generalizability of findings. Our experiments involve a wide range of augmentation techniques, covering lexical replacements, linguistic theories, and back-translation. Based on the results of MT, ASR, and ST, we draw conclusions and insights regarding the efficacy of various augmentation techniques and the impact of quality on performance.</description>

      <title>CrossFormer: Cross-Segment Semantic Fusion for Document Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text semantic segmentation involves partitioning a document into multiple paragraphs with continuous semantics based on the subject matter, contextual information, and document structure. Traditional approaches have typically relied on preprocessing documents into segments to address input length constraints, resulting in the loss of critical semantic information across segments. To address this, we present CrossFormer, a transformer-based model featuring a novel cross-segment fusion module that dynamically models latent semantic dependencies across document segments, substantially elevating segmentation accuracy. Additionally, CrossFormer can replace rule-based chunk methods within the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, producing more semantically coherent chunks that enhance its efficacy. Comprehensive evaluations confirm CrossFormer's state-of-the-art performance on public text semantic segmentation datasets, alongside considerable gains on RAG benchmarks.</description>

      <title>WHERE and WHICH: Iterative Debate for Biomedical Synthetic Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) tasks, such as Relation Extraction, Named Entity Recognition, and Text Classification, the scarcity of high-quality data remains a significant challenge. This limitation poisons large language models to correctly understand relationships between biological entities, such as molecules and diseases, or drug interactions, and further results in potential misinterpretation of biomedical documents. To address this issue, current approaches generally adopt the Synthetic Data Augmentation method which involves similarity computation followed by word replacement, but counterfactual data are usually generated. As a result, these methods disrupt meaningful word sets or produce sentences with meanings that deviate substantially from the original context, rendering them ineffective in improving model performance. To this end, this paper proposes a biomedical-dedicated rationale-based synthetic data augmentation method. Beyond the naive lexicon similarity, specific bio-relation similarity is measured to hold the augmented instance having a strong correlation with bio-relation instead of simply increasing the diversity of augmented data. Moreover, a multi-agents-involved reflection mechanism helps the model iteratively distinguish different usage of similar entities to escape falling into the mis-replace trap. We evaluate our method on the BLURB and BigBIO benchmark, which includes 9 common datasets spanning four major BioNLP tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate consistent performance improvements across all tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges associated with data scarcity and enhancing the overall performance of biomedical NLP models.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Pass the Turing Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluated 4 systems (ELIZA, GPT-4o, LLaMa-3.1-405B, and GPT-4.5) in two randomised, controlled, and pre-registered Turing tests on independent populations. Participants had 5 minute conversations simultaneously with another human participant and one of these systems before judging which conversational partner they thought was human. When prompted to adopt a humanlike persona, GPT-4.5 was judged to be the human 73% of the time: significantly more often than interrogators selected the real human participant. LLaMa-3.1, with the same prompt, was judged to be the human 56% of the time -- not significantly more or less often than the humans they were being compared to -- while baseline models (ELIZA and GPT-4o) achieved win rates significantly below chance (23% and 21% respectively). The results constitute the first empirical evidence that any artificial system passes a standard three-party Turing test. The results have implications for debates about what kind of intelligence is exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs), and the social and economic impacts these systems are likely to have.</description>

      <title>MKA: Leveraging Cross-Lingual Consensus for Model Abstention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliability of LLMs is questionable even as they get better at more tasks. A wider adoption of LLMs is contingent on whether they are usably factual. And if they are not, on whether they can properly calibrate their confidence in their responses. This work focuses on utilizing the multilingual knowledge of an LLM to inform its decision to abstain or answer when prompted. We develop a multilingual pipeline to calibrate the model's confidence and let it abstain when uncertain. We run several multilingual models through the pipeline to profile them across different languages. We find that the performance of the pipeline varies by model and language, but that in general they benefit from it. This is evidenced by the accuracy improvement of $71.2\%$ for Bengali over a baseline performance without the pipeline. Even a high-resource language like English sees a $15.5\%$ improvement. These results hint at possible further improvements.</description>

      <title>Mapping Geopolitical Bias in 11 Large Language Models: A Bilingual, Dual-Framing Analysis of U.S.-China Tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study systematically analyzes geopolitical bias across 11 prominent Large Language Models (LLMs) by examining their responses to seven critical topics in U.S.-China relations. Utilizing a bilingual (English and Chinese) and dual-framing (affirmative and reverse) methodology, we generated 19,712 prompts designed to detect ideological leanings in model outputs. Responses were quantitatively assessed on a normalized scale from -2 (strongly Pro-China) to +2 (strongly Pro-U.S.) and categorized according to stance, neutrality, and refusal rates. The findings demonstrate significant and consistent ideological alignments correlated with the LLMs' geographic origins; U.S.-based models predominantly favored Pro-U.S. stances, while Chinese-origin models exhibited pronounced Pro-China biases. Notably, language and prompt framing substantially influenced model responses, with several LLMs exhibiting stance reversals based on prompt polarity or linguistic context. Additionally, we introduced comprehensive metrics to evaluate response consistency across languages and framing conditions, identifying variability and vulnerabilities in model behaviors. These results offer practical insights that can guide organizations and individuals in selecting LLMs best aligned with their operational priorities and geopolitical considerations, underscoring the importance of careful model evaluation in politically sensitive applications. Furthermore, the research highlights specific prompt structures and linguistic variations that can strategically trigger distinct responses from models, revealing methods for effectively navigating and influencing LLM outputs.</description>

      <title>Building Instruction-Tuning Datasets from Human-Written Instructions with Open-Weight Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve real-world tasks. Prior work has shown the effectiveness of instruction-tuning data synthesized solely from LLMs, raising a fundamental question: Do we still need human-originated signals for instruction tuning? This work answers the question affirmatively: we build state-of-the-art instruction-tuning datasets sourced from human-written instructions, by simply pairing them with LLM-generated responses. LLMs fine-tuned on our datasets consistently outperform those fine-tuned on existing ones. Our data construction approach can be easily adapted to other languages; we build datasets for Japanese and confirm that LLMs tuned with our data reach state-of-the-art performance. Analyses suggest that instruction-tuning in a new language allows LLMs to follow instructions, while the tuned models exhibit a notable lack of culture-specific knowledge in that language. The datasets and fine-tuned models will be publicly available. Our datasets, synthesized with open-weight LLMs, are openly distributed under permissive licenses, allowing for diverse use cases.</description>

      <title>AdaMMS: Model Merging for Heterogeneous Multimodal Large Language Models with Unsupervised Coefficient Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, model merging methods have demonstrated powerful strengths in combining abilities on various tasks from multiple Large Language Models (LLMs). While previous model merging methods mainly focus on merging homogeneous models with identical architecture, they meet challenges when dealing with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with inherent heterogeneous property, including differences in model architecture and the asymmetry in the parameter space. In this work, we propose AdaMMS, a novel model merging method tailored for heterogeneous MLLMs. Our method tackles the challenges in three steps: mapping, merging and searching. Specifically, we first design mapping function between models to apply model merging on MLLMs with different architecture. Then we apply linear interpolation on model weights to actively adapt the asymmetry in the heterogeneous MLLMs. Finally in the hyper-parameter searching step, we propose an unsupervised hyper-parameter selection method for model merging. As the first model merging method capable of merging heterogeneous MLLMs without labeled data, extensive experiments on various model combinations demonstrated that AdaMMS outperforms previous model merging methods on various vision-language benchmarks.</description>

      <title>LANID: LLM-assisted New Intent Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-oriented Dialogue Systems (TODS) often face the challenge of encountering new intents. New Intent Discovery (NID) is a crucial task that aims to identify these novel intents while maintaining the capability to recognize existing ones. Previous efforts to adapt TODS to new intents have struggled with inadequate semantic representation or have depended on external knowledge, which is often not scalable or flexible. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities; however, their scale can be impractical for real-world applications that involve extensive queries. To address the limitations of existing NID methods by leveraging LLMs, we propose LANID, a framework that enhances the semantic representation of lightweight NID encoders with the guidance of LLMs. Specifically, LANID employs the $K$-nearest neighbors and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithms to sample selective utterance pairs from the training set. It then queries an LLM to ascertain the relationships between these pairs. The data produced from this process is utilized to design a contrastive fine-tuning task, which is then used to train a small encoder with a contrastive triplet loss. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method across three distinct NID datasets, surpassing strong baselines in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/floatSDSDS/LANID.</description>

      <title>Texture or Semantics? Vision-Language Models Get Lost in Font Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable visual and linguistic capabilities, achieving impressive performance in various tasks such as image recognition and object localization. However, their effectiveness in fine-grained tasks remains an open question. In everyday scenarios, individuals encountering design materials, such as magazines, typography tutorials, research papers, or branding content, may wish to identify aesthetically pleasing fonts used in the text. Given their multimodal capabilities and free accessibility, many VLMs are often considered potential tools for font recognition. This raises a fundamental question: Do VLMs truly possess the capability to recognize fonts? To investigate this, we introduce the Font Recognition Benchmark (FRB), a compact and well-structured dataset comprising 15 commonly used fonts. FRB includes two versions: (i) an easy version, where 10 sentences are rendered in different fonts, and (ii) a hard version, where each text sample consists of the names of the 15 fonts themselves, introducing a stroop effect that challenges model perception. Through extensive evaluation of various VLMs on font recognition tasks, we arrive at the following key findings: (i) Current VLMs exhibit limited font recognition capabilities, with many state-of-the-art models failing to achieve satisfactory performance. (ii) Few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting provide minimal benefits in improving font recognition accuracy across different VLMs. (iii) Attention analysis sheds light on the inherent limitations of VLMs in capturing semantic features.</description>

      <title>CONGRAD:Conflicting Gradient Filtering for Multilingual Preference Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Naive joint training of large language models (LLMs) for multilingual preference alignment can suffer from negative interference. This is a known issue in multilingual training, where conflicting objectives degrade overall performance. However, the impact of this phenomenon in the context of multilingual preference alignment remains largely underexplored. To address this issue, we propose CONGRAD, a scalable and effective filtering method that selects high-quality preference samples with minimal gradient conflicts across languages. Our method leverages gradient surgery to retain samples aligned with an aggregated multilingual update direction. Additionally, we incorporate a sublinear gradient compression strategy that reduces memory overhead during gradient accumulation. We integrate CONGRAD into self-rewarding framework and evaluate on LLaMA3-8B and Gemma2-2B across 10 languages. Results show that CONGRAD consistently outperforms strong baselines in both seen and unseen languages, with minimal alignment tax.</description>

      <title>WinoWhat: A Parallel Corpus of Paraphrased WinoGrande Sentences with Common Sense Categorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we take a closer look at how Winograd schema challenges can be used to evaluate common sense reasoning in LLMs. Specifically, we evaluate generative models of different sizes on the popular WinoGrande benchmark. We release WinoWhat, a new corpus, in which each instance of the WinoGrande validation set is paraphrased. Additionally, we evaluate the performance on the challenge across five common sense knowledge categories, giving more fine-grained insights on what types of knowledge are more challenging for LLMs. Surprisingly, all models perform significantly worse on WinoWhat, implying that LLM reasoning capabilities are overestimated on WinoGrande. To verify whether this is an effect of benchmark memorization, we match benchmark instances to LLM trainingdata and create two test-suites. We observe that memorization has a minimal effect on model performance on WinoGrande.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Layer-skipping in Pre-trained LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various layer-skipping methods have been proposed to accelerate token generation in large language models (LLMs). However, they have overlooked a fundamental question: How do computational demands vary across the generation of different tokens? In this work, we introduce FlexiDepth, a method that dynamically adjusts the number of Transformer layers used in text generation. By incorporating a plug-in router and adapter, FlexiDepth enables adaptive layer-skipping in LLMs without modifying their original parameters. Introducing FlexiDepth to Llama-3-8B model achieves layer skipping of 8 layers out of 32, and meanwhile maintains the full 100\% benchmark performance. Experimental results with FlexiDepth demonstrate that computational demands in LLMs significantly vary based on token type. Specifically, generating repetitive tokens or fixed phrases requires fewer layers, whereas producing tokens involving computation or high uncertainty requires more layers. Interestingly, this adaptive allocation pattern aligns with human intuition. To advance research in this area, we open sourced FlexiDepth and a dataset documenting FlexiDepth's layer allocation patterns for future exploration.</description>

      <title>Did ChatGPT or Copilot use alter the style of internet news headlines? A time series regression analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The release of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Copilot is changing the way text is created and may influence the content that we find on the web. This study investigated whether the release of these two popular LLMs coincided with a change in writing style in headlines and links on worldwide news websites. 175 NLP features were obtained for each text in a dataset of 451 million headlines/links. An interrupted time series analysis was applied for each of the 175 NLP features to evaluate whether there were any statistically significant sustained changes after the release dates of ChatGPT and/or Copilot. There were a total of 44 features that did not appear to have any significant sustained change after the release of ChatGPT/Copilot. A total of 91 other features did show significant change with ChatGPT and/or Copilot although significance with earlier control LLM release dates (GPT-1/2/3, Gopher) removed them from consideration. This initial analysis suggests these language models may have had a limited impact on the style of individual news headlines/links, with respect to only some NLP measures.</description>

      <title>Expanding RL with Verifiable Rewards Across Diverse Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown promising results in mathematical reasoning and coding tasks where well-structured reference answers are available. However, its applicability to broader domains remains underexplored. In this work, we study the extension of RLVR to more diverse domains such as medicine, chemistry, psychology, and economics. We observe high agreement in binary judgments across different large language models (LLMs) when objective reference answers exist, which challenges the necessity of large-scale annotation for training domain-specific reward models. To address the limitations of binary rewards when handling unstructured reference answers, we further incorporate model-based soft scoring into RLVR to improve its flexibility. Our experiments show that a distilled generative reward model can serve as an effective cross-domain verifier, providing reliable reward signals for RL without requiring domain-specific annotations. By fine-tuning a base 7B model using various RL algorithms against our reward model, we obtain policies that outperform state-of-the-art open-source aligned LLMs such as Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B by a large margin, across domains in free-form answer settings. This also strengthens RLVR's robustness and scalability, highlighting its potential for real-world applications with noisy or weak labels.</description>

      <title>SpeechDialogueFactory: Generating High-Quality Speech Dialogue Data to Accelerate Your Speech-LLM Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality speech dialogue datasets are crucial for Speech-LLM development, yet existing acquisition methods face significant limitations. Human recordings incur high costs and privacy concerns, while synthetic approaches often lack conversational authenticity. To address these challenges, we introduce \textsc{SpeechDialogueFactory}, a production-ready framework for generating natural speech dialogues efficiently. Our solution employs a comprehensive pipeline including metadata generation, dialogue scripting, paralinguistic-enriched utterance simulation, and natural speech synthesis with voice cloning. Additionally, the system provides an interactive UI for detailed sample inspection and a high-throughput batch synthesis mode. Evaluations show that dialogues generated by our system achieve a quality comparable to human recordings while significantly reducing production costs. We release our work as an open-source toolkit, alongside example datasets available in English and Chinese, empowering researchers and developers in Speech-LLM research and development.</description>

      <title>Better wit than wealth: Dynamic Parametric Retrieval Augmented Generation for Test-time Knowledge Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from external sources and incorporating them into the context. While it improves reliability by providing factual texts, it significantly increases inference costs as context length grows and introduces challenging issue of RAG hallucination, primarily caused by the lack of corresponding parametric knowledge in LLMs. An efficient solution is to enhance the knowledge of LLMs at test-time. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by embedding document into LLMs parameters to perform test-time knowledge enhancement, effectively reducing inference costs through offline training. However, its high training and storage costs, along with limited generalization ability, significantly restrict its practical adoption. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamic Parametric RAG (DyPRAG), a novel framework that leverages a lightweight parameter translator model to efficiently convert documents into parametric knowledge. DyPRAG not only reduces inference, training, and storage costs but also dynamically generates parametric knowledge, seamlessly enhancing the knowledge of LLMs and resolving knowledge conflicts in a plug-and-play manner at test-time. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capabilities of DyPRAG, offering a powerful and practical RAG paradigm which enables superior knowledge fusion and mitigates RAG hallucination in real-world applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/DyPRAG.</description>

      <title>Rubrik's Cube: Testing a New Rubric for Evaluating Explanations on the CUBE dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance and usability of Large-Language Models (LLMs) are driving their use in explanation generation tasks. However, despite their widespread adoption, LLM explanations have been found to be unreliable, making it difficult for users to distinguish good from bad explanations. To address this issue, we present Rubrik's CUBE, an education-inspired rubric and a dataset of 26k explanations, written and later quality-annotated using the rubric by both humans and six open- and closed-source LLMs. The CUBE dataset focuses on two reasoning and two language tasks, providing the necessary diversity for us to effectively test our proposed rubric. Using Rubrik, we find that explanations are influenced by both task and perceived difficulty. Low quality stems primarily from a lack of conciseness in LLM-generated explanations, rather than cohesion and word choice. The full dataset, rubric, and code will be made available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Based Adaptive Weighting for Self-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mathematical problem-solving capabilities of large language models have become a focal point of research, with growing interests in leveraging self-generated reasoning paths as a promising way to refine and enhance these models. These paths capture step-by-step logical processes while requiring only the correct answer for supervision. The self-training method has been shown to be effective in reasoning tasks while eliminating the need for external models and manual annotations. However, optimizing the use of self-generated data for model training remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose Entropy-Based Adaptive Weighting for Self-Training (EAST), an adaptive weighting strategy designed to prioritize uncertain data during self-training. Specifically, EAST employs a mapping function with a tunable parameter that controls the sharpness of the weighting, assigning higher weights to data where the model exhibits greater uncertainty. This approach guides the model to focus on more informative and challenging examples, thereby enhancing its reasoning ability. We evaluate our approach on GSM8K and MATH benchmarks. Empirical results show that, while the vanilla method yields virtually no improvement (0%) on MATH, EAST achieves around a 1% gain over backbone model. On GSM8K, EAST attains a further 1-2% performance boost compared to the vanilla method.</description>

      <title>Model Hemorrhage and the Robustness Limits of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance across natural language processing tasks, yet undergo significant performance degradation when modified for deployment through quantization, pruning, or decoding strategy adjustments. We define this phenomenon as model hemorrhage - performance decline caused by parameter alterations and architectural changes. Through systematic analysis of various LLM frameworks, we identify key vulnerability patterns: layer expansion frequently disrupts attention mechanisms, compression techniques induce information loss cascades, and decoding adjustments amplify prediction divergences. Our investigation reveals transformer architectures exhibit inherent robustness thresholds that determine hemorrhage severity across modification types. We propose three mitigation strategies: gradient-aware pruning preserves critical weight pathways, dynamic quantization scaling maintains activation integrity, and decoding calibration aligns generation trajectories with original model distributions. This work establishes foundational metrics for evaluating model stability during adaptation, providing practical guidelines for maintaining performance while enabling efficient LLM deployment. Our findings advance understanding of neural network resilience under architectural transformations, particularly for large-scale language models.</description>

      <title>BeMERC: Behavior-Aware MLLM-based Framework for Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC), the task of identifying the emotion label for each utterance in a conversation, is vital for developing empathetic machines. Current MLLM-based MERC studies focus mainly on capturing the speaker's textual or vocal characteristics, but ignore the significance of video-derived behavior information. Different from text and audio inputs, learning videos with rich facial expression, body language and posture, provides emotion trigger signals to the models for more accurate emotion predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel behavior-aware MLLM-based framework (BeMERC) to incorporate speaker's behaviors, including subtle facial micro-expression, body language and posture, into a vanilla MLLM-based MERC model, thereby facilitating the modeling of emotional dynamics during a conversation. Furthermore, BeMERC adopts a two-stage instruction tuning strategy to extend the model to the conversations scenario for end-to-end training of a MERC predictor. Experiments demonstrate that BeMERC achieves superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets, and also provides a detailed discussion on the significance of video-derived behavior information in MERC.</description>

      <title>Comparing representations of long clinical texts for the task of patient note-identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of patient-note identification, which involves accurately matching an anonymized clinical note to its corresponding patient, represented by a set of related notes. This task has broad applications, including duplicate records detection and patient similarity analysis, which require robust patient-level representations. We explore various embedding methods, including Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN), three-level Hierarchical Transformer Networks (HTN), LongFormer, and advanced BERT-based models, focusing on their ability to process mediumto-long clinical texts effectively. Additionally, we evaluate different pooling strategies (mean, max, and mean_max) for aggregating wordlevel embeddings into patient-level representations and we examine the impact of sliding windows on model performance. Our results indicate that BERT-based embeddings outperform traditional and hierarchical models, particularly in processing lengthy clinical notes and capturing nuanced patient representations. Among the pooling strategies, mean_max pooling consistently yields the best results, highlighting its ability to capture critical features from clinical notes. Furthermore, the reproduction of our results on both MIMIC dataset and Necker hospital data warehouse illustrates the generalizability of these approaches to real-world applications, emphasizing the importance of both embedding methods and aggregation strategies in optimizing patient-note identification and enhancing patient-level modeling.</description>

      <title>You Cannot Feed Two Birds with One Score: the Accuracy-Naturalness Tradeoff in Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of translation, be it by human or by machine, is, given some text in a source language, to produce text in a target language that simultaneously 1) preserves the meaning of the source text and 2) achieves natural expression in the target language. However, researchers in the machine translation community usually assess translations using a single score intended to capture semantic accuracy and the naturalness of the output simultaneously. In this paper, we build on recent advances in information theory to mathematically prove and empirically demonstrate that such single-score summaries do not and cannot give the complete picture of a system's true performance. Concretely, we prove that a tradeoff exists between accuracy and naturalness and demonstrate it by evaluating the submissions to the WMT24 shared task. Our findings help explain well-known empirical phenomena, such as the observation that optimizing translation systems for a specific accuracy metric (like BLEU) initially improves the system's naturalness, while ``overfitting'' the system to the metric can significantly degrade its naturalness. Thus, we advocate for a change in how translations are evaluated: rather than comparing systems using a single number, they should be compared on an accuracy-naturalness plane.</description>

      <title>Crossing Boundaries: Leveraging Semantic Divergences to Explore Cultural Novelty in Cooking Recipes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novelty modeling and detection is a core topic in Natural Language Processing (NLP), central to numerous tasks such as recommender systems and automatic summarization. It involves identifying pieces of text that deviate in some way from previously known information. However, novelty is also a crucial determinant of the unique perception of relevance and quality of an experience, as it rests upon each individual's understanding of the world. Social factors, particularly cultural background, profoundly influence perceptions of novelty and innovation. Cultural novelty arises from differences in salience and novelty as shaped by the distance between distinct communities. While cultural diversity has garnered increasing attention in artificial intelligence (AI), the lack of robust metrics for quantifying cultural novelty hinders a deeper understanding of these divergences. This gap limits quantifying and understanding cultural differences within computational frameworks. To address this, we propose an interdisciplinary framework that integrates knowledge from sociology and management. Central to our approach is GlobalFusion, a novel dataset comprising 500 dishes and approximately 100,000 cooking recipes capturing cultural adaptation from over 150 countries. By introducing a set of Jensen-Shannon Divergence metrics for novelty, we leverage this dataset to analyze textual divergences when recipes from one community are modified by another with a different cultural background. The results reveal significant correlations between our cultural novelty metrics and established cultural measures based on linguistic, religious, and geographical distances. Our findings highlight the potential of our framework to advance the understanding and measurement of cultural diversity in AI.</description>

      <title>Artificial Conversations, Real Results: Fostering Language Detection with Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collecting high-quality training data is essential for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). However, acquiring such data is often costly and time-consuming, especially for non-English languages such as Italian. Recently, researchers have begun to explore the use of LLMs to generate synthetic datasets as a viable alternative. This study proposes a pipeline for generating synthetic data and a comprehensive approach for investigating the factors that influence the validity of synthetic data generated by LLMs by examining how model performance is affected by metrics such as prompt strategy, text length and target position in a specific task, i.e. inclusive language detection in Italian job advertisements. Our results show that, in most cases and across different metrics, the fine-tuned models trained on synthetic data consistently outperformed other models on both real and synthetic test datasets. The study discusses the practical implications and limitations of using synthetic data for language detection tasks with LLMs.</description>

      <title>Is LLM the Silver Bullet to Low-Resource Languages Machine Translation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Resource Languages (LRLs) present significant challenges in natural language processing due to their limited linguistic resources and underrepresentation in standard datasets. While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Neural Machine Translation (NMT) have substantially improved translation capabilities for high-resource languages, performance disparities persist for LRLs, particularly impacting privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained scenarios. This paper systematically evaluates the limitations of current LLMs across 200 languages using benchmarks such as FLORES-200. We also explore alternative data sources, including news articles and bilingual dictionaries, and demonstrate how knowledge distillation from large pre-trained models can significantly improve smaller LRL translations. Additionally, we investigate various fine-tuning strategies, revealing that incremental enhancements markedly reduce performance gaps on smaller LLMs.</description>

      <title>TeleAntiFraud-28k: A Audio-Text Slow-Thinking Dataset for Telecom Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of telecom fraud faces significant challenges due to the lack of high-quality multimodal training data that integrates audio signals with reasoning-oriented textual analysis. To address this gap, we present TeleAntiFraud-28k, the first open-source audio-text slow-thinking dataset specifically designed for automated telecom fraud analysis. Our dataset is constructed through three strategies: (1) Privacy-preserved text-truth sample generation using automatically speech recognition (ASR)-transcribed call recordings (with anonymized original audio), ensuring real-world consistency through text-to-speech (TTS) model regeneration; (2) Semantic enhancement via large language model (LLM)-based self-instruction sampling on authentic ASR outputs to expand scenario coverage; (3) Multi-agent adversarial synthesis that simulates emerging fraud tactics through predefined communication scenarios and fraud typologies. The generated dataset contains 28,511 rigorously processed speech-text pairs, complete with detailed annotations for fraud reasoning. The dataset is divided into three tasks: scenario classification, fraud detection, fraud type classification. Furthermore, we construct TeleAntiFraud-Bench, a standardized evaluation benchmark comprising proportionally sampled instances from the dataset, to facilitate systematic testing of model performance on telecom fraud detection tasks. We also contribute a production-optimized supervised fine-tuning (SFT) model trained on hybrid real/synthetic data, while open-sourcing the data processing framework to enable community-driven dataset expansion. This work establishes a foundational framework for multimodal anti-fraud research while addressing critical challenges in data privacy and scenario diversity. The project will be released at https://github.com/JimmyMa99/TeleAntiFraud.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Learning for Extracting Menstrual Characteristics from Clinical Notes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Menstrual health is a critical yet often overlooked aspect of women's healthcare. Despite its clinical relevance, detailed data on menstrual characteristics is rarely available in structured medical records. To address this gap, we propose a novel Natural Language Processing pipeline to extract key menstrual cycle attributes -- dysmenorrhea, regularity, flow volume, and intermenstrual bleeding. Our approach utilizes the GatorTron model with Multi-Task Prompt-based Learning, enhanced by a hybrid retrieval preprocessing step to identify relevant text segments. It out- performs baseline methods, achieving an average F1-score of 90% across all menstrual characteristics, despite being trained on fewer than 100 annotated clinical notes. The retrieval step consistently improves performance across all approaches, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant segments of lengthy clinical notes. These results show that combining multi-task learning with retrieval improves generalization and performance across menstrual charac- teristics, advancing automated extraction from clinical notes and supporting women's health research.</description>

      <title>Implicit In-Context Learning: Evidence from Artificial Language Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans acquire language through implicit learning, absorbing complex patterns without explicit awareness. While LLMs demonstrate impressive linguistic capabilities, it remains unclear whether they exhibit human-like pattern recognition during in-context learning at inferencing level. We adapted three classic artificial language learning experiments spanning morphology, morphosyntax, and syntax to systematically evaluate implicit learning at inferencing level in two state-of-the-art OpenAI models: gpt-4o and o3-mini. Our results reveal linguistic domain-specific alignment between models and human behaviors, o3-mini aligns better in morphology while both models align in syntax.</description>

      <title>TwT: Thinking without Tokens by Habitual Reasoning Distillation with Multi-Teachers' Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in problem-solving by incorporating reasoning processes. However, this enhanced reasoning capability results in an increased number of output tokens during inference, leading to higher computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose TwT (Thinking without Tokens), a method that reduces inference-time costs through habitual reasoning distillation with multi-teachers' guidance, while maintaining high performance. Our approach introduces a Habitual Reasoning Distillation method, which internalizes explicit reasoning into the model's habitual behavior through a Teacher-Guided compression strategy inspired by human cognition. Additionally, we propose Dual-Criteria Rejection Sampling (DCRS), a technique that generates a high-quality and diverse distillation dataset using multiple teacher models, making our method suitable for unsupervised scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that TwT effectively reduces inference costs while preserving superior performance, achieving up to a 13.6% improvement in accuracy with fewer output tokens compared to other distillation methods, offering a highly practical solution for efficient LLM deployment.</description>

      <title>Synthetic News Generation for Fake News Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the generation and evaluation of synthetic fake news through fact based manipulations using large language models (LLMs). We introduce a novel methodology that extracts key facts from real articles, modifies them, and regenerates content to simulate fake news while maintaining coherence. To assess the quality of the generated content, we propose a set of evaluation metrics coherence, dissimilarity, and correctness. The research also investigates the application of synthetic data in fake news classification, comparing traditional machine learning models with transformer based models such as BERT. Our experiments demonstrate that transformer models, especially BERT, effectively leverage synthetic data for fake news detection, showing improvements with smaller proportions of synthetic data. Additionally, we find that fact verification features, which focus on identifying factual inconsistencies, provide the most promising results in distinguishing synthetic fake news. The study highlights the potential of synthetic data to enhance fake news detection systems, offering valuable insights for future research and suggesting that targeted improvements in synthetic data generation can further strengthen detection models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents BAR-Analytics, a web-based, open-source platform designed to analyze news dissemination across geographical, economic, political, and cultural boundaries. Using the Russian-Ukrainian and Israeli-Palestinian conflicts as case studies, the platform integrates four analytical methods: propagation analysis, trend analysis, sentiment analysis, and temporal topic modeling. Over 350,000 articles were collected and analyzed, with a focus on economic disparities and geographical influences using metadata enrichment. We evaluate the case studies using coherence, sentiment polarity, topic frequency, and trend shifts as key metrics. Our results show distinct patterns in news coverage: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict tends to have more negative sentiment with a focus on human rights, while the Russia-Ukraine conflict is more positive, emphasizing election interference. These findings highlight the influence of political, economic, and regional factors in shaping media narratives across different conflicts.</description>

      <title>What, How, Where, and How Well? A Survey on Test-Time Scaling in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As enthusiasm for scaling computation (data and parameters) in the pretraining era gradually diminished, test-time scaling (TTS), also referred to as ``test-time computing'' has emerged as a prominent research focus. Recent studies demonstrate that TTS can further elicit the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling significant breakthroughs not only in specialized reasoning tasks, such as mathematics and coding, but also in general tasks like open-ended Q&amp;A. However, despite the explosion of recent efforts in this area, there remains an urgent need for a comprehensive survey offering a systemic understanding. To fill this gap, we propose a unified, multidimensional framework structured along four core dimensions of TTS research: what to scale, how to scale, where to scale, and how well to scale. Building upon this taxonomy, we conduct an extensive review of methods, application scenarios, and assessment aspects, and present an organized decomposition that highlights the unique functional roles of individual techniques within the broader TTS landscape. From this analysis, we distill the major developmental trajectories of TTS to date and offer hands-on guidelines for practical deployment. Furthermore, we identify several open challenges and offer insights into promising future directions, including further scaling, clarifying the functional essence of techniques, generalizing to more tasks, and more attributions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for Telecommunications using Knowledge Graphs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in general-purpose natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs are still facing challenges when applied to domain-specific areas like telecommunications, which demands specialized expertise and adaptability to evolving standards. This paper presents a novel framework that combines knowledge graph (KG) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to enhance LLM performance in the telecom domain. The framework leverages a KG to capture structured, domain-specific information about network protocols, standards, and other telecom-related entities, comprehensively representing their relationships. By integrating KG with RAG, LLMs can dynamically access and utilize the most relevant and up-to-date knowledge during response generation. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between structured knowledge representation and the generative capabilities of LLMs, significantly enhancing accuracy, adaptability, and domain-specific comprehension. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the KG-RAG framework in addressing complex technical queries with precision. The proposed KG-RAG model attained an accuracy of 88% for question answering tasks on a frequently used telecom-specific dataset, compared to 82% for the RAG-only and 48% for the LLM-only approaches.</description>

      <title>Is analogy enough to draw novel adjective-noun inferences?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work (Ross et al., 2025, 2024) has argued that the ability of humans and LLMs respectively to generalize to novel adjective-noun combinations shows that they each have access to a compositional mechanism to determine the phrase's meaning and derive inferences. We study whether these inferences can instead be derived by analogy to known inferences, without need for composition. We investigate this by (1) building a model of analogical reasoning using similarity over lexical items, and (2) asking human participants to reason by analogy. While we find that this strategy works well for a large proportion of the dataset of Ross et al. (2025), there are novel combinations for which both humans and LLMs derive convergent inferences but which are not well handled by analogy. We thus conclude that the mechanism humans and LLMs use to generalize in these cases cannot be fully reduced to analogy, and likely involves composition.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Evaluation of LLM Strategies for Mental Health Text Analysis: Fine-tuning vs. Prompt Engineering vs. RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a systematic comparison of three approaches for the analysis of mental health text using large language models (LLMs): prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and fine-tuning. Using LLaMA 3, we evaluate these approaches on emotion classification and mental health condition detection tasks across two datasets. Fine-tuning achieves the highest accuracy (91% for emotion classification, 80% for mental health conditions) but requires substantial computational resources and large training sets, while prompt engineering and RAG offer more flexible deployment with moderate performance (40-68% accuracy). Our findings provide practical insights for implementing LLM-based solutions in mental health applications, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy, computational requirements, and deployment flexibility.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we introduce BEATS, a novel framework for evaluating Bias, Ethics, Fairness, and Factuality in Large Language Models (LLMs). Building upon the BEATS framework, we present a bias benchmark for LLMs that measure performance across 29 distinct metrics. These metrics span a broad range of characteristics, including demographic, cognitive, and social biases, as well as measures of ethical reasoning, group fairness, and factuality related misinformation risk. These metrics enable a quantitative assessment of the extent to which LLM generated responses may perpetuate societal prejudices that reinforce or expand systemic inequities. To achieve a high score on this benchmark a LLM must show very equitable behavior in their responses, making it a rigorous standard for responsible AI evaluation. Empirical results based on data from our experiment show that, 37.65\% of outputs generated by industry leading models contained some form of bias, highlighting a substantial risk of using these models in critical decision making systems. BEATS framework and benchmark offer a scalable and statistically rigorous methodology to benchmark LLMs, diagnose factors driving biases, and develop mitigation strategies. With the BEATS framework, our goal is to help the development of more socially responsible and ethically aligned AI models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for generating complex outputs that significantly improves accuracy in text-to-SQL tasks. Our method leverages execution results to select the most semantically consistent query from multiple candidates, enabling smaller, cost-effective models to surpass computationally intensive reasoning methods such as o1, o3-mini, and DeepSeek R1 while reducing inference cost by as much as 30 times. It integrates effortlessly with existing models, offering a practical and scalable pathway to state-of-the-art SQL generation.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the Reasoning Economy: A Survey of Efficient Reasoning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to perform complex reasoning tasks, transitioning from fast and intuitive thinking (System 1) to slow and deep reasoning (System 2). While System 2 reasoning improves task accuracy, it often incurs substantial computational costs due to its slow thinking nature and inefficient or unnecessary reasoning behaviors. In contrast, System 1 reasoning is computationally efficient but leads to suboptimal performance. Consequently, it is critical to balance the trade-off between performance (benefits) and computational costs (budgets), giving rise to the concept of reasoning economy. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of reasoning economy in both the post-training and test-time inference stages of LLMs, encompassing i) the cause of reasoning inefficiency, ii) behavior analysis of different reasoning patterns, and iii) potential solutions to achieve reasoning economy. By offering actionable insights and highlighting open challenges, we aim to shed light on strategies for improving the reasoning economy of LLMs, thereby serving as a valuable resource for advancing research in this evolving area. We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this fast-evolving field.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Aviation Communication Transcription: Fine-Tuning Distil-Whisper with LoRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transcription of aviation communications has several applications, from assisting air traffic controllers in identifying the accuracy of read-back errors to search and rescue operations. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have provided unprecedented opportunities for improving aviation communication transcription tasks. OpenAI's Whisper is one of the leading automatic speech recognition models. However, fine-tuning Whisper for aviation communication transcription is not computationally efficient. Thus, this paper aims to use a Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning method called Low-Rank Adaptation to fine-tune a more computationally efficient version of Whisper, distil-Whisper. To perform the fine-tuning, we used the Air Traffic Control Corpus dataset from the Linguistic Data Consortium, which contains approximately 70 hours of controller and pilot transmissions near three major airports in the US. The objective was to reduce the word error rate to enhance accuracy in the transcription of aviation communication. First, starting with an initial set of hyperparameters for LoRA (Alpha = 64 and Rank = 32), we performed a grid search. We applied a 5-fold cross-validation to find the best combination of distil-Whisper hyperparameters. Then, we fine-tuned the model for LoRA hyperparameters, achieving an impressive average word error rate of 3.86% across five folds. This result highlights the model's potential for use in the cockpit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have unlocked transformative possibilities in natural language processing, particularly within the financial sector. Financial data is often embedded in intricate relationships across textual content, numerical tables, and visual charts, posing challenges that traditional methods struggle to address effectively. However, the emergence of LLMs offers new pathways for processing and analyzing this multifaceted data with increased efficiency and insight. Despite the fast pace of innovation in LLM research, there remains a significant gap in their practical adoption within the finance industry, where cautious integration and long-term validation are prioritized. This disparity has led to a slower implementation of emerging LLM techniques, despite their immense potential in financial applications. As a result, many of the latest advancements in LLM technology remain underexplored or not fully utilized in this domain. This survey seeks to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of recent developments in LLM research and examining their applicability to the financial sector. Building on previous survey literature, we highlight several novel LLM methodologies, exploring their distinctive capabilities and their potential relevance to financial data analysis. By synthesizing insights from a broad range of studies, this paper aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners, offering direction on promising research avenues and outlining future opportunities for advancing LLM applications in finance.</description>

      <title>Enhancing nonnative speech perception and production through an AI-powered application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While research on using Artificial Intelligence (AI) through various applications to enhance foreign language pronunciation is expanding, it has primarily focused on aspects such as comprehensibility and intelligibility, largely neglecting the improvement of individual speech sounds in both perception and production. This study seeks to address this gap by examining the impact of training with an AI-powered mobile application on nonnative sound perception and production. Participants completed a pretest assessing their ability to discriminate the second language English heed-hid contrast and produce these vowels in sentence contexts. The intervention involved training with the Speakometer mobile application, which incorporated recording tasks featuring the English vowels, along with pronunciation feedback and practice. The posttest mirrored the pretest to measure changes in performance. The results revealed significant improvements in both discrimination accuracy and production of the target contrast following the intervention. However, participants did not achieve native-like competence. These findings highlight the effectiveness of AI-powered applications in facilitating speech acquisition and support their potential use for personalized, interactive pronunciation training beyond the classroom.</description>

      <title>CodeScientist: End-to-End Semi-Automated Scientific Discovery with Code-based Experimentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the surge of interest in autonomous scientific discovery (ASD) of software artifacts (e.g., improved ML algorithms), current ASD systems face two key limitations: (1) they largely explore variants of existing codebases or similarly constrained design spaces, and (2) they produce large volumes of research artifacts (such as automatically generated papers and code) that are typically evaluated using conference-style paper review with limited evaluation of code. In this work we introduce CodeScientist, a novel ASD system that frames ideation and experiment construction as a form of genetic search jointly over combinations of research articles and codeblocks defining common actions in a domain (like prompting a language model). We use this paradigm to conduct hundreds of automated experiments on machine-generated ideas broadly in the domain of agents and virtual environments, with the system returning 19 discoveries, 6 of which were judged as being both at least minimally sound and incrementally novel after a multi-faceted evaluation beyond that typically conducted in prior work, including external (conference-style) review, code review, and replication attempts. Moreover, the discoveries span new tasks, agents, metrics, and data, suggesting a qualitative shift from benchmark optimization to broader discoveries.</description>

      <title>InfoBid: A Simulation Framework for Studying Information Disclosure in Auctions with Large Language Model-based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In online advertising systems, publishers often face a trade-off in information disclosure strategies: while disclosing more information can enhance efficiency by enabling optimal allocation of ad impressions, it may lose revenue potential by decreasing uncertainty among competing advertisers. Similar to other challenges in market design, understanding this trade-off is constrained by limited access to real-world data, leading researchers and practitioners to turn to simulation frameworks. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers a novel approach to simulations, providing human-like reasoning and adaptability without necessarily relying on explicit assumptions about agent behavior modeling. Despite their potential, existing frameworks have yet to integrate LLM-based agents for studying information asymmetry and signaling strategies, particularly in the context of auctions. To address this gap, we introduce InfoBid, a flexible simulation framework that leverages LLM agents to examine the effects of information disclosure strategies in multi-agent auction settings. Using GPT-4o, we implemented simulations of second-price auctions with diverse information schemas. The results reveal key insights into how signaling influences strategic behavior and auction outcomes, which align with both economic and social learning theories. Through InfoBid, we hope to foster the use of LLMs as proxies for human economic and social agents in empirical studies, enhancing our understanding of their capabilities and limitations. This work bridges the gap between theoretical market designs and practical applications, advancing research in market simulations, information design, and agent-based reasoning while offering a valuable tool for exploring the dynamics of digital economies.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Beyond Limits: Advances and Open Problems for LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent generative reasoning breakthroughs have transformed how large language models (LLMs) tackle complex problems by dynamically retrieving and refining information while generating coherent, multi-step thought processes. Techniques such as inference-time scaling, reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and distillation have been successfully applied to models like DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI's o1 &amp; o3, GPT-4o, Qwen-32B, and various Llama variants, resulting in enhanced reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the top 27 LLM models released between 2023 and 2025 (including models such as Mistral AI Small 3 24B, DeepSeek-R1, Search-o1, QwQ-32B, and phi-4). Then, we present an extensive overview of training methodologies that spans general training approaches, mixture-of-experts (MoE) and architectural innovations, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), chain-of-thought and self-improvement techniques, as well as test-time compute scaling, distillation, and reinforcement learning (RL) methods. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in advancing LLM capabilities, including improving multi-step reasoning without human supervision, overcoming limitations in chained tasks, balancing structured prompts with flexibility, and enhancing long-context retrieval and external tool integration.</description>

      <title>Training in translation tools and technologies: Findings of the EMT survey 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article reports on the third iteration of a survey of computerized tools and technologies taught as part of postgraduate translation training programmes. While the survey was carried out under the aegis of the EMT Network, more than half of responses are from outside that network. The results show the responsiveness of programmes to innovations in translation technology, with increased compulsory inclusion of machine translation, post-editing, and quality evaluation, and a rapid response to the release of generative tools. The flexibility required during the Covid-19 pandemic has also led to some lasting changes to programmes. While the range of tools being taught has continued to expand, programmes seem to be consolidating their core offering around cloud-based software with cost-free academic access. There has also been an increase in the embedding of professional contexts and workflows associated with translation technology. Generic file management and data security skills have increased in perceived importance, and legal and ethical issues related to translation data have also become more prominent. In terms of course delivery the shift away from conventional labs identified in EMT2017 has accelerated markedly, no doubt partly driven by the pandemic, accompanied by a dramatic expansion in the use of students' personal devices.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Integrated Layered Attention (AILA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Adaptive Integrated Layered Attention (AILA), a neural network architecture that combines dense skip connections with different mechanisms for adaptive feature reuse across network layers. We evaluate AILA on three challenging tasks: price forecasting for various commodities and indices (S&amp;P 500, Gold, US dollar Futures, Coffee, Wheat), image recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset, and sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset. In all cases, AILA matches strong deep learning baselines (LSTMs, Transformers, and ResNets), achieving it at a fraction of the training and inference time. Notably, we implement and test two versions of the model - AILA-Architecture 1, which uses simple linear layers as the connection mechanism between layers, and AILA-Architecture 2, which implements an attention mechanism to selectively focus on outputs from previous layers. Both architectures are applied in a single-task learning setting, with each model trained separately for individual tasks. Results confirm that AILA's adaptive inter-layer connections yield robust gains by flexibly reusing pertinent features at multiple network depths. The AILA approach thus presents an extension to existing architectures, improving long-range sequence modeling, image recognition with optimised computational speed, and SOTA classification performance in practice.</description>

      <title>L0-Reasoning Bench: Evaluating Procedural Correctness in Language Models via Simple Program Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex reasoning tasks often rely on the ability to consistently and accurately apply simple rules across incremental steps, a foundational capability which we term "level-0" reasoning. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce L0-Bench, a language model benchmark for testing procedural correctness -- the ability to generate correct reasoning processes, complementing existing benchmarks that primarily focus on outcome correctness. Given synthetic Python functions with simple operations, L0-Bench grades models on their ability to generate step-by-step, error-free execution traces. The synthetic nature of L0-Bench enables systematic and scalable generation of test programs along various axes (e.g., number of trace steps). We evaluate a diverse array of recent closed-source and open-weight models on a baseline test set. All models exhibit degradation as the number of target trace steps increases, while larger models and reasoning-enhanced models better maintain correctness over multiple steps. Additionally, we use L0-Bench to explore test-time scaling along three dimensions: input context length, number of solutions for majority voting, and inference steps. Our results suggest substantial room to improve "level-0" reasoning and potential directions to build more reliable reasoning systems.</description>

      <title>Quamba2: A Robust and Scalable Post-training Quantization Framework for Selective State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) are emerging as a compelling alternative to Transformers because of their consistent memory usage and high performance. Despite this, scaling up SSMs on cloud services or limited-resource devices is challenging due to their storage requirements and computational power. To overcome this, quantizing SSMs with low bit-width data formats can reduce model size and benefit from hardware acceleration. As SSMs are prone to quantization-induced errors, recent efforts have focused on optimizing a particular model or bit-width for efficiency without sacrificing performance. However, distinct bit-width configurations are essential for different scenarios, like W4A8 for boosting large-batch decoding speed, and W4A16 for enhancing generation speed in short prompt applications for a single user. To this end, we present Quamba2, compatible with W8A8, W4A8, and W4A16 for both Mamba1 and Mamba2 backbones, addressing the growing demand for SSM deployment on various platforms. Based on the channel order preserving and activation persistence of SSMs, we propose an offline approach to quantize inputs of a linear recurrence in 8-bit by sorting and clustering for input $x$, combined with a per-state-group quantization for input-dependent parameters $B$ and $C$. To ensure compute-invariance in the SSM output, we rearrange weights offline according to the clustering sequence. The experiments show that Quamba2-8B outperforms several state-of-the-art SSM quantization methods and delivers 1.3$\times$ and 3$\times$ speed-ups in the pre-filling and generation stages, respectively, while offering 4$\times$ memory reduction with only a $1.6\%$ average accuracy drop. The evaluation on MMLU shows the generalizability and robustness of our framework. The code and quantized models will be released at: https://github.com/enyac-group/Quamba.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Korean large language models (LLMs) have spurred numerous benchmarks and evaluation methodologies, yet the lack of a standardized evaluation framework has led to inconsistent results and limited comparability. To address this, we introduce HRET Haerae Evaluation Toolkit, an open-source, self-evolving evaluation framework tailored specifically for Korean LLMs. HRET unifies diverse evaluation methods, including logit-based scoring, exact-match, language-inconsistency penalization, and LLM-as-a-Judge assessments. Its modular, registry-based architecture integrates major benchmarks (HAE-RAE Bench, KMMLU, KUDGE, HRM8K) and multiple inference backends (vLLM, HuggingFace, OpenAI-compatible endpoints). With automated pipelines for continuous evolution, HRET provides a robust foundation for reproducible, fair, and transparent Korean NLP research.</description>

      <title>FindTheFlaws: Annotated Errors for Detecting Flawed Reasoning and Scalable Oversight Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI models tackle increasingly complex problems, ensuring reliable human oversight becomes more challenging due to the difficulty of verifying solutions. Approaches to scaling AI supervision include debate, in which two agents engage in structured dialogue to help a judge evaluate claims; critique, in which models identify potential flaws in proposed solutions; and prover-verifier games, in which a capable 'prover' model generates solutions that must be verifiable by a less capable 'verifier'. Evaluations of the scalability of these and similar approaches to difficult problems benefit from datasets that include (1) long-form expert-verified correct solutions and (2) long-form flawed solutions with annotations highlighting specific errors, but few are available.
  To address this gap, we present FindTheFlaws, a group of five diverse datasets spanning medicine, mathematics, science, coding, and the Lojban language. Each dataset contains questions and long-form solutions with expert annotations validating their correctness or identifying specific error(s) in the reasoning. We evaluate frontier models' critiquing capabilities and observe a range of performance that can be leveraged for scalable oversight experiments: models performing more poorly on particular datasets can serve as judges/verifiers for more capable models. Additionally, for some task/dataset combinations, expert baselines exceed even top model performance, making them more beneficial for scalable oversight experiments.</description>

      <title>Agentic Large Language Models, a survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is great interest in agentic LLMs, large language models that act as agents. We review the growing body of work in this area and provide a research agenda. Agentic LLMs are LLMs that (1) reason, (2) act, and (3) interact. We organize the literature according to these three categories. The research in the first category focuses on reasoning, reflection, and retrieval, aiming to improve decision making; the second category focuses on action models, robots, and tools, aiming for agents that act as useful assistants; the third category focuses on multi-agent systems, aiming for collaborative task solving and simulating interaction to study emergent social behavior. We find that works mutually benefit from results in other categories: retrieval enables tool use, reflection improves multi-agent collaboration, and reasoning benefits all categories. We discuss applications of agentic LLMs and provide an agenda for further research. Important applications are in medical diagnosis, logistics and financial market analysis. Meanwhile, self-reflective agents playing roles and interacting with one another augment the process of scientific research itself. Further, agentic LLMs may provide a solution for the problem of LLMs running out of training data: inference-time behavior generates new training states, such that LLMs can keep learning without needing ever larger datasets. We note that there is risk associated with LLM assistants taking action in the real world, while agentic LLMs are also likely to benefit society.</description>

      <title>Efficient Adaptation For Remote Sensing Visual Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI), offering remarkable capabilities across multi-modal domains. Their ability to precisely locate objects in complex aerial and satellite images, using rich contextual information and detailed object descriptions, is essential for remote sensing (RS). These models can associate textual descriptions with object positions through the Visual Grounding (VG) task, but due to domain-specific challenges, their direct application to RS produces sub-optimal results. To address this, we applied Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) techniques to adapt these models for RS-specific VG tasks. Specifically, we evaluated LoRA placement across different modules in Grounding DINO and used BitFit and adapters to fine-tune the OFA foundation model pre-trained on general-purpose VG datasets. This approach achieved performance comparable to or surpassing current State Of The Art (SOTA) models while significantly reducing computational costs. This study highlights the potential of PEFT techniques to advance efficient and precise multi-modal analysis in RS, offering a practical and cost-effective alternative to full model training.</description>

      <title>Beyond Standard MoE: Mixture of Latent Experts for Resource-Efficient Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) has emerged as a pivotal architectural paradigm for efficient scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs), operating through selective activation of parameter subsets for each input token. Nevertheless, conventional MoE architectures encounter substantial challenges, including excessive memory utilization and communication overhead during training and inference, primarily attributable to the proliferation of expert modules. In this paper, we introduce Mixture of Latent Experts (MoLE), a novel parameterization methodology that facilitates the mapping of specific experts into a shared latent space. Specifically, all expert operations are systematically decomposed into two principal components: a shared projection into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by expert-specific transformations with significantly reduced parametric complexity. This factorized approach substantially diminishes parameter count and computational requirements. Beyond the pretraining implementation of the MoLE architecture, we also establish a rigorous mathematical framework for transforming pre-trained MoE models into the MoLE architecture, characterizing the sufficient conditions for optimal factorization and developing a systematic two-phase algorithm for this conversion process. Our comprehensive theoretical analysis demonstrates that MoLE significantly enhances computational efficiency across multiple dimensions while preserving model representational capacity. Empirical evaluations corroborate our theoretical findings, confirming that MoLE achieves performance comparable to standard MoE implementations while substantially reducing resource requirements.</description>

      <title>A large-scale image-text dataset benchmark for farmland segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traditional deep learning paradigm that solely relies on labeled data has limitations in representing the spatial relationships between farmland elements and the surrounding environment.It struggles to effectively model the dynamic temporal evolution and spatial heterogeneity of farmland. Language,as a structured knowledge carrier,can explicitly express the spatiotemporal characteristics of farmland, such as its shape, distribution,and surrounding environmental information.Therefore,a language-driven learning paradigm can effectively alleviate the challenges posed by the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of farmland.However,in the field of remote sensing imagery of farmland,there is currently no comprehensive benchmark dataset to support this research direction.To fill this gap,we introduced language based descriptions of farmland and developed FarmSeg-VL dataset,the first fine-grained image-text dataset designed for spatiotemporal farmland segmentation.Firstly, this article proposed a semi-automatic annotation method that can accurately assign caption to each image, ensuring high data quality and semantic richness while improving the efficiency of dataset construction.Secondly,the FarmSeg-VL exhibits significant spatiotemporal characteristics.In terms of the temporal dimension,it covers all four seasons.In terms of the spatial dimension,it covers eight typical agricultural regions across China.In addition, in terms of captions,FarmSeg-VL covers rich spatiotemporal characteristics of farmland,including its inherent properties,phenological characteristics, spatial distribution,topographic and geomorphic features,and the distribution of surrounding environments.Finally,we present a performance analysis of VLMs and the deep learning models that rely solely on labels trained on the FarmSeg-VL,demonstrating its potential as a standard benchmark for farmland segmentation.</description>

      <title>Can DeepSeek-V3 Reason Like a Surgeon? An Empirical Evaluation for Vision-Language Understanding in Robotic-Assisted Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DeepSeek-V3, a recently emerging Large Language Model (LLM), demonstrates outstanding performance in general scene understanding, question-answering (QA), and text generation tasks, owing to its efficient training paradigm and strong reasoning capabilities. In this study, we investigate the dialogue capabilities of DeepSeek-V3 in robotic surgery scenarios, focusing on tasks such as Single Phrase QA, Visual QA, and Detailed Description. The Single Phrase QA tasks further include sub-tasks such as surgical instrument recognition, action understanding, and spatial position analysis. We conduct extensive evaluations using publicly available datasets, including EndoVis18 and CholecT50, along with their corresponding dialogue data. Our comprehensive evaluation results indicate that, when provided with specific prompts, DeepSeek-V3 performs well in surgical instrument and tissue recognition tasks However, DeepSeek-V3 exhibits significant limitations in spatial position analysis and struggles to understand surgical actions accurately. Additionally, our findings reveal that, under general prompts, DeepSeek-V3 lacks the ability to effectively analyze global surgical concepts and fails to provide detailed insights into surgical scenarios. Based on our observations, we argue that the DeepSeek-V3 is not ready for vision-language tasks in surgical contexts without fine-tuning on surgery-specific datasets.</description>

      <title>When 'YES' Meets 'BUT': Can Large Models Comprehend Contradictory Humor Through Comparative Reasoning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding humor-particularly when it involves complex, contradictory narratives that require comparative reasoning-remains a significant challenge for large vision-language models (VLMs). This limitation hinders AI's ability to engage in human-like reasoning and cultural expression. In this paper, we investigate this challenge through an in-depth analysis of comics that juxtapose panels to create humor through contradictions. We introduce the YesBut (V2), a novel benchmark with 1,262 comic images from diverse multilingual and multicultural contexts, featuring comprehensive annotations that capture various aspects of narrative understanding. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate a wide range of VLMs through four complementary tasks spanning from surface content comprehension to deep narrative reasoning, with particular emphasis on comparative reasoning between contradictory elements. Our extensive experiments reveal that even the most advanced models significantly underperform compared to humans, with common failures in visual perception, key element identification, comparative analysis and hallucinations. We further investigate text-based training strategies and social knowledge augmentation methods to enhance model performance. Our findings not only highlight critical weaknesses in VLMs' understanding of cultural and creative expressions but also provide pathways toward developing context-aware models capable of deeper narrative understanding though comparative reasoning.</description>

      <title>CodeARC: Benchmarking Reasoning Capabilities of LLM Agents for Inductive Program Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inductive program synthesis, or programming by example, requires synthesizing functions from input-output examples that generalize to unseen inputs. While large language model agents have shown promise in programming tasks guided by natural language, their ability to perform inductive program synthesis is underexplored. Existing evaluation protocols rely on static sets of examples and held-out tests, offering no feedback when synthesized functions are incorrect and failing to reflect real-world scenarios such as reverse engineering. We propose CodeARC, the Code Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge, a new evaluation framework where agents interact with a hidden target function by querying it with new inputs, synthesizing candidate functions, and iteratively refining their solutions using a differential testing oracle. This interactive setting encourages agents to perform function calls and self-correction based on feedback. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for general-purpose inductive program synthesis, featuring 1114 functions. Among 18 models evaluated, o3-mini performs best with a success rate of 52.7%, highlighting the difficulty of this task. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on curated synthesis traces yields up to a 31% relative performance gain. CodeARC provides a more realistic and challenging testbed for evaluating LLM-based program synthesis and inductive reasoning.</description>

      <title>TRA: Better Length Generalisation with Threshold Relative Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers struggle with length generalisation, displaying poor performance even on basic tasks. We test whether these limitations can be explained through two key failures of the self-attention mechanism. The first is the inability to fully remove irrelevant information. The second is tied to position, even if the dot product between a key and query is highly negative (i.e. an irrelevant key) learned positional biases may unintentionally up-weight such information - dangerous when distances become out of distribution. Put together, these two failure cases lead to compounding generalisation difficulties. We test whether they can be mitigated through the combination of a) selective sparsity - completely removing irrelevant keys from the attention softmax and b) contextualised relative distance - distance is only considered as between the query and the keys that matter. We show how refactoring the attention mechanism with these two mitigations in place can substantially improve generalisation capabilities of decoder only transformers.</description>

      <title>Beyond Contrastive Learning: Synthetic Data Enables List-wise Training with Multiple Levels of Relevance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have allowed the augmentation of information retrieval (IR) pipelines with synthetic data in various ways. Yet, the main training paradigm remains: contrastive learning with binary relevance labels and the InfoNCE loss, where one positive document is compared against one or more negatives. This objective treats all documents that are not explicitly annotated as relevant on an equally negative footing, regardless of their actual degree of relevance, thus (a) missing subtle nuances that are useful for ranking and (b) being susceptible to annotation noise. To overcome this limitation, in this work we forgo real training documents and annotations altogether and use open-source LLMs to directly generate synthetic documents that answer real user queries according to several different levels of relevance. This fully synthetic ranking context of graduated relevance, together with an appropriate list-wise loss (Wasserstein distance), enables us to train dense retrievers in a way that better captures the ranking task. Experiments on various IR datasets show that our proposed approach outperforms conventional training with InfoNCE by a large margin. Without using any real documents for training, our dense retriever significantly outperforms the same retriever trained through self-supervision. More importantly, it matches the performance of the same retriever trained on real, labeled training documents of the same dataset, while being more robust to distribution shift and clearly outperforming it when evaluated zero-shot on the BEIR dataset collection.</description>

      <title>SPIO: Ensemble and Selective Strategies via LLM-Based Multi-Agent Planning in Automated Data Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized automated data analytics and machine learning by enabling dynamic reasoning and adaptability. While recent approaches have advanced multi-stage pipelines through multi-agent systems, they typically rely on rigid, single-path workflows that limit the exploration and integration of diverse strategies, often resulting in suboptimal predictions. To address these challenges, we propose SPIO (Sequential Plan Integration and Optimization), a novel framework that leverages LLM-driven decision-making to orchestrate multi-agent planning across four key modules: data preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and hyperparameter tuning. In each module, dedicated planning agents independently generate candidate strategies that cascade into subsequent stages, fostering comprehensive exploration. A plan optimization agent refines these strategies by suggesting several optimized plans. We further introduce two variants: SPIO-S, which selects a single best solution path as determined by the LLM, and SPIO-E, which selects the top k candidate plans and ensembles them to maximize predictive performance. Extensive experiments on Kaggle and OpenML datasets demonstrate that SPIO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing a robust and scalable solution for automated data science task.</description>

      <title>Beyond Unimodal Boundaries: Generative Recommendation with Multimodal Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) has become a powerful paradigm in recommendation systems that implicitly links modality and semantics to item representation, in contrast to previous methods that relied on non-semantic item identifiers in autoregressive models. However, previous research has predominantly treated modalities in isolation, typically assuming item content is unimodal (usually text). We argue that this is a significant limitation given the rich, multimodal nature of real-world data and the potential sensitivity of GR models to modality choices and usage. Our work aims to explore the critical problem of Multimodal Generative Recommendation (MGR), highlighting the importance of modality choices in GR nframeworks. We reveal that GR models are particularly sensitive to different modalities and examine the challenges in achieving effective GR when multiple modalities are available. By evaluating design strategies for effectively leveraging multiple modalities, we identify key challenges and introduce MGR-LF++, an enhanced late fusion framework that employs contrastive modality alignment and special tokens to denote different modalities, achieving a performance improvement of over 20% compared to single-modality alternatives.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Framework for Evaluating Health Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing complex datasets. Recent studies demonstrate their potential to generate useful, personalized responses when provided with patient-specific health information that encompasses lifestyle, biomarkers, and context. As LLM-driven health applications are increasingly adopted, rigorous and efficient one-sided evaluation methodologies are crucial to ensure response quality across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, personalization and safety. Current evaluation practices for open-ended text responses heavily rely on human experts. This approach introduces human factors and is often cost-prohibitive, labor-intensive, and hinders scalability, especially in complex domains like healthcare where response assessment necessitates domain expertise and considers multifaceted patient data. In this work, we introduce Adaptive Precise Boolean rubrics: an evaluation framework that streamlines human and automated evaluation of open-ended questions by identifying gaps in model responses using a minimal set of targeted rubrics questions. Our approach is based on recent work in more general evaluation settings that contrasts a smaller set of complex evaluation targets with a larger set of more precise, granular targets answerable with simple boolean responses. We validate this approach in metabolic health, a domain encompassing diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. Our results demonstrate that Adaptive Precise Boolean rubrics yield higher inter-rater agreement among expert and non-expert human evaluators, and in automated assessments, compared to traditional Likert scales, while requiring approximately half the evaluation time of Likert-based methods. This enhanced efficiency, particularly in automated evaluation and non-expert contributions, paves the way for more extensive and cost-effective evaluation of LLMs in health.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Are Better Logical Fallacy Reasoners with Counterargument, Explanation, and Goal-Aware Prompt Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has greatly improved our ability to process complex language. However, accurately detecting logical fallacies remains a significant challenge. This study presents a novel and effective prompt formulation approach for logical fallacy detection, applicable in both supervised (fine-tuned) and unsupervised (zero-shot) settings. Our method enriches input text incorporating implicit contextual information -- counterarguments, explanations, and goals -- which we query for validity within the context of the argument. We then rank these queries based on confidence scores to inform classification. We evaluate our approach across multiple datasets from 5 domains, covering 29 distinct fallacy types, using models from the GPT and LLaMA series. The results show substantial improvements over state-of-the-art models, with F1 score increases of up to 0.60 in zero-shot settings and up to 0.45 in fine-tuned models. Extensive analyses further illustrate why and how our method excels.</description>

      <title>What Makes an Evaluation Useful? Common Pitfalls and Best Practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23424</link>

Abstract: Following the rapid increase in Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities in recent years, the AI community has voiced concerns regarding possible safety risks. To support decision-making on the safe use and development of AI systems, there is a growing need for high-quality evaluations of dangerous model capabilities. While several attempts to provide such evaluations have been made, a clear definition of what constitutes a "good evaluation" has yet to be agreed upon. In this practitioners' perspective paper, we present a set of best practices for safety evaluations, drawing on prior work in model evaluation and illustrated through cybersecurity examples. We first discuss the steps of the initial thought process, which connects threat modeling to evaluation design. Then, we provide the characteristics and parameters that make an evaluation useful. Finally, we address additional considerations as we move from building specific evaluations to building a full and comprehensive evaluation suite.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Preserving Transformations as Mutation Operators: A Study on Their Effectiveness in Defect Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in defect detection use language models. Existing works enhanced the training data to improve the models' robustness when applied to semantically identical code (i.e., predictions should be the same). However, the use of semantically identical code has not been considered for improving the tools during their application - a concept closely related to metamorphic testing.
  The goal of our study is to determine whether we can use semantic-preserving transformations, analogue to mutation operators, to improve the performance of defect detection tools in the testing stage. We first collect existing publications which implemented semantic-preserving transformations and share their implementation, such that we can reuse them. We empirically study the effectiveness of three different ensemble strategies for enhancing defect detection tools. We apply the collected transformations on the Devign dataset, considering vulnerabilities as a type of defect, and two fine-tuned large language models for defect detection (VulBERTa, PLBART). We found 28 publications with 94 different transformations.
  We choose to implement 39 transformations from four of the publications, but a manual check revealed that 23 out 39 transformations change code semantics. Using the 16 remaining, correct transformations and three ensemble strategies, we were not able to increase the accuracy of the defect detection models. Our results show that reusing shared semantic-preserving transformation is difficult, sometimes even causing wrongful changes to the semantics.

      <title>Codehacks: A Dataset of Adversarial Tests for Competitive Programming Problems Obtained from Codeforces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software is used in critical applications in our day-to-day life and it is important to ensure its correctness. One popular approach to assess correctness is to evaluate software on tests. If a test fails, it indicates a fault in the software under test; if all tests pass correctly, one may assume that the software is correct. However, the reliability of these results depends on the test suite considered, and there is a risk of false negatives (i.e. software that passes all available tests but contains bugs because some cases are not tested). Therefore, it is important to consider error-inducing test cases when evaluating software.
  To support data-driven creation of such a test-suite, which is especially of interest for testing software synthesized from large language models, we curate a dataset (Codehacks) of programming problems together with corresponding error-inducing test cases (i.e., "hacks"). This dataset is collected from the wild, in particular, from the Codeforces online judge platform. The dataset comprises 288,617 hacks for 5,578 programming problems, each with a natural language description, as well as the source code for 2,196 submitted solutions to these problems that can be broken with their corresponding hacks.

      <title>Benchmarking Systematic Relational Reasoning with Large Language and Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been found to struggle with systematic reasoning. Even on tasks where they appear to perform well, their performance often depends on shortcuts, rather than on genuine reasoning abilities, leading them to collapse on out-of-distribution examples. Post-training strategies based on reinforcement learning and chain-of-thought prompting have recently been hailed as a step change. However, little is still known about the potential of the resulting ``Large Reasoning Models'' (LRMs) beyond problem solving in mathematics and programming, where finding genuine out-of-distribution problems can be difficult. In this paper, we focus on tasks that require systematic reasoning about relational compositions, especially for qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning. These tasks allow us to control the difficulty of problem instances, and measure in a precise way to what extent models can generalise. We find that that the considered LLMs and LRMs overall perform poorly overall, albeit better than random chance.</description>

      <title>KOFFVQA: An Objectively Evaluated Free-form VQA Benchmark for Large Vision-Language Models in the Korean Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent emergence of Large Vision-Language Models(VLMs) has resulted in a variety of different benchmarks for evaluating such models. Despite this, we observe that most existing evaluation methods suffer from the fact that they either require the model to choose from pre-determined responses, sacrificing open-endedness, or evaluate responses using a judge model, resulting in subjective and unreliable evaluation. In addition, we observe a lack of benchmarks for VLMs in the Korean language, which are necessary as a separate metric from more common English language benchmarks, as the performance of generative language models can differ significantly based on the language being used. Therefore, we present KOFFVQA, a general-purpose free-form visual question answering benchmark in the Korean language for the evaluation of VLMs. Our benchmark consists of 275 carefully crafted questions each paired with an image and grading criteria covering 10 different aspects of VLM performance. The grading criteria eliminate the problem of unreliability by allowing the judge model to grade each response based on a pre-determined set of rules. By defining the evaluation criteria in an objective manner, even a small open-source model can be used to evaluate models on our benchmark reliably. In addition to evaluating a large number of existing VLMs on our benchmark, we also experimentally verify that our method of using pre-existing grading criteria for evaluation is much more reliable than existing methods. Our evaluation code is available at https://github.com/maum-ai/KOFFVQA</description>

      <title>Short-video Propagation Influence Rating: A New Real-world Dataset and A New Large Graph Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short-video platforms have gained immense popularity, captivating the interest of millions, if not billions, of users globally. Recently, researchers have highlighted the significance of analyzing the propagation of short-videos, which typically involves discovering commercial values, public opinions, user behaviors, etc. This paper proposes a new Short-video Propagation Influence Rating (SPIR) task and aims to promote SPIR from both the dataset and method perspectives. First, we propose a new Cross-platform Short-Video (XS-Video) dataset, which aims to provide a large-scale and real-world short-video propagation network across various platforms to facilitate the research on short-video propagation. Our XS-Video dataset includes 117,720 videos, 381,926 samples, and 535 topics across 5 biggest Chinese platforms, annotated with the propagation influence from level 0 to 9. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale short-video dataset that contains cross-platform data or provides all of the views, likes, shares, collects, fans, comments, and comment content. Second, we propose a Large Graph Model (LGM) named NetGPT, based on a novel three-stage training mechanism, to bridge heterogeneous graph-structured data with the powerful reasoning ability and knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our NetGPT can comprehend and analyze the short-video propagation graph, enabling it to predict the long-term propagation influence of short-videos. Comprehensive experimental results evaluated by both classification and regression metrics on our XS-Video dataset indicate the superiority of our method for SPIR.</description>

Abstract: This research addresses the question, which characteristics a cognitive architecture must have to leverage the benefits of natural language in Co-Constructive Task Learning (CCTL). To provide context, we first discuss Interactive Task Learning (ITL), the mechanisms of the human memory system, and the significance of natural language and multi-modality. Next, we examine the current state of cognitive architectures, analyzing their capabilities to inform a concept of CCTL grounded in multiple sources. We then integrate insights from various research domains to develop a unified framework. Finally, we conclude by identifying the remaining challenges and requirements necessary to achieve CCTL in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).</description>

      <title>Get the Agents Drunk: Memory Perturbations in Autonomous Agent-based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model-based agents are increasingly used in recommender systems (Agent4RSs) to achieve personalized behavior modeling. Specifically, Agent4RSs introduces memory mechanisms that enable the agents to autonomously learn and self-evolve from real-world interactions. However, to the best of our knowledge, how robust Agent4RSs are remains unexplored. As such, in this paper, we propose the first work to attack Agent4RSs by perturbing agents' memories, not only to uncover their limitations but also to enhance their security and robustness, ensuring the development of safer and more reliable AI agents.
  Given the security and privacy concerns, it is more practical to launch attacks under a black-box setting, where the accurate knowledge of the victim models cannot be easily obtained. Moreover, the practical attacks are often stealthy to maximize the impact. To this end, we propose a novel practical attack framework named DrunkAgent. DrunkAgent consists of a generation module, a strategy module, and a surrogate module. The generation module aims to produce effective and coherent adversarial textual triggers, which can be used to achieve attack objectives such as promoting the target items. The strategy module is designed to `get the target agents drunk' so that their memories cannot be effectively updated during the interaction process. As such, the triggers can play the best role. Both of the modules are optimized on the surrogate module to improve the transferability and imperceptibility of the attacks. By identifying and analyzing the vulnerabilities, our work provides critical insights that pave the way for building safer and more resilient Agent4RSs. Extensive experiments across various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DrunkAgent.</description>

      <title>Grounding Agent Reasoning in Image Schemas: A Neurosymbolic Approach to Embodied Cognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite advances in embodied AI, agent reasoning systems still struggle to capture the fundamental conceptual structures that humans naturally use to understand and interact with their environment. To address this, we propose a novel framework that bridges embodied cognition theory and agent systems by leveraging a formal characterization of image schemas, which are defined as recurring patterns of sensorimotor experience that structure human cognition. By customizing LLMs to translate natural language descriptions into formal representations based on these sensorimotor patterns, we will be able to create a neurosymbolic system that grounds the agent's understanding in fundamental conceptual structures. We argue that such an approach enhances both efficiency and interpretability while enabling more intuitive human-agent interactions through shared embodied understanding.</description>

      <title>MB-ORES: A Multi-Branch Object Reasoner for Visual Grounding in Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework that integrates object detection (OD) and visual grounding (VG) for remote sensing (RS) imagery. To support conventional OD and establish an intuitive prior for VG task, we fine-tune an open-set object detector using referring expression data, framing it as a partially supervised OD task. In the first stage, we construct a graph representation of each image, comprising object queries, class embeddings, and proposal locations. Then, our task-aware architecture processes this graph to perform the VG task. The model consists of: (i) a multi-branch network that integrates spatial, visual, and categorical features to generate task-aware proposals, and (ii) an object reasoning network that assigns probabilities across proposals, followed by a soft selection mechanism for final referring object localization. Our model demonstrates superior performance on the OPT-RSVG and DIOR-RSVG datasets, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods while retaining classical OD capabilities. The code will be available in our repository: \url{https://github.com/rd20karim/MB-ORES}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In e-commerce, behavioral data is collected for decision making which can be costly and slow. Simulation with LLM powered agents is emerging as a promising alternative for representing human population behavior. However, LLMs are known to exhibit certain biases, such as brand bias, review rating bias and limited representation of certain groups in the population, hence they need to be carefully benchmarked and aligned to user behavior. Ultimately, our goal is to synthesise an agent population and verify that it collectively approximates a real sample of humans. To this end, we propose a framework that: (i) creates synthetic shopping agents by automatically mining personas from anonymised historical shopping data, (ii) equips agents with retail-specific tools to synthesise shopping sessions and (iii) introduces a novel alignment suite measuring distributional differences between humans and shopping agents at the group (i.e. population) level rather than the traditional "individual" level. Experimental results demonstrate that using personas improves performance on the alignment suite, though a gap remains to human behaviour. We showcase an initial application of our framework for automated agentic A/B testing and compare the findings to human results. Finally, we discuss applications, limitations and challenges setting the stage for impactful future work.</description>

      <title>MaintainCoder: Maintainable Code Generation Under Dynamic Requirements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern code generation has made significant strides in functional correctness and execution efficiency. However, these systems often overlook a critical dimension in real-world software development: maintainability. To handle dynamic requirements with minimal rework, we propose MaintainCoder as a pioneering solution. It integrates Waterfall model, design patterns, and multi-agent collaboration to systematically enhance cohesion, reduce coupling, and improve adaptability. We also introduce MaintainBench, a benchmark comprising requirement changes and corresponding dynamic metrics on maintainance effort. Experiments demonstrate that existing code generation methods struggle to meet maintainability standards when requirements evolve. In contrast, MaintainCoder improves maintainability metrics by 14-30% with even higher correctness, i.e. pass@k. Our work not only provides the foundation of maintainable code generation, but also highlights the need for more holistic code quality research.

      <title>Rec-R1: Bridging Generative Large Language Models and User-Centric Recommendation Systems via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Rec-R1, a general reinforcement learning framework that bridges large language models (LLMs) with recommendation systems through closed-loop optimization. Unlike prompting and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Rec-R1 directly optimizes LLM generation using feedback from a fixed black-box recommendation model, without relying on synthetic SFT data from proprietary models such as GPT-4o. This avoids the substantial cost and effort required for data distillation. To verify the effectiveness of Rec-R1, we evaluate it on two representative tasks: product search and sequential recommendation. Experimental results demonstrate that Rec-R1 not only consistently outperforms prompting- and SFT-based methods, but also achieves significant gains over strong discriminative baselines, even when used with simple retrievers such as BM25. Moreover, Rec-R1 preserves the general-purpose capabilities of the LLM, unlike SFT, which often impairs instruction-following and reasoning. These findings suggest Rec-R1 as a promising foundation for continual task-specific adaptation without catastrophic forgetting.</description>

      <title>Open-Reasoner-Zero: An Open Source Approach to Scaling Up Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Open-Reasoner-Zero, the first open source implementation of large-scale reasoning-oriented RL training focusing on scalability, simplicity and accessibility. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a minimalist approach, vanilla PPO with GAE ($\lambda=1$, $\gamma=1$) and straightforward rule-based rewards, without any KL regularization, is sufficient to scale up both response length and benchmark performance, similar to the phenomenon observed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. Using the same base model as DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B, our implementation achieves superior performance on AIME2024, MATH500, and the GPQA Diamond benchmark while demonstrating remarkable efficiency -- requiring only a tenth of the training steps, compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero pipeline. In the spirit of open source, we release our source code, parameter settings, training data, and model weights across various sizes.</description>

      <title>ORAL: Prompting Your Large-Scale LoRAs via Conditional Recurrent Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter generation has emerged as a novel paradigm for neural network development, offering an alternative to traditional neural network training by synthesizing high-quality model weights directly. In the context of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for evolving ($\textit{i.e.}$, constantly updated) large language models (LLMs), this approach promises efficient adaptation without costly retraining. However, existing methods face critical limitations in simultaneously achieving scalability and controllability. In this paper, we introduce $\texttt{ORAL}$, a novel $\textbf{conditional recurrent diffusion}$ framework that addresses these challenges. $\texttt{ORAL}$ incorporates a novel conditioning mechanism that integrates model architecture and textual task specifications, enabling the generation of task-specific LoRA parameters that can seamlessly transfer across evolving foundation models. Our approach successfully scales to billions-of-parameter LLMs and maintains controllability. Through extensive experiments across seven language tasks, four vision tasks, and three multimodal tasks using five pre-trained LLMs, we demonstrate that $\texttt{ORAL}$ generates high-quality LoRA parameters that achieve comparable or superior performance to vanilla trained counterparts.</description>

      <title>SQuat: Subspace-orthogonal KV Cache Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache accelerates LLMs decoding by storing KV tensors from previously generated tokens. It reduces redundant computation at the cost of increased memory usage. To mitigate this overhead, existing approaches compress KV tensors into lower-bit representations; however, quantization errors can accumulate as more tokens are generated, potentially resulting in undesired outputs. In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache quantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to capture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor quantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and original keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of quantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs. SQuat requires no model fine-tuning, no additional calibration dataset for offline learning, and is grounded in a theoretical framework we develop. Through numerical experiments, we show that our method reduces peak memory by 2.17 to 2.82, improves throughput by 2.45 to 3.60, and achieves more favorable benchmark scores than existing KV cache quantization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Effectively Controlling Reasoning Models through Thinking Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning-enhanced large language models (LLMs) explicitly generate intermediate reasoning steps prior to generating final answers, helping the model excel in complex problem-solving. In this paper, we demonstrate that this emerging generation framework offers a unique opportunity for more fine-grained control over model behavior. We propose Thinking Intervention, a novel paradigm designed to explicitly guide the internal reasoning processes of LLMs by strategically inserting or revising specific thinking tokens. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple tasks, including instruction following on IFEval, instruction hierarchy on SEP, and safety alignment on XSTest and SORRY-Bench. Our results demonstrate that Thinking Intervention significantly outperforms baseline prompting approaches, achieving up to 6.7% accuracy gains in instruction-following scenarios, 15.4% improvements in reasoning about instruction hierarchies, and a 40.0% increase in refusal rates for unsafe prompts using open-source DeepSeek R1 models. Overall, our work opens a promising new research avenue for controlling reasoning LLMs.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Effect of Reinforcement Learning on Video Understanding: Insights from SEED-Bench-R1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Chain of Thought (COT) generation have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as an effective post-training approach. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) inherit this reasoning potential but remain underexplored in tasks requiring both perception and logical reasoning. To address this, we introduce SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate post-training methods for MLLMs in video understanding. It includes intricate real-world videos and complex everyday planning tasks in the format of multiple-choice questions, requiring sophisticated perception and reasoning. SEED-Bench-R1 assesses generalization through a three-level hierarchy: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios, equipped with a large-scale training dataset with easily verifiable ground-truth answers. Using Qwen2-VL-Instruct-7B as a base model, we compare RL with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), demonstrating RL's data efficiency and superior performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, even outperforming SFT on general video understanding benchmarks like LongVideoBench. Our detailed analysis reveals that RL enhances visual perception but often produces less logically coherent reasoning chains. We identify key limitations such as inconsistent reasoning and overlooked visual cues, and suggest future improvements in base model reasoning, reward modeling, and RL robustness against noisy signals.</description>

      <title>RIG: Synergizing Reasoning and Imagination in End-to-End Generalist Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning before action and imagining potential outcomes (i.e., world models) are essential for embodied agents operating in complex open-world environments. Yet, prior work either incorporates only one of these abilities in an end-to-end agent or integrates multiple specialized models into an agent system, limiting the learning efficiency and generalization of the policy. Thus, this paper makes the first attempt to synergize Reasoning and Imagination in an end-to-end Generalist policy, termed RIG. To train RIG in an end-to-end manner, we construct a data pipeline that progressively integrates and enriches the content of imagination and reasoning in the trajectories collected from existing agents. The joint learning of reasoning and next image generation explicitly models the inherent correlation between reasoning, action, and dynamics of environments, and thus exhibits more than $17\times$ sample efficiency improvements and generalization in comparison with previous works. During inference, RIG first reasons about the next action, produces potential action, and then predicts the action outcomes, which offers the agent a chance to review and self-correct based on the imagination before taking real actions. Experimental results show that the synergy of reasoning and imagination not only improves the robustness, generalization, and interoperability of generalist policy but also enables test-time scaling to enhance overall performance.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have recently demonstrated their remarkable abilities of communicating with human users. In this technical report, we take an initiative to investigate their capacities of playing text games, in which a player has to understand the environment and respond to situations by having dialogues with the game world. Our experiments show that ChatGPT performs competitively compared to all the existing systems but still exhibits a low level of intelligence. Precisely, ChatGPT can not construct the world model by playing the game or even reading the game manual; it may fail to leverage the world knowledge that it already has; it cannot infer the goal of each step as the game progresses. Our results open up new research questions at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing.</description>

Abstract: The power of large language models (LLMs) has been demonstrated through numerous data and computing resources. However, the application of language models on mobile devices is facing huge challenge on the computation and memory costs, that is, tiny language models with high performance are urgently required. Limited by the highly complex training process, there are many details for optimizing language models that are seldom studied carefully. In this study, based on a tiny language model with 1B parameters, we carefully design a series of empirical study to analyze the effect of each component. Three perspectives are mainly discussed, \ie, neural architecture, parameter initialization, and optimization strategy. Several design formulas are empirically proved especially effective for tiny language models, including tokenizer compression, architecture tweaking, parameter inheritance and multiple-round training. Then we train PanGu-$\pi$-1B Pro and PanGu-$\pi$-1.5B Pro on 1.6T multilingual corpora, following the established formulas. Experimental results demonstrate the improved optimization and architecture yield a notable average improvement of 8.87 on benchmark evaluation sets for PanGu-$\pi$-1B Pro. Besides, PanGu-$\pi$-1.5B Pro surpasses a range of SOTA models with larger model sizes, validating its superior performance.

      <title>Punctuation Restoration Improves Structure Understanding Without Supervision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08382v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsupervised learning objectives like autoregressive and masked language modeling constitute a significant part in producing pre-trained representations that perform various downstream applications from natural language understanding to conversational tasks. However, despite impressive generative capabilities of recent large language models, their abilities to capture syntactic or semantic structure within text lag behind. We hypothesize that the mismatch between linguistic performance and competence in machines is attributable to insufficient learning of linguistic structure knowledge via currently popular pre-training objectives. Working with English, we show that punctuation restoration as a learning objective improves performance on structure-related tasks like named entity recognition, open information extraction, chunking, and part-of-speech tagging. Punctuation restoration results in $\blacktriangle$$\geq2\%$p improvement in 16 out of 18 experiments, across 6 out of 7 tasks. Our results show that punctuation restoration is an effective learning objective that can improve structure understanding and yield a more robust structure-aware representations of natural language in base-sized models.</description>

      <title>LLMs Are Not Intelligent Thinkers: Introducing Mathematical Topic Tree Benchmark for Comprehensive Evaluation of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in mathematical reasoning. However, despite these achievements, current evaluations are mostly limited to specific mathematical topics, and it remains unclear whether LLMs are genuinely engaging in reasoning. To address these gaps, we present the Mathematical Topics Tree (MaTT) benchmark, a challenging and structured benchmark that offers 1,958 questions across a wide array of mathematical subjects, each paired with a detailed hierarchical chain of topics. Upon assessing different LLMs using the MaTT benchmark, we find that the most advanced model, GPT-4, achieved a mere 54\% accuracy in a multiple-choice scenario. Interestingly, even when employing Chain-of-Thought prompting, we observe mostly no notable improvement. Moreover, LLMs accuracy dramatically reduced by up to 24.2 percentage point when the questions were presented without providing choices. Further detailed analysis of the LLMs' performance across a range of topics showed significant discrepancy even for closely related subtopics within the same general mathematical area. In an effort to pinpoint the reasons behind LLMs performances, we conducted a manual evaluation of the completeness and correctness of the explanations generated by GPT-4 when choices were available. Surprisingly, we find that in only 53.3\% of the instances where the model provided a correct answer, the accompanying explanations were deemed complete and accurate, i.e., the model engaged in genuine reasoning.</description>

      <title>In-Context Editing: Learning Knowledge from Self-Induced Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11194v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In scenarios where language models must incorporate new information efficiently without extensive retraining, traditional fine-tuning methods are prone to overfitting, degraded generalization, and unnatural language generation. To address these limitations, we introduce Consistent In-Context Editing (ICE), a novel approach leveraging the model's in-context learning capability to optimize toward a contextual distribution rather than a one-hot target. ICE introduces a simple yet effective optimization framework for the model to internalize new knowledge by aligning its output distributions with and without additional context. This method enhances the robustness and effectiveness of gradient-based tuning methods, preventing overfitting and preserving the model's integrity. We analyze ICE across four critical aspects of knowledge editing: accuracy, locality, generalization, and linguistic quality, demonstrating its advantages. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of ICE and demonstrate its potential for continual editing, ensuring that the integrity of the model is preserved while updating information.</description>

      <title>Cascade Reward Sampling for Efficient Decoding-Time Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is essential for their applications. Recently, decoding-time alignment has emerged as an effective plug-and-play technique that avoids fine-tuning model parameters. This approach retains the general utility of pretrained LLMs but often suffers from significant inefficiencies during decoding, primarily due to wasted token generation and excessive reward evaluations. To address these challenges, we introduce Cascade Reward Sampling (CARDS) to resolve both efficiency bottlenecks in decoding-time alignment. Specifically, we develop a segment-level rejection sampling algorithm that minimizes redundant computations of both LLMs and reward models (RMs). Central to CARDS is an uncertainty-based segmentation mechanism, which ensures the accuracy of RMs evaluations on incomplete segments. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of reward scores on segments to elucidate the improved alignment performance. Experimental results demonstrate that CARDS significantly improves decoding efficiency, alignment quality, and general utility compared to existing decoding-time alignment methods, achieving approximately a 70% reduction in decoding time and over 90% win-ties in utility and safety benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Exponential Context Extension via Cascading KV Cache</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17808v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transformer's context window is vital for tasks such as few-shot learning and conditional generation as it preserves previous tokens for active memory. However, as the context lengths increase, the computational costs grow quadratically, hindering the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world, long sequence scenarios. Although some recent key-value caching (KV Cache) methods offer linear inference complexity, they naively manage the stored context, prematurely evicting tokens and losing valuable information. Moreover, they lack an optimized prefill/prompt stage strategy, resulting in higher latency than even quadratic attention for realistic context sizes. In response, we introduce a novel mechanism that leverages cascading sub-cache buffers to selectively retain the most relevant tokens, enabling the model to maintain longer context histories without increasing the cache size. Our approach outperforms linear caching baselines across key benchmarks, including streaming perplexity, question answering, book summarization, and passkey retrieval, where it retains better retrieval accuracy at 1M tokens after four doublings of the cache size of 65K. Additionally, our method reduces prefill stage latency by a factor of 6.8 when compared to flash attention on 1M tokens. These innovations not only enhance the computational efficiency of LLMs but also pave the way for their effective deployment in resource-constrained environments, enabling large-scale, real-time applications with significantly reduced latency.</description>

      <title>PQCache: Product Quantization-based KVCache for Long Context LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to evolve, the context length in inference is steadily growing. Key-Value Cache (KVCache), the intermediate representations of tokens within LLM inference, has now become the primary memory bottleneck due to limited GPU memory. Current methods selectively determine suitable keys and values for self-attention computation in LLMs to address the issue. However, they either fall short in maintaining model quality or result in high serving latency. Drawing inspiration from advanced embedding retrieval techniques prevalent in the data management community, we consider the storage and retrieval of KVCache as a typical embedding retrieval problem. We propose PQCache, which employs Product Quantization (PQ) to manage KVCache, maintaining model quality while ensuring low serving latency. During the prefilling phase, we apply PQ to tokens' keys for each LLM layer and head. During the autoregressive decoding phase, we use PQ codes and centroids to approximately identify important preceding tokens, then fetch the corresponding key-value pairs for self-attention computation. Through meticulous design of overlapping and caching, we minimize any additional computation and communication overhead during both phases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQCache achieves both effectiveness and efficiency, with 4.60% score improvement over existing methods on InfiniteBench and low system latency in both prefilling and decoding.</description>

Abstract: Hallucination, a phenomenon where large language models (LLMs) produce output that is factually incorrect or unrelated to the input, is a major challenge for LLM applications that require accuracy and dependability. In this paper, we introduce a reliable and high-speed production system aimed at detecting and rectifying the hallucination issue within LLMs. Our system encompasses named entity recognition (NER), natural language inference (NLI), span-based detection (SBD), and an intricate decision tree-based process to reliably detect a wide range of hallucinations in LLM responses. Furthermore, we have crafted a rewriting mechanism that maintains an optimal mix of precision, response time, and cost-effectiveness. We detail the core elements of our framework and underscore the paramount challenges tied to response time, availability, and performance metrics, which are crucial for real-world deployment of these technologies. Our extensive evaluation, utilizing offline data and live production traffic, confirms the efficacy of our proposed framework and service.</description>

      <title>Banyan: Improved Representation Learning with Explicit Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17771v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Banyan, a model that efficiently learns semantic representations by leveraging explicit hierarchical structure. While transformers excel at scale, they struggle in low-resource settings. Conversely recent structured models have shown promise as efficient learners, but lack performance. Banyan bridges this gap with two key innovations: an entangled hierarchical tree structure and diagonalized message passing, enabling it to outperform larger transformer models with just 14 non-embedding parameters. It excels in low-resource settings, offering a viable alternative for under-represented languages and highlighting its potential for efficient, interpretable NLP in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>LLM Stability: A detailed analysis with some surprises</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04667v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM (large language model) practitioners commonly notice that outputs can vary for the same inputs under settings expected to be deterministic. Yet the questions of how pervasive this is, and with what impact on results, have not to our knowledge been systematically investigated. We investigate non-determinism in five LLMs configured to be deterministic when applied to eight common tasks in across 10 runs, in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. We see accuracy variations up to 15% across naturally occurring runs with a gap of best possible performance to worst possible performance up to 70%. In fact, none of the LLMs consistently delivers repeatable accuracy across all tasks, much less identical output strings. Sharing preliminary results with insiders has revealed that non-determinism perhaps essential to the efficient use of compute resources via co-mingled data in input buffers so this issue is not going away anytime soon. To better quantify our observations, we introduce metrics focused on quantifying determinism, TARr@N for the total agreement rate at N runs over raw output, and TARa@N for total agreement rate of parsed-out answers. Our code and data are publicly available at http://github.com/REDACTED.</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Model for Photo-Sharing Multi-modal Dialogue Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photo-Sharing Multi-modal dialogue generation requires a dialogue agent not only to generate text responses but also to share photos at the proper moment. Using image text caption as the bridge, a pipeline model integrates an image caption model, a text generation model, and an image generation model to handle this complex multi-modal task. However, representing the images with text captions may loss important visual details and information and cause error propagation in the complex dialogue system. Besides, the pipeline model isolates the three models separately because discrete image text captions hinder end-to-end gradient propagation. We propose the first end-to-end model for photo-sharing multi-modal dialogue generation, which integrates an image perceptron and an image generator with a large language model. The large language model employs the Q-Former to perceive visual images in the input end. For image generation in the output end, we propose a dynamic vocabulary transformation matrix and use straight-through and gumbel-softmax techniques to align the large language model and stable diffusion model and achieve end-to-end gradient propagation. We perform experiments on PhotoChat and DialogCC datasets to evaluate our end-to-end model. Compared with pipeline models, the end-to-end model gains state-of-the-art performances on various metrics of text and image generation. More analysis experiments also verify the effectiveness of the end-to-end model for photo-sharing multi-modal dialogue generation.</description>

      <title>Systematic Evaluation of LLM-as-a-Judge in LLM Alignment Tasks: Explainable Metrics and Diverse Prompt Templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has been widely applied to evaluate and compare different LLM alignmnet approaches (e.g., RLHF and DPO). However, concerns regarding its reliability have emerged, due to LLM judges' biases and inconsistent decision-making. Previous research has developed evaluation frameworks to assess reliability of LLM judges and their alignment with human preferences. However, the employed evaluation metrics often lack adequate explainability and fail to address LLM internal inconsistency. Additionally, existing studies inadequately explore the impact of various prompt templates when applying LLM-as-a-Judge methods, leading to potentially inconsistent comparisons between different alignment algorithms. In this work, we systematically evaluate LLM-as-a-Judge on alignment tasks by defining more theoretically interpretable evaluation metrics and explicitly mitigating LLM internal inconsistency from reliability metrics. We develop an open-source framework to evaluate, compare, and visualize the reliability and alignment of LLM judges, which facilitates practitioners to choose LLM judges for alignment tasks. In the experiments, we examine effects of diverse prompt templates on LLM-judge reliability and also demonstrate our developed framework by comparing various LLM judges on two common alignment datasets (i.e., TL;DR Summarization and HH-RLHF-Helpfulness). Our results indicate a significant impact of prompt templates on LLM judge performance, as well as a mediocre alignment level between the tested LLM judges and human evaluators.</description>

      <title>On the Diagram of Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities but struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing methods often tackle this by requiring external control mechanisms or multi-model orchestration, which introduces system complexity and typically lacks formal guarantees of reasoning soundness. We introduce the Diagram of Thought (DoT), a framework wherein a single auto-regressive LLM internally constructs and navigates a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This DAG represents the iterative reasoning process, encompassing steps like proposing ideas, critiquing them, refining based on feedback, and synthesizing conclusions. This self-orchestrated, self-contained process is guided by learned role-specific tokens (e.g., &lt;proposer&gt;, &lt;critic&gt;, &lt;summarizer&gt;) embedded within the standard generation loop, thereby eliminating external dependencies. Crucially, we establish a rigorous mathematical foundation for DoT using Topos Theory. We formalize the reasoning DAG as a diagram within a suitable topos and prove that the final synthesis step, aggregating validated information, corresponds semantically to computing the colimit of the relevant sub-diagram. This formalization provides theoretical guarantees concerning the logical consistency and robustness of the synthesized outcome. DoT thus offers a unified, self-contained, interpretable, efficient, and formally grounded approach designed to significantly advance the complex reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Says Who? Effective Zero-Shot Annotation of Focalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Focalization, the perspective through which narrative is presented, is encoded via a wide range of lexico-grammatical features and is subject to reader interpretation. Even trained annotators frequently disagree on correct labels, suggesting this task is both qualitatively and computationally challenging. In this work, we test how well five contemporary large language model (LLM) families and two baselines perform when annotating short literary excerpts for focalization. Despite the challenging nature of the task, we find that LLMs show comparable performance to trained human annotators, with GPT-4o achieving an average F1 of 84.79%. Further, we demonstrate that the log probabilities output by GPT-family models frequently reflect the difficulty of annotating particular excerpts. Finally, we provide a case study analyzing sixteen Stephen King novels, demonstrating the usefulness of this approach for computational literary studies and the insights gleaned from examining focalization at scale.</description>

      <title>DiMB-RE: Mining the Scientific Literature for Diet-Microbiome Associations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: To develop a corpus annotated for diet-microbiome associations from the biomedical literature and train natural language processing (NLP) models to identify these associations, thereby improving the understanding of their role in health and disease, and supporting personalized nutrition strategies. Materials and Methods: We constructed DiMB-RE, a comprehensive corpus annotated with 15 entity types (e.g., Nutrient, Microorganism) and 13 relation types (e.g., INCREASES, IMPROVES) capturing diet-microbiome associations. We fine-tuned and evaluated state-of-the-art NLP models for named entity, trigger, and relation extraction as well as factuality detection using DiMB-RE. In addition, we benchmarked two generative large language models (GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o) on a subset of the dataset in zero- and one-shot settings. Results: DiMB-RE consists of 14,450 entities and 4,206 relationships from 165 publications (including 30 full-text Results sections). Fine-tuned NLP models performed reasonably well for named entity recognition (0.800 F1 score), while end-to-end relation extraction performance was modest (0.445 F1). The use of Results section annotations improved relation extraction. The impact of trigger detection was mixed. Generative models showed lower accuracy compared to fine-tuned models. Discussion: To our knowledge, DiMB-RE is the largest and most diverse corpus focusing on diet-microbiome interactions. NLP models fine-tuned on DiMB-RE exhibit lower performance compared to similar corpora, highlighting the complexity of information extraction in this domain. Misclassified entities, missed triggers, and cross-sentence relations are the major sources of relation extraction errors. Conclusions: DiMB-RE can serve as a benchmark corpus for biomedical literature mining. DiMB-RE and the NLP models are available at https://github.com/ScienceNLP-Lab/DiMB-RE.</description>

      <title>Seeing Eye to AI: Human Alignment via Gaze-Based Response Rewards for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), have led to the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, Llama, Claude, and Gemini, which excel across a range of tasks but require extensive fine-tuning to align their outputs with human expectations. A widely used method for achieving this alignment is Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which, despite its success, faces challenges in accurately modelling human preferences. In this paper, we introduce GazeReward, a novel framework that integrates implicit feedback -- and specifically eye-tracking (ET) data -- into the Reward Model (RM). In addition, we explore how ET-based features can provide insights into user preferences. Through ablation studies we test our framework with different integration methods, LLMs, and ET generator models, demonstrating that our approach significantly improves the accuracy of the RM on established human preference datasets. This work advances the ongoing discussion on optimizing AI alignment with human values, exploring the potential of cognitive data for shaping future NLP research.</description>

      <title>ToolGen: Unified Tool Retrieval and Calling via Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, their inability to autonomously execute tasks by directly interacting with external tools remains a critical limitation. Traditional methods rely on inputting tool descriptions as context, which is constrained by context length and requires separate, often inefficient, retrieval mechanisms. We introduce ToolGen, a paradigm shift that integrates tool knowledge directly into the LLM's parameters by representing each tool as a unique token. This enables the LLM to generate tool calls and arguments as part of its next token prediction capabilities, seamlessly blending tool invocation with language generation. Our framework allows the LLM to access and utilize a vast amount of tools with no additional retrieval step, significantly enhancing both performance and scalability. Experimental results with over 47,000 tools show that ToolGen not only achieves superior results in both tool retrieval and autonomous task completion but also sets the stage for a new era of AI agents that can adapt to tools across diverse domains. By fundamentally transforming tool retrieval into a generative process, ToolGen paves the way for more versatile, efficient, and autonomous AI systems. ToolGen enables end-to-end tool learning and opens opportunities for integration with other advanced techniques such as chain-of-thought and reinforcement learning, thereby expanding the practical capabilities of LLMs.</description>

      <title>ScienceAgentBench: Toward Rigorous Assessment of Language Agents for Data-Driven Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05080v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advancements of large language models (LLMs) have piqued growing interest in developing LLM-based language agents to automate scientific discovery end-to-end, which has sparked both excitement and skepticism about their true capabilities. In this work, we call for rigorous assessment of agents on individual tasks in a scientific workflow before making bold claims on end-to-end automation. To this end, we present ScienceAgentBench, a new benchmark for evaluating language agents for data-driven scientific discovery. To ensure the scientific authenticity and real-world relevance of our benchmark, we extract 102 tasks from 44 peer-reviewed publications in four disciplines and engage nine subject matter experts to validate them. We unify the target output for every task to a self-contained Python program file and employ an array of evaluation metrics to examine the generated programs, execution results, and costs. Each task goes through multiple rounds of manual validation by annotators and subject matter experts to ensure its annotation quality and scientific plausibility. We also propose two effective strategies to mitigate data contamination concerns. Using ScienceAgentBench, we evaluate five open-weight and proprietary LLMs, each with three frameworks: direct prompting, OpenHands CodeAct, and self-debug. Given three attempts for each task, the best-performing agent can only solve 32.4% of the tasks independently and 34.3% with expert-provided knowledge. In addition, we evaluate OpenAI o1-preview with direct prompting and self-debug, which can boost the performance to 42.2%, demonstrating the effectiveness of increasing inference-time compute but with more than 10 times the cost of other LLMs. Still, our results underscore the limitations of current language agents in generating code for data-driven discovery, let alone end-to-end automation for scientific research.</description>

      <title>SwiftCoder: Enhancing Code Generation in Large Language Models through Efficiency-Aware Fine-tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) play an increasingly important role in code generation, enhancing both correctness and efficiency has become crucial. Current methods primarily focus on correctness, often overlooking efficiency. To address this gap, we introduce \dataset to improve both aspects by fine-tuning LLMs on a high-quality dataset comprising correct and efficient code samples. Our methodology involves leveraging multiple LLMs to generate diverse candidate code solutions for various tasks across different programming languages. We then evaluate these solutions by directly measuring their execution time and memory usage through local execution. The code solution with the lowest execution time and memory consumption is selected as the final output for each task. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements when fine-tuning with \dataset. For instance, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct's pass@1 score increases from 44.8\% to 57.7\%, while the average execution time for correct tasks decreases by 48.4\%. \dataset offers a scalable and effective solution for advancing AI-driven code generation, benefiting both software development and computational problem-solving.

      <title>PortLLM: Personalizing Evolving Large Language Models with Training-Free and Portable Model Patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly shape the AI landscape, fine-tuning pretrained models has become more popular than in the pre-LLM era for achieving optimal performance in domain-specific tasks. However, pretrained LLMs such as ChatGPT are periodically evolved, i.e., model parameters are frequently updated), making it challenging for downstream users with limited resources to keep up with fine-tuning the newest LLMs for their domain application. Even though fine-tuning costs have nowadays been reduced thanks to the innovations of parameter-efficient fine-tuning such as LoRA, not all downstream users have adequate computing for frequent personalization. Moreover, access to fine-tuning datasets, particularly in sensitive domains such as healthcare, could be time-restrictive, making it crucial to retain the knowledge encoded in earlier fine-tuned rounds for future adaptation. In this paper, we present PortLLM, a training-free framework that (i) creates an initial lightweight model update patch to capture domain-specific knowledge, and (ii) allows a subsequent seamless plugging for the continual personalization of evolved LLM at minimal cost. Our extensive experiments cover seven representative datasets, from easier question-answering tasks {BoolQ, SST2} to harder reasoning tasks {WinoGrande, GSM8K}, and models including {Mistral-7B, Llama2, Llama3.1, and Gemma2}, validating the portability of our designed model patches and showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed framework. For instance, PortLLM achieves comparable performance to LoRA fine-tuning with reductions of up to 12.2x in GPU memory usage. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications to understand the portability of our model update patches, which offers new insights into the theoretical dimension of LLMs' personalization.</description>

      <title>debiaSAE: Benchmarking and Mitigating Vision-Language Model Bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) gain widespread use, their fairness remains under-explored. In this paper, we analyze demographic biases across five models and six datasets. We find that portrait datasets like UTKFace and CelebA are the best tools for bias detection, finding gaps in performance and fairness for both LLaVa and CLIP models. Scene-based datasets like PATA and VLStereoSet fail to be useful benchmarks for bias due to their text prompts allowing the model to guess the answer without a picture. As for pronoun-based datasets like VisoGender, we receive mixed signals as only some subsets of the data are useful in providing insights. To alleviate these two problems, we introduce a more rigorous evaluation dataset and a debiasing method based on Sparse Autoencoders to help reduce bias in models. We find that our data set generates more meaningful errors than the previous data sets. Furthermore, our debiasing method improves fairness, gaining 5-15 points in performance over the baseline. This study displays the problems with the current benchmarks for measuring demographic bias in Vision Language Models and introduces both a more effective dataset for measuring bias and a novel and interpretable debiasing method based on Sparse Autoencoders.</description>

      <title>Web Agents with World Models: Learning and Leveraging Environment Dynamics in Web Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently gained much attention in building autonomous agents. However, the performance of current LLM-based web agents in long-horizon tasks is far from optimal, often yielding errors such as repeatedly buying a non-refundable flight ticket. By contrast, humans can avoid such an irreversible mistake, as we have an awareness of the potential outcomes (e.g., losing money) of our actions, also known as the "world model". Motivated by this, our study first starts with preliminary analyses, confirming the absence of world models in current LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, etc.). Then, we present a World-model-augmented (WMA) web agent, which simulates the outcomes of its actions for better decision-making. To overcome the challenges in training LLMs as world models predicting next observations, such as repeated elements across observations and long HTML inputs, we propose a transition-focused observation abstraction, where the prediction objectives are free-form natural language descriptions exclusively highlighting important state differences between time steps. Experiments on WebArena and Mind2Web show that our world models improve agents' policy selection without training and demonstrate our agents' cost- and time-efficiency compared to recent tree-search-based agents.</description>

      <title>MIRAGE-Bench: Automatic Multilingual Benchmark Arena for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) benchmarks evaluate systems using heuristic-based metrics, but these require human preferences as the ground truth for reference. In contrast, arena-based benchmarks, where systems compete against each other, require an expensive large language model (LLM) as a judge for a reliable evaluation. We present a simple efficient technique to combine the best of both worlds. The idea is to train a surrogate judge using heuristic metrics as input, to output the LLM as a judge prediction. In our work, we develop MIRAGE-Bench, a synthetic arena-based RAG benchmark for 18 diverse languages on Wikipedia focused on multilingual answer generation evaluation. It extensively couples both heuristic features and LLM as a judge for evaluation. We benchmark 19 multilingual LLMs, and observe a high correlation (Kendall Tau ($\tau$) = 0.909) using our surrogate judge and between GPT-4o as a teacher using the Bradley-Terry framework. Our results show proprietary and large open-source LLMs currently dominate on MIRAGE-Bench. Our code and datasets are made publicly available here: https://github.com/vectara/mirage-bench.</description>

      <title>MM-Eval: A Multilingual Meta-Evaluation Benchmark for LLM-as-a-Judge and Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are now capable of producing fluent and coherent content in languages other than English, it is not imperative to precisely evaluate these non-English outputs. However, when assessing the outputs from mutlilingual LLMs, prior works often employed LLM based evaluators that excel at assessing English outputs, without a thorough examination of whether these evaluators could effectively assess non-English text as well. Moreover, existing benchmarks to test evaluator LLMs (referred to as "meta-evaluation benchmarks") are mostly English-centric. To bridge this gap and examine whether evaluator LLMs can reliably assess the outputs of multilingual LLMs, we introduce MM-Eval, a multilingual meta-evaluation benchmark comprising five core subsets covering 18 languages and a Language Consistency subset spanning 122 languages. A core attribute of MM-Eval is that, instead of merely translating existing English meta-evaluation benchmarks, it is designed with multilingual-specific challenges in mind. Additionally, unlike existing meta-evaluation benchmarks that focus solely on ranking accuracy over pairwise data, MM-Eval also evaluates the consistency and fairness of absolute score values across a wide range of languages. Our results show that existing evaluator LLMs that excel in English contexts have considerable room for improvement when assessing non-English outputs. Furthermore, we find that evaluators are unfair and inconsistent when evaluating lower-resourced languages. Finally, we validate MM-Eval by measuring its correlation with Best-of-N rankings, finding a significantly stronger correlation compared to other meta-evaluation benchmarks. We publicly release our benchmark and code.</description>

      <title>Monolingual and Multilingual Misinformation Detection for Low-Resource Languages: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In today's global digital landscape, misinformation transcends linguistic boundaries, posing a significant challenge for moderation systems. Most approaches to misinformation detection are monolingual, focused on high-resource languages, i.e., a handful of world languages that have benefited from substantial research investment. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current research on misinformation detection in low-resource languages, both in monolingual and multilingual settings. We review existing datasets, methodologies, and tools used in these domains, identifying key challenges related to: data resources, model development, cultural and linguistic context, and real-world applications. We examine emerging approaches, such as language-generalizable models and multi-modal techniques, and emphasize the need for improved data collection practices, interdisciplinary collaboration, and stronger incentives for socially responsible AI research. Our findings underscore the importance of systems capable of addressing misinformation across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.</description>

      <title>Have LLMs Reopened the Pandora's Box of AI-Generated Fake News?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of AI-generated content spewed at scale from large language models (LLMs), genuine concerns about the spread of fake news have intensified. The perceived ability of LLMs to produce convincing fake news at scale poses new challenges for both human and automated fake news detection systems. To address this gap, this paper presents the findings from a university-level competition that aimed to explore how LLMs can be used by humans to create fake news, and to assess the ability of human annotators and AI models to detect it. A total of 110 participants used LLMs to create 252 unique fake news stories, and 84 annotators participated in the detection tasks. Our findings indicate that LLMs are ~68% more effective at detecting real news than humans. However, for fake news detection, the performance of LLMs and humans remains comparable (~60% accuracy). Additionally, we examine the impact of visual elements (e.g., pictures) in news on the accuracy of detecting fake news stories. Finally, we also examine various strategies used by fake news creators to enhance the credibility of their AI-generated content. This work highlights the increasing complexity of detecting AI-generated fake news, particularly in collaborative human-AI settings.</description>

      <title>InjecGuard: Benchmarking and Mitigating Over-defense in Prompt Injection Guardrail Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a critical threat to large language models (LLMs), enabling goal hijacking and data leakage. Prompt guard models, though effective in defense, suffer from over-defense -- falsely flagging benign inputs as malicious due to trigger word bias. To address this issue, we introduce NotInject, an evaluation dataset that systematically measures over-defense across various prompt guard models. NotInject contains 339 benign samples enriched with trigger words common in prompt injection attacks, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Our results show that state-of-the-art models suffer from over-defense issues, with accuracy dropping close to random guessing levels (60%). To mitigate this, we propose InjecGuard, a novel prompt guard model that incorporates a new training strategy, Mitigating Over-defense for Free (MOF), which significantly reduces the bias on trigger words. InjecGuard demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on diverse benchmarks including NotInject, surpassing the existing best model by 30.8%, offering a robust and open-source solution for detecting prompt injection attacks. The code and datasets are released at https://github.com/leolee99/InjecGuard.</description>

      <title>TODO: Enhancing LLM Alignment with Ternary Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human intent is critical for enhancing their performance across a variety of tasks. Standard alignment techniques, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), often rely on the binary Bradley-Terry (BT) model, which can struggle to capture the complexities of human preferences -- particularly in the presence of noisy or inconsistent labels and frequent ties. To address these limitations, we introduce the Tie-rank Oriented Bradley-Terry model (TOBT), an extension of the BT model that explicitly incorporates ties, enabling more nuanced preference representation. Building on this, we propose Tie-rank Oriented Direct Preference Optimization (TODO), a novel alignment algorithm that leverages TOBT's ternary ranking system to improve preference alignment. In evaluations on Mistral-7B and Llama 3-8B models, TODO consistently outperforms DPO in modeling preferences across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. Additional assessments using MT Bench and benchmarks such as Piqa, ARC-c, and MMLU further demonstrate TODO's superior alignment performance. Notably, TODO also shows strong results in binary preference alignment, highlighting its versatility and potential for broader integration into LLM alignment. The implementation details can be found in https://github.com/XXares/TODO.</description>

      <title>How Does A Text Preprocessing Pipeline Affect Ontology Syntactic Matching?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03962v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classic text preprocessing pipeline, comprising Tokenisation, Normalisation, Stop Words Removal, and Stemming/Lemmatisation, has been implemented in many systems for syntactic ontology matching (OM). However, the lack of standardisation in text preprocessing creates diversity in mapping results. In this paper we investigate the effect of the text preprocessing pipeline on syntactic OM in 8 Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks with 49 distinct alignments. We find that Phase 1 text preprocessing (Tokenisation and Normalisation) is more effective than Phase 2 text preprocessing (Stop Words Removal and Stemming/Lemmatisation). To repair the unwanted false mappings caused by Phase 2 text preprocessing, we propose a novel context-based pipeline repair approach that employs a post hoc check to find common words that cause false mappings. These words are stored in a reserved word set and applied in text preprocessing. The experimental results show that our approach improves the matching correctness and the overall matching performance. We then consider the broader integration of the classic text preprocessing pipeline with modern large language models (LLMs) for OM. We recommend that (1) the text preprocessing pipeline be injected via function calling into LLMs to avoid the tendency towards unstable true mappings produced by LLM prompting; or (2) LLMs be used to repair non-existent and counter-intuitive false mappings generated by the text preprocessing pipeline.</description>

      <title>Federated Incremental Named Entity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Named Entity Recognition (FNER) boosts model training within each local client by aggregating the model updates of decentralized local clients, without sharing their private data. However, existing FNER methods assume fixed entity types and local clients in advance, leading to their ineffectiveness in practical applications. In a more realistic scenario, local clients receive new entity types continuously, while new local clients collecting novel data may irregularly join the global FNER training. This challenging setup, referred to here as Federated Incremental NER, renders the global model suffering from heterogeneous forgetting of old entity types from both intra-client and inter-client perspectives. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Local-Global Forgetting Defense (LGFD) model. Specifically, to address intra-client forgetting, we develop a structural knowledge distillation loss to retain the latent space's feature structure and a pseudo-label-guided inter-type contrastive loss to enhance discriminative capability over different entity types, effectively preserving previously learned knowledge within local clients. To tackle inter-client forgetting, we propose a task switching monitor that can automatically identify new entity types under privacy protection and store the latest old global model for knowledge distillation and pseudo-labeling. Experiments demonstrate significant improvement of our LGFD model over comparison methods.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Fine-Tuning on Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models have emerged as powerful tools for general intelligence, showcasing advanced natural language processing capabilities that find applications across diverse domains. Despite their impressive performance, recent studies have highlighted the potential for significant enhancements in LLMs' task-specific performance through fine-tuning strategies like Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and Quantized Low-Rank Adapters (Q-LoRA) method. However, previous works have shown that while fine-tuning offers significant performance gains, it also leads to challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and privacy and safety risks. To this end, there has been little to no work in \textit{understanding the impact of fine-tuning on the reasoning capabilities of LLMs}. Our research investigates the effect of fine-tuning on the reasoning abilities of LLMs, addressing critical questions regarding the impact of task-specific fine-tuning on overall reasoning capabilities, the influence of fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning performance, and the implications for the faithfulness of CoT reasonings. By exploring these dimensions, our study shows the impact of fine-tuning on LLM reasoning capabilities, where the faithfulness of CoT reasoning, on average across four datasets, decreases, highlighting potential shifts in internal mechanisms of the LLMs resulting from fine-tuning processes.</description>

      <title>Is Training Data Quality or Quantity More Impactful to Small Language Model Performance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the relative impact of training data quality versus quantity on the performance of small language models (SLMs), utilizing the TinyStories dataset for empirical analysis. Analysis of dataset variations with respect to size (25% and 50% of the original size) and duplication (controlled rates of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) were performed. Model performance was evaluated based on the validation loss, accuracy, and perplexity metrics. Results indicate training data quality plays a more significant role in the overall performance of SLMs, especially given scale of this experiment. Minimal duplication positively impacted model accuracy (+0.87% increase in accuracy at 25% duplication) without significantly increasing perplexity (+0.52% increase going from 0% to 25% duplication) but excessive duplication led to pronounced performance degradation (-40% drop in accuracy at 100% duplication). The implications of this exploration extend beyond just model performance; training large-scale models imposes significant financial and computational burdens, which can be prohibitive for organizations, individuals, and the public at large, especially in developing countries. Additionally, the energy consumption associated with large-scale training raises environmental concerns. Understanding the relative importance of data quality versus quantity could democratize AI technology, making advanced models more accessible and sustainable for all.</description>

      <title>Truth or Mirage? Towards End-to-End Factuality Evaluation with LLM-Oasis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been substantial improvements in the performance of Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, including Text Summarization and Machine Translation. However, LLMs still produce outputs containing hallucinations, that is, content not grounded in factual information. Therefore, developing methods to assess the factuality of LLMs has become urgent.
  Indeed, resources for factuality evaluation have recently emerged. Although challenging, these resources face one or more of the following limitations: (i) they are tailored to a specific task or domain; (ii) they are limited in size, thereby preventing the training of new factuality evaluators; (iii) they are designed for simpler verification tasks, such as claim verification.
  To address these issues, we introduce LLM-Oasis, to the best of our knowledge the largest resource for training end-to-end factuality evaluators. LLM-Oasis is constructed by extracting claims from Wikipedia, falsifying a subset of these claims, and generating pairs of factual and unfactual texts. We then rely on human annotators to both validate the quality of our dataset and to create a gold standard test set for benchmarking factuality evaluation systems.
  Our experiments demonstrate that LLM-Oasis presents a significant challenge for state-of-the-art LLMs, with GPT-4o achieving up to 60% accuracy in our proposed end-to-end factuality evaluation task, highlighting its potential to drive future research in the field.</description>

      <title>VisOnlyQA: Large Vision Language Models Still Struggle with Visual Perception of Geometric Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in various vision-language tasks. However, it is still unclear how accurately LVLMs can perceive visual information in images. In particular, the capability of LVLMs to perceive geometric information, such as shape, angle, and size, remains insufficiently analyzed, although the perception of these properties is crucial for tasks that require a detailed visual understanding. In this work, we introduce VisOnlyQA, a dataset for evaluating the geometric perception of LVLMs, and reveal that LVLMs often cannot accurately perceive basic geometric information in images, while human performance is nearly perfect. VisOnlyQA consists of 12 tasks that directly ask about geometric information in geometric shapes, charts, chemical structures, and 3D shapes. Our experiments highlight the following findings: (i) State-of-the-art LVLMs struggle with basic geometric perception -- 20 LVLMs we evaluate, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, work poorly on VisOnlyQA. (ii) Additional training data does not resolve this issue -- fine-tuning on the training set of VisOnlyQA is not always effective, even for in-distribution tasks. (iii) Bottleneck in the architecture -- LVLMs using stronger LLMs exhibit better geometric perception on VisOnlyQA, while it does not require complex reasoning, suggesting that the way LVLMs process information from visual encoders is a bottleneck. The datasets, code, and model responses are provided at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/VisOnlyQA.</description>

      <title>A Top-down Graph-based Tool for Modeling Classical Semantic Maps: A Crosslinguistic Case Study of Supplementary Adverbs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic map models (SMMs) construct a network-like conceptual space from cross-linguistic instances or forms, based on the connectivity hypothesis. This approach has been widely used to represent similarity and entailment relationships in cross-linguistic concept comparisons. However, most SMMs are manually built by human experts using bottom-up procedures, which are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based algorithm that automatically generates conceptual spaces and SMMs in a top-down manner. The algorithm begins by creating a dense graph, which is subsequently pruned into maximum spanning trees, selected according to metrics we propose. These evaluation metrics include both intrinsic and extrinsic measures, considering factors such as network structure and the trade-off between precision and coverage. A case study on cross-linguistic supplementary adverbs demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our model compared to human annotations and other automated methods.

      <title>EmoVerse: Exploring Multimodal Large Language Models for Sentiment and Emotion Understanding</title>

Abstract: Sentiment and emotion understanding are essential to applications such as human-computer interaction and depression detection. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate robust general capabilities, they face considerable challenges in the field of affective computing, particularly in detecting subtle facial expressions and handling complex emotion-related tasks, such as emotion reason inference and understanding emotions in long-context scenarios. Furthermore, there is a lack of a unified MLLM that can effectively handle both sentiment and emotion-related tasks. To address these challenges, we explore multi-task training strategies for MLLMs in affective computing and introduce Emotion Universe (EmoVerse), an MLLM designed to handle a broad spectrum of sentiment and emotion-related tasks. In addition, EmoVerse is capable of deeply analyzing the underlying causes of emotional states. We also introduce the Affective Multitask (AMT) Dataset, which supports multimodal sentiment analysis, multimodal emotion recognition, facial expression recognition, emotion reason inference, and emotion cause-pair extraction tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EmoVerse outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in sentiment and emotion-related tasks.

      <title>Evil twins are not that evil: Qualitative insights into machine-generated prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been widely observed that language models (LMs) respond in predictable ways to algorithmically generated prompts that are seemingly unintelligible. This is both a sign that we lack a full understanding of how LMs work, and a practical challenge, because opaqueness can be exploited for harmful uses of LMs, such as jailbreaking. We present the first thorough analysis of opaque machine-generated prompts, or autoprompts, pertaining to 6 LMs of different sizes and families. We find that machine-generated prompts are characterized by a last token that is often intelligible and strongly affects the generation. A small but consistent proportion of the previous tokens are prunable, probably appearing in the prompt as a by-product of the fact that the optimization process fixes the number of tokens. The remaining tokens fall into two categories: filler tokens, which can be replaced with semantically unrelated substitutes, and keywords, that tend to have at least a loose semantic relation with the generation, although they do not engage in well-formed syntactic relations with it. Additionally, human experts can reliably identify the most influential tokens in an autoprompt a posteriori, suggesting these prompts are not entirely opaque. Finally, some of the ablations we applied to autoprompts yield similar effects in natural language inputs, suggesting that autoprompts emerge naturally from the way LMs process linguistic inputs in general.</description>

      <title>MedHallBench: A New Benchmark for Assessing Hallucination in Medical Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated potential in healthcare applications, yet their propensity for hallucinations -- generating medically implausible or inaccurate information -- presents substantial risks to patient care. This paper introduces MedHallBench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs. Our methodology integrates expert-validated medical case scenarios with established medical databases to create a robust evaluation dataset. The framework employs a sophisticated measurement system that combines automated ACHMI (Automatic Caption Hallucination Measurement in Medical Imaging) scoring with rigorous clinical expert evaluations and utilizes reinforcement learning methods to achieve automatic annotation. Through an optimized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) training pipeline specifically designed for medical applications, MedHallBench enables thorough evaluation of MLLMs across diverse clinical contexts while maintaining stringent accuracy standards. We conducted comparative experiments involving various models, utilizing the benchmark to establish a baseline for widely adopted large language models (LLMs). Our findings indicate that ACHMI provides a more nuanced understanding of the effects of hallucinations compared to traditional metrics, thereby highlighting its advantages in hallucination assessment. This research establishes a foundational framework for enhancing MLLMs' reliability in healthcare settings and presents actionable strategies for addressing the critical challenge of AI hallucinations in medical applications.</description>

      <title>The interplay between domain specialization and model size</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling laws for language models have often focused on finding the optimal model size and token count for training from scratch. However, achieving this optimal balance requires significant compute resources due to the extensive data demands when training models from randomly-initialized weights. Continued pretraining offers a cost-effective alternative, leveraging the compute investment from pretrained models to incorporate new knowledge without requiring extensive new data. Recent findings suggest that data quality influences constants in scaling laws, thereby altering the optimal parameter-token allocation ratio. Building on this insight, we investigate the interplay between domain specialization and model size during continued pretraining under compute-constrained scenarios. Our goal is to identify an optimal training regime for this scenario and detect patterns in this interplay that can be generalized across different model sizes and domains. To compare general and specialized training, we filtered a web-based dataset to extract data from three domains: legal, medical, and accounting. We pretrained models with 1.5B, 3B, 7B, and 14B parameters on both the unfiltered and filtered datasets, then evaluated their performance on domain-specific exams. Results show that as model size increases, specialized models outperform general models while requiring less training compute. Additionally, their growing compute efficiency leads to reduced forgetting of previously learned knowledge.</description>

      <title>Merging Feed-Forward Sublayers for Compressed Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise and ubiquity of larger deep learning models, the need for high-quality compression techniques is growing in order to deploy these models widely. The sheer parameter count of these models makes it difficult to fit them into the memory constraints of different hardware. In this work, we present a novel approach to model compression by merging similar parameter groups within a model, rather than pruning away less important parameters. Specifically, we select, align, and merge separate feed-forward sublayers in Transformer models, and test our method on language modeling, image classification, and machine translation. With our method, we demonstrate performance comparable to the original models while combining more than a third of model feed-forward sublayers, and demonstrate improved performance over a strong layer-pruning baseline. For instance, we can remove over 21% of total parameters from a Vision Transformer, while maintaining 99% of its original performance. Additionally, we observe that some groups of feed-forward sublayers exhibit high activation similarity, which may help explain their surprising mergeability.</description>

      <title>Critique Fine-Tuning: Learning to Critique is More Effective than Learning to Imitate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17703v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is commonly used to train language models to imitate annotated responses for given instructions. In this paper, we propose Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT), a method more effective than SFT for reasoning tasks. Instead of simply imitating correct responses, CFT trains models to critique noisy responses, inspired by human learning processes that emphasize critical thinking, deeper analysis, and nuanced understanding - traits often overlooked by standard SFT. To validate the effectiveness of CFT, we construct multiple critique datasets (e.g., WebInstruct, MetaMath, NuminaMath), where GPT-4o serves as the teacher to generate critiques in the form of ([query; noisy response], critique). Experiments on these datasets demonstrate that CFT consistently outperforms SFT by 4-10% across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks, and is effective across different base models including Qwen2.5, Qwen2.5-Math, and DeepSeek-Math. Notably, our model Qwen2.5-Math-CFT only requires 1 hour of training on 8 x H100 over the 50K examples, yet matches or outperforms strong competitors like Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct on most benchmarks, which use over 2M samples. Moreover, it matches the performance of SimpleRL, which is a DeepSeek-r1 replication trained with 140 x more compute. Experiments on IF_Eval and MT-Bench further demonstrate that CFT can significantly enhance the model's general generation and instruction-following capabilities, outperforming the Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct by a large margin. Ablation studies show that CFT is robust to noisy response sources and teacher critique models. These findings highlight that CFT offers a more effective alternative to advance the reasoning of language models.</description>

      <title>Estimating LLM Uncertainty with Logits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past few years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed rapidly and are widely applied in various domains. However, LLMs face the issue of hallucinations, generating responses that may be unreliable when the models lack relevant knowledge. To be aware of potential hallucinations, uncertainty estimation methods have been introduced, and most of them have confirmed that reliability lies in critical tokens. However, probability-based methods perform poorly in identifying token reliability, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we reveal that the probability-based method fails to estimate token reliability due to the loss of evidence strength information which is accumulated in the training stage. Therefore, we present Logits-induced token uncertainty (LogTokU), a framework for estimating decoupled token uncertainty in LLMs, enabling real-time uncertainty estimation without requiring multiple sampling processes. We employ evidence modeling to implement LogTokU and use the estimated uncertainty to guide downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that LogTokU has significant effectiveness and promise.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodological framework for detecting and classifying latent constructs, including frames, narratives, and topics, from textual data using Open-Source Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed hybrid approach combines automated summarization with human-in-the-loop validation to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of construct identification. By employing iterative sampling coupled with expert refinement, the framework guarantees methodological robustness and ensures conceptual precision. Applied to diverse data sets, including AI policy debates, newspaper articles on encryption, and the 20 Newsgroups data set, this approach demonstrates its versatility in systematically analyzing complex political discourses, media framing, and topic classification tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of multilingual large language models (LLMs) highlights the need for high-quality, diverse, and clean multilingual datasets. In this paper, we introduce DCAD-2000 (Data Cleaning as Anomaly Detection), a large-scale multilingual corpus built using newly extracted Common Crawl data and existing multilingual datasets. DCAD-2000 includes over 2,282 languages, 46.72TB of data, and 8.63 billion documents, spanning 155 high- and medium-resource languages and 159 writing scripts. To overcome the limitations of current data cleaning methods, which rely on manual heuristic thresholds, we propose reframing data cleaning as an anomaly detection task. This dynamic filtering approach significantly enhances data quality by identifying and removing noisy or anomalous content. We evaluate the quality of DCAD-2000 on the FineTask benchmark, demonstrating substantial improvements in multilingual dataset quality and task performance.</description>

      <title>Machine-generated text detection prevents language model collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their generated outputs are proliferating across the web, risking a future where machine-generated content dilutes human-authored text. Since online data is the primary resource for LLM pre-training, subsequent models could be trained on an unknown portion of synthetic samples. This will lead to model collapse, a degenerative process whereby LLMs reinforce their own errors, and ultimately yield a declining performance. In this study, we investigate the impact of decoding strategy on model collapse, analysing the characteristics of text at each model generation, the similarity to human references, and the resulting model performance. Using the decoding strategies that lead to the most significant degradation, we evaluate model collapse in more realistic scenarios where the origin of the data (human or synthetic) is unknown. We train a machine-generated text detector and propose an importance sampling approach to alleviate model collapse. Our method is validated on two LLM variants (GPT-2 and SmolLM2) on the open-ended text generation task. We demonstrate that it can not only prevent model collapse but also improve performance when sufficient human-authored samples are present.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Detect Errors in Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, o1-like models have drawn significant attention, where these models produce the long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning steps to improve the reasoning abilities of existing Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, to understand the qualities of these long CoTs and measure the critique abilities of existing LLMs on these long CoTs, we introduce the DeltaBench, including the generated long CoTs from different o1-like models (e.g., QwQ, DeepSeek-R1) for different reasoning tasks (e.g., Math, Code, General Reasoning), to measure the ability to detect errors in long CoT reasoning. Based on DeltaBench, we first perform fine-grained analysis of the generated long CoTs to discover the effectiveness and efficiency of different o1-like models. Then, we conduct extensive evaluations of existing process reward models (PRMs) and critic models to detect the errors of each annotated process, which aims to investigate the boundaries and limitations of existing PRMs and critic models. Finally, we hope that DeltaBench could guide developers to better understand the long CoT reasoning abilities of their models.</description>

Abstract: We release 70,509 high-quality social networks extracted from multilingual fiction and nonfiction narratives. We additionally provide metadata for $\sim$30,000 of these texts (73\% nonfiction and 27\% fiction) written between 1800 and 1999 in 58 languages. This dataset provides information on historical social worlds at an unprecedented scale, including data for 2,510,021 individuals in 2,805,482 pair-wise relationships annotated for affinity and relationship type. We achieve this scale by automating previously manual methods of extracting social networks; specifically, we adapt an existing annotation task as a language model prompt, ensuring consistency at scale with the use of structured output. This dataset serves as a unique resource for humanities and social science research by providing data on cognitive models of social realities.</description>

      <title>Triple Phase Transitions: Understanding the Learning Dynamics of Large Language Models from a Neuroscience Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit abrupt emergent behavior, whereby new abilities arise at certain points during their training. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as a ''phase transition'', remains poorly understood. In this study, we conduct an integrative analysis of such phase transitions by examining three interconnected perspectives: the similarity between LLMs and the human brain, the internal states of LLMs, and downstream task performance. We propose a novel interpretation for the learning dynamics of LLMs that vary in both training data and architecture, revealing that three phase transitions commonly emerge across these models during training: (1) alignment with the entire brain surges as LLMs begin adhering to task instructions Brain Alignment and Instruction Following, (2) unexpectedly, LLMs diverge from the brain during a period in which downstream task accuracy temporarily stagnates Brain Detachment and Stagnation, and (3) alignment with the brain reoccurs as LLMs become capable of solving the downstream tasks Brain Realignment and Consolidation. These findings illuminate the underlying mechanisms of phase transitions in LLMs, while opening new avenues for interdisciplinary research bridging AI and neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Semantic Volume: Quantifying and Detecting both External and Internal Uncertainty in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks by encoding vast amounts of factual knowledge. However, they are still prone to hallucinations, generating incorrect or misleading information, often accompanied by high uncertainty. Existing methods for hallucination detection primarily focus on quantifying internal uncertainty, which arises from missing or conflicting knowledge within the model. However, hallucinations can also stem from external uncertainty, where ambiguous user queries lead to multiple possible interpretations. In this work, we introduce Semantic Volume, a novel mathematical measure for quantifying both external and internal uncertainty in LLMs. Our approach perturbs queries and responses, embeds them in a semantic space, and computes the determinant of the Gram matrix of the embedding vectors, capturing their dispersion as a measure of uncertainty. Our framework provides a generalizable and unsupervised uncertainty detection method without requiring internal access to LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on both external and internal uncertainty detection, demonstrating that our Semantic Volume method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both tasks. Additionally, we provide theoretical insights linking our measure to differential entropy, unifying and extending previous sampling-based uncertainty measures such as the semantic entropy. Semantic Volume is shown to be a robust and interpretable approach to improving the reliability of LLMs by systematically detecting uncertainty in both user queries and model responses.</description>

      <title>Automatic Speech Recognition for Non-Native English: Accuracy and Disfluency Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been an essential component of computer assisted language learning (CALL) and computer assisted language testing (CALT) for many years. As this technology continues to develop rapidly, it is important to evaluate the accuracy of current ASR systems for language learning applications. This study assesses five cutting-edge ASR systems' recognition of non-native accented English speech using recordings from the L2-ARCTIC corpus, featuring speakers from six different L1 backgrounds (Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, Korean, Spanish, and Vietnamese), in the form of both read and spontaneous speech. The read speech consisted of 2,400 single sentence recordings from 24 speakers, while the spontaneous speech included narrative recordings from 22 speakers. Results showed that for read speech, Whisper and AssemblyAI achieved the best accuracy with mean Match Error Rates (MER) of 0.054 and 0.056 respectively, approaching human-level accuracy. For spontaneous speech, RevAI performed best with a mean MER of 0.063. The study also examined how each system handled disfluencies such as filler words, repetitions, and revisions, finding significant variation in performance across systems and disfluency types. While processing speed varied considerably between systems, longer processing times did not necessarily correlate with better accuracy. By detailing the performance of several of the most recent, widely-available ASR systems on non-native English speech, this study aims to help language instructors and researchers understand the strengths and weaknesses of each system and identify which may be suitable for specific use cases.</description>

      <title>X-EcoMLA: Upcycling Pre-Trained Attention into MLA for Efficient and Extreme KV Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-head latent attention (MLA) is designed to optimize KV cache memory through low-rank key-value joint compression. Rather than caching keys and values separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing memory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory efficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation lies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be trained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits fully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different attention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post training distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention into an efficient hybrid MLA variant through lightweight post-training adaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training. We demonstrate that leveraging the dark knowledge of a well-trained model can enhance training accuracy and enable extreme KV cache compression in MLA without compromising model performance. The experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively compress the KV cache while preserving the performance on the benchmarks; specifically, for Llama3.2-1B-Instruct baseline, a 6.4x compression achieves the same average score by using only 3.6B training tokens and 70 GPU hours on AMD MI300, whereas a 10.6x compression have less than 0.1\% average score drop with 7B training tokens and 140 GPU hours.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating text, images, and video content. However, as context length grows, the computational cost of attention increases quadratically with the number of tokens, presenting significant efficiency challenges. This paper presents an analysis of various Key-Value (KV) cache compression strategies, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes these methods by their underlying principles and implementation techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate their impact on performance and inference latency, providing critical insights into their effectiveness. Our findings highlight the trade-offs involved in KV cache compression and its influence on handling long-context scenarios, paving the way for more efficient LLM implementations.</description>

      <title>TablePilot: Recommending Human-Preferred Tabular Data Analysis with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13262v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tabular data analysis is crucial in many scenarios, yet efficiently identifying the most relevant data analysis queries and results for a new table remains a significant challenge. The complexity of tabular data, diverse analytical operations, and the demand for high-quality analysis make the process tedious. To address these challenges, we aim to recommend query-code-result triplets tailored for new tables in tabular data analysis workflows. In this paper, we present TablePilot, a pioneering tabular data analysis framework leveraging large language models to autonomously generate comprehensive and superior analytical results without relying on user profiles or prior interactions. The framework incorporates key designs in analysis preparation and analysis optimization to enhance accuracy. Additionally, we propose Rec-Align, a novel method to further improve recommendation quality and better align with human preferences. Experiments on DART, a dataset specifically designed for comprehensive tabular data analysis recommendation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Based on GPT-4o, the tuned TablePilot achieves 77.0% top-5 recommendation recall. Human evaluations further highlight its effectiveness in optimizing tabular data analysis workflows.</description>

      <title>Self-Vocabularizing Training for Neural Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Past vocabulary learning techniques identify relevant vocabulary before training, relying on statistical and entropy-based assumptions that largely neglect the role of model training. Empirically, we observe that trained translation models are induced to use a byte-pair encoding (BPE) vocabulary subset distinct from the original BPE vocabulary, leading to performance improvements when retrained with the induced vocabulary. In this paper, we analyze this discrepancy in neural machine translation by examining vocabulary and entropy shifts during self-training--where each iteration generates a labeled dataset by pairing source sentences with the model's predictions to define a new vocabulary. Building on these insights, we propose self-vocabularizing training, an iterative method that self-selects a smaller, more optimal vocabulary, yielding up to a 1.49 BLEU improvement. Moreover, we find that deeper model architectures lead to both an increase in unique token usage and a 6-8% reduction in vocabulary size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present RWKV-7 "Goose", a new sequence modeling architecture with constant memory usage and constant inference time per token. Despite being trained on dramatically fewer tokens than other top models, our 2.9 billion parameter language model achieves a new 3B SoTA on multilingual tasks and matches the current 3B SoTA on English language downstream performance. RWKV-7 introduces a newly generalized formulation of the delta rule with vector-valued gating and in-context learning rates, as well as a relaxed value replacement rule. We show that RWKV-7 can perform state tracking and recognize all regular languages, while retaining parallelizability of training. This exceeds the capabilities of Transformers under standard complexity conjectures, which are limited to $\mathsf{TC}^0$. To demonstrate RWKV-7's language modeling capability, we also present an extended open source 3.1 trillion token multilingual corpus, and train four RWKV-7 models ranging from 0.19 billion to 2.9 billion parameters on this dataset.
  To foster openness, reproduction, and adoption, we release our models and dataset component listing at https://huggingface.co/RWKV, and our training and inference code at https://github.com/RWKV/RWKV-LM all under the Apache 2.0 License.</description>

      <title>Surgical Action Planning with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, we introduce the Surgical Action Planning (SAP) task, which generates future action plans from visual inputs to address the absence of intraoperative predictive planning in current intelligent applications. SAP shows great potential for enhancing intraoperative guidance and automating procedures. However, it faces challenges such as understanding instrument-action relationships and tracking surgical progress. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in understanding surgical video content but remain underexplored for predictive decision-making in SAP, as they focus mainly on retrospective analysis. Challenges like data privacy, computational demands, and modality-specific constraints further highlight significant research gaps. To tackle these challenges, we introduce LLM-SAP, a Large Language Models-based Surgical Action Planning framework that predicts future actions and generates text responses by interpreting natural language prompts of surgical goals. The text responses potentially support surgical education, intraoperative decision-making, procedure documentation, and skill analysis. LLM-SAP integrates two novel modules: the Near-History Focus Memory Module (NHF-MM) for modeling historical states and the prompts factory for action planning. We evaluate LLM-SAP on our constructed CholecT50-SAP dataset using models like Qwen2.5 and Qwen2-VL, demonstrating its effectiveness in next-action prediction. Pre-trained LLMs are tested in a zero-shot setting, and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with LoRA is implemented. Our experiments show that Qwen2.5-72B-SFT surpasses Qwen2.5-72B with a 19.3% higher accuracy.</description>

      <title>EQ-Negotiator: An Emotion-Reasoning LLM Agent in Credit Dialogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21080v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While large language model (LLM)-based chatbots have been applied for effective engagement in credit dialogues, their capacity for dynamic emotional expression remains limited. Current agents primarily rely on passive empathy rather than affective reasoning. For instance, when faced with persistent client negativity, the agent should employ strategic emotional adaptation by expressing measured anger to discourage counterproductive behavior and guide the conversation toward resolution. This context-aware emotional modulation is essential for imitating the nuanced decision-making of human negotiators. This paper introduces an EQ-negotiator that combines emotion sensing from pre-trained language models (PLMs) with emotional reasoning based on Game Theory and Hidden Markov Models. It takes into account both the current and historical emotions of the client to better manage and address negative emotions during interactions. By fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) on public emotion datasets and validating them on the credit dialogue datasets, our approach enables LLM-based agents to effectively capture shifts in client emotions and dynamically adjust their response tone based on our emotion decision policies in real-world financial negotiations. This EQ-negotiator can also help credit agencies foster positive client relationships, enhancing satisfaction in credit services.</description>

      <title>JiraiBench: A Bilingual Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models' Detection of Human Self-Destructive Behavior Content in Jirai Community</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces JiraiBench, the first bilingual benchmark for evaluating large language models' effectiveness in detecting self-destructive content across Chinese and Japanese social media communities. Focusing on the transnational "Jirai" (landmine) online subculture that encompasses multiple forms of self-destructive behaviors including drug overdose, eating disorders, and self-harm, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework incorporating both linguistic and cultural dimensions. Our dataset comprises 10,419 Chinese posts and 5,000 Japanese posts with multidimensional annotation along three behavioral categories, achieving substantial inter-annotator agreement. Experimental evaluations across four state-of-the-art models reveal significant performance variations based on instructional language, with Japanese prompts unexpectedly outperforming Chinese prompts when processing Chinese content. This emergent cross-cultural transfer suggests that cultural proximity can sometimes outweigh linguistic similarity in detection tasks. Cross-lingual transfer experiments with fine-tuned models further demonstrate the potential for knowledge transfer between these language systems without explicit target language training. These findings highlight the need for culturally-informed approaches to multilingual content moderation and provide empirical evidence for the importance of cultural context in developing more effective detection systems for vulnerable online communities.</description>

      <title>Effective Skill Unlearning through Intervention and Abstention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable skills across various domains. Understanding the mechanisms behind their abilities and implementing controls over them is becoming increasingly important for developing better models. In this paper, we focus on skill unlearning in LLMs, specifically unlearning a particular skill while retaining their overall capabilities. We introduce two lightweight, training-free machine skill unlearning techniques for LLMs. First, we observe that the pre-activation distribution of neurons in each Feed-Forward Layer (FFL) differs when the model demonstrates different skills. Additionally, we find that queries triggering the same skill cluster within the FFL key space and can be separated from other queries using a hypercube. Based on these observations, we propose two lightweight, training-free skill unlearning methods via \textit{intervention} and \textit{abstention} respectively: \texttt{Neuron Adjust} and \texttt{Key Space Detection}. We evaluate our methods on unlearning math-solving, Python-coding, and comprehension skills across seven different languages. The results demonstrate their strong unlearning capabilities for the designated skills. Specifically, \texttt{Key Space Detection} achieves over 80\% relative performance drop on the forgetting skill and less than 10\% relative performance drop on other skills and the model's general knowledge (MMLU) for most unlearning tasks.

      <title>Transfer-learning for video classification: Video Swin Transformer on multiple domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computer vision community has seen a shift from convolutional-based to pure transformer architectures for both image and video tasks. Training a transformer from zero for these tasks usually requires a lot of data and computational resources. Video Swin Transformer (VST) is a pure-transformer model developed for video classification which achieves state-of-the-art results in accuracy and efficiency on several datasets. In this paper, we aim to understand if VST generalizes well enough to be used in an out-of-domain setting. We study the performance of VST on two large-scale datasets, namely FCVID and Something-Something using a transfer learning approach from Kinetics-400, which requires around 4x less memory than training from scratch. We then break down the results to understand where VST fails the most and in which scenarios the transfer-learning approach is viable. Our experiments show an 85\% top-1 accuracy on FCVID without retraining the whole model which is equal to the state-of-the-art for the dataset and a 21\% accuracy on Something-Something. The experiments also suggest that the performance of the VST decreases on average when the video duration increases which seems to be a consequence of a design choice of the model. From the results, we conclude that VST generalizes well enough to classify out-of-domain videos without retraining when the target classes are from the same type as the classes used to train the model. We observed this effect when we performed transfer-learning from Kinetics-400 to FCVID, where most datasets target mostly objects. On the other hand, if the classes are not from the same type, then the accuracy after the transfer-learning approach is expected to be poor. We observed this effect when we performed transfer-learning from Kinetics-400, where the classes represent mostly objects, to Something-Something, where the classes represent mostly actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language tasks, such as VQA, SNLI-VE, and VCR are challenging because they require the model's reasoning ability to understand the semantics of the visual world and natural language. Supervised methods working for vision-language tasks have been well-studied. However, solving these tasks in a zero-shot setting is less explored. Since Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has shown remarkable zero-shot performance on image-text matching, previous works utilized its strong zero-shot ability by converting vision-language tasks into an image-text matching problem, and they mainly consider global-level matching (e.g., the whole image or sentence). However, we find visual and textual fine-grained information, e.g., keywords in the sentence and objects in the image, can be fairly informative for semantics understanding. Inspired by this, we propose a unified framework to take advantage of the fine-grained information for zero-shot vision-language learning, covering multiple tasks such as VQA, SNLI-VE, and VCR. Our experiments show that our framework outperforms former zero-shot methods on VQA and achieves substantial improvement on SNLI-VE and VCR. Furthermore, our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we enhance the node features acquired from Pretrained Models (PMs) to better suit downstream graph learning tasks? Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art approach for many high-impact, real-world graph applications. For feature-rich graphs, a prevalent practice involves utilizing a PM directly to generate features, without incorporating any domain adaptation techniques. Nevertheless, this practice is suboptimal because the node features extracted from PM are graph-agnostic and prevent GNNs from fully utilizing the potential correlations between the graph structure and node features, leading to a decline in GNNs performance. In this work, we seek to improve the node features obtained from a PM for downstream graph tasks and introduce TOUCHUP-G, which has several advantages. It is (a) General: applicable to any downstream graph task, including link prediction which is often employed in recommender systems; (b) Multi-modal: able to improve raw features of any modality (e.g. images, texts, audio); (c) Principled: it is closely related to a novel metric, feature homophily, which we propose to quantify the potential correlations between the graph structure and node features and we show that TOUCHUP-G can effectively shrink the discrepancy between the graph structure and node features; (d) Effective: achieving state-of-the-art results on four real-world datasets spanning different tasks and modalities.</description>

      <title>Computer Vision Datasets and Models Exhibit Cultural and Linguistic Diversity in Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14356v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computer vision often treats human perception as homogeneous: an implicit assumption that visual stimuli are perceived similarly by everyone. This assumption is reflected in the way researchers collect datasets and train vision models. By contrast, literature in cross-cultural psychology and linguistics has provided evidence that people from different cultural backgrounds observe vastly different concepts even when viewing the same visual stimuli. In this paper, we study how these differences manifest themselves in vision-language datasets and models, using language as a proxy for culture. By comparing textual descriptions generated across 7 languages for the same images, we find significant differences in the semantic content and linguistic expression. When datasets are multilingual as opposed to monolingual, descriptions have higher semantic coverage on average, where coverage is measured using scene graphs, model embeddings, and linguistic taxonomies. For example, multilingual descriptions have on average 29.9% more objects, 24.5% more relations, and 46.0% more attributes than a set of monolingual captions. When prompted to describe images in different languages, popular models (e.g. LLaVA) inherit this bias and describe different parts of the image. Moreover, finetuning models on captions from one language performs best on corresponding test data from that language, while finetuning on multilingual data performs consistently well across all test data compositions. Our work points towards the need to account for and embrace the diversity of human perception in the computer vision community.</description>

      <title>Modeling Caption Diversity in Contrastive Vision-Language Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00740v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are a thousand ways to caption an image. Contrastive Language Pretraining (CLIP) on the other hand, works by mapping an image and its caption to a single vector -- limiting how well CLIP-like models can represent the diverse ways to describe an image. In this work, we introduce Llip, Latent Language Image Pretraining, which models the diversity of captions that could match an image. Llip's vision encoder outputs a set of visual features that are mixed into a final representation by conditioning on information derived from the text. We show that Llip outperforms non-contextualized baselines like CLIP and SigLIP on a variety of tasks even with large-scale encoders. Llip improves zero-shot classification by an average of 2.9% zero-shot classification benchmarks with a ViT-G/14 encoder. Specifically, Llip attains a zero-shot top-1 accuracy of 83.5% on ImageNet outperforming a similarly sized CLIP by 1.4%. We also demonstrate improvement on zero-shot retrieval on MS-COCO by 6.0%. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the components introduced by the method and demonstrate that Llip leads to richer visual representations.</description>

      <title>TimeCMA: Towards LLM-Empowered Multivariate Time Series Forecasting via Cross-Modality Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01638v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) aims to learn temporal dynamics among variables to forecast future time series. Existing statistical and deep learning-based methods suffer from limited learnable parameters and small-scale training data. Recently, large language models (LLMs) combining time series with textual prompts have achieved promising performance in MTSF. However, we discovered that current LLM-based solutions fall short in learning disentangled embeddings. We introduce TimeCMA, an intuitive yet effective framework for MTSF via cross-modality alignment. Specifically, we present a dual-modality encoding with two branches: the time series encoding branch extracts disentangled yet weak time series embeddings, and the LLM-empowered encoding branch wraps the same time series with text as prompts to obtain entangled yet robust prompt embeddings. As a result, such a cross-modality alignment retrieves both disentangled and robust time series embeddings, "the best of two worlds", from the prompt embeddings based on time series and prompt modality similarities. As another key design, to reduce the computational costs from time series with their length textual prompts, we design an effective prompt to encourage the most essential temporal information to be encapsulated in the last token: only the last token is passed to downstream prediction. We further store the last token embeddings to accelerate inference speed. Extensive experiments on eight real datasets demonstrate that TimeCMA outperforms state-of-the-arts.</description>

      <title>Blind Baselines Beat Membership Inference Attacks for Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membership inference (MI) attacks try to determine if a data sample was used to train a machine learning model. For foundation models trained on unknown Web data, MI attacks are often used to detect copyrighted training materials, measure test set contamination, or audit machine unlearning. Unfortunately, we find that evaluations of MI attacks for foundation models are flawed, because they sample members and non-members from different distributions. For 8 published MI evaluation datasets, we show that blind attacks -- that distinguish the member and non-member distributions without looking at any trained model -- outperform state-of-the-art MI attacks. Existing evaluations thus tell us nothing about membership leakage of a foundation model's training data.</description>

      <title>MAQA: Evaluating Uncertainty Quantification in LLMs Regarding Data Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the massive advancements in large language models (LLMs), they still suffer from producing plausible but incorrect responses. To improve the reliability of LLMs, recent research has focused on uncertainty quantification to predict whether a response is correct or not. However, most uncertainty quantification methods have been evaluated on single-labeled questions, which removes data uncertainty: the irreducible randomness often present in user queries, which can arise from factors like multiple possible answers. This limitation may cause uncertainty quantification results to be unreliable in practical settings. In this paper, we investigate previous uncertainty quantification methods under the presence of data uncertainty. Our contributions are two-fold: 1) proposing a new Multi-Answer Question Answering dataset, MAQA, consisting of world knowledge, mathematical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning tasks to evaluate uncertainty quantification regarding data uncertainty, and 2) assessing 5 uncertainty quantification methods of diverse white- and black-box LLMs. Our findings show that previous methods relatively struggle compared to single-answer settings, though this varies depending on the task. Moreover, we observe that entropy- and consistency-based methods effectively estimate model uncertainty, even in the presence of data uncertainty. We believe these observations will guide future work on uncertainty quantification in more realistic settings.</description>

      <title>On the Implicit Relation Between Low-Rank Adaptation and Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17538v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant approach in natural language processing involves large-scale pre-training of models on general domain data followed by their adaptation to specific tasks or domains. As models grow in size, full fine-tuning all of their parameters becomes increasingly impractical. To address this, some methods for low-rank task adaptation of language models have been proposed, e.g., LoRA and FLoRA. These methods keep the pre-trained model weights fixed and incorporate trainable low-rank decomposition matrices into some layers of the transformer architecture, called adapters. This approach significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters required for downstream tasks compared to full fine-tuning all parameters. In this work, we look at low-rank adaptation from the lens of data privacy. We show theoretically that the low-rank adaptation used in LoRA and FLoRA leads to the injection of some random noise into the batch gradients w.r.t the adapter parameters. We quantify the variance of the injected noise and show that the smaller the adaptation rank, the larger the noise variance. By establishing a Berry-Esseen type bound on the total variation distance between distribution of the injected noise and a Gaussian distribution with the same variance, we show that the dynamics of low-rank adaptation is close to that of differentially private fine-tuning of the adapters. Finally, using Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, we show that when augmented with gradient scaling, low-rank adaptation is very close to performing DPSGD algorithm with a fixed noise scale to fine-tune the adapters. Suggested by our theoretical findings and approved by our experimental results, we show that low-rank adaptation, besides mitigating the space and computational complexities, implicitly provides a privacy protection w.r.t the fine-tuning data, without inducing the high space complexity of DPSGD.</description>

      <title>MMIE: Massive Multimodal Interleaved Comprehension Benchmark for Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation, enabling models to produce and interpret both images and text in arbitrary sequences, have become a pivotal area in multimodal learning. Despite significant advancements, the evaluation of this capability remains insufficient. Existing benchmarks suffer from limitations in data scale, scope, and evaluation depth, while current evaluation metrics are often costly or biased, lacking in reliability for practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce MMIE, a large-scale knowledge-intensive benchmark for evaluating interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). MMIE comprises 20K meticulously curated multimodal queries, spanning 3 categories, 12 fields, and 102 subfields, including mathematics, coding, physics, literature, health, and arts. It supports both interleaved inputs and outputs, offering a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended question formats to evaluate diverse competencies. Moreover, we propose a reliable automated evaluation metric, leveraging a scoring model fine-tuned with human-annotated data and systematic evaluation criteria, aimed at reducing bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and metrics in providing a comprehensive evaluation of interleaved LVLMs. Specifically, we evaluate eight LVLMs, revealing that even the best models show significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results. We believe MMIE will drive further advancements in the development of interleaved LVLMs. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://mmie-bench.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Continuous Speech Tokenizer in Text To Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fusion of speech and language in the era of large language models has garnered significant attention. Discrete speech token is often utilized in text-to-speech tasks for speech compression and portability, which is convenient for joint training with text and have good compression efficiency. However, we found that the discrete speech tokenizer still suffers from information loss. Therefore, we propose a simple yet effective continuous speech tokenizer named Cont-SPT, and a text-to-speech model based on continuous speech tokens. Our results show that the speech language model based on the continuous speech tokenizer has better continuity and higher estimated Mean Opinion Scores (MoS). This enhancement is attributed to better information preservation rate of the continuous speech tokenizer across both low and high frequencies in the frequency domain. The code and resources for Cont-SPT can be found in https://github.com/Yixing-Li/Continuous-Speech-Tokenizer</description>

      <title>Data Extraction Attacks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Backdoors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements, large language models (LLMs) still struggle with providing accurate answers when lacking domain-specific or up-to-date knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external knowledge bases, but it also introduces new attack surfaces. In this paper, we investigate data extraction attacks targeting RAG's knowledge databases. We show that previous prompt injection-based extraction attacks largely rely on the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs. As a result, they fail on models that are less responsive to such malicious prompts -- for example, our experiments show that state-of-the-art attacks achieve near-zero success on Gemma-2B-IT. Moreover, even for models that can follow these instructions, we found fine-tuning may significantly reduce attack performance. To further reveal the vulnerability, we propose to backdoor RAG, where a small portion of poisoned data is injected during the fine-tuning phase to create a backdoor within the LLM. When this compromised LLM is integrated into a RAG system, attackers can exploit specific triggers in prompts to manipulate the LLM to leak documents from the retrieval database. By carefully designing the poisoned data, we achieve both verbatim and paraphrased document extraction. For example, on Gemma-2B-IT, we show that with only 5\% poisoned data, our method achieves an average success rate of 94.1\% for verbatim extraction (ROUGE-L score: 82.1) and 63.6\% for paraphrased extraction (average ROUGE score: 66.4) across four datasets. These results underscore the privacy risks associated with the supply chain when deploying RAG systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12118v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, I introduce the retrieval problem, a simple yet common reasoning task that can be solved only by transformers with a minimum number of layers, which grows logarithmically with the input size. I empirically show that large language models can solve the task under different prompting formulations without any fine-tuning. To understand how transformers solve the retrieval problem, I train several transformers on a minimal formulation. Successful learning occurs only under the presence of an implicit curriculum. I uncover the learned mechanisms by studying the attention maps in the trained transformers. I also study the training process, uncovering that attention heads always emerge in a specific sequence guided by the implicit curriculum.</description>

      <title>Barking Up The Syntactic Tree: Enhancing VLM Training with Syntactic Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) implicitly learn to associate image regions with words from large-scale training data, demonstrating an emergent capability for grounding concepts without dense annotations[14,18,51]. However, the coarse-grained supervision from image-caption pairs is often insufficient to resolve ambiguities in object-concept correspondence, even with enormous data volume. Rich semantic and syntactic structures within the text modality have been overlooked as sources of supervision. Starting from contrastive architectures (BLIP and ALBEF) that show strong intrinsic grounding abilities, we propose HIerarchically STructured Learning (HIST). HIST enhances spatial vision-language alignment without using additional human annotations, by hierarchically decomposing captions into the constituent Subjects, Phrases, and Composite Phrases, and enforcing entailment relation between a parent and its children in the hierarchy. Specifically, we introduce two novel loss functions: (1) Subject Loss, which aligns image content with the subject of the corresponding phrase, acting as an entailment of standard contrastive/matching losses at the Phrase level; (2) Composition Loss, to balance attention across multiple objects. HIST is general, and can be applied to any VLM for which attention between vision and language can be computed. Compared to baseline VLMs, HIST achieves up to +9.8% improvement in visual grounding and +6.3% in multi-object referring segmentation. Surprisingly, the improved spatial grounding leads to improvements in other downstream VLM tasks: +1.1% in image-text retrieval, and +0.2% in visual question answering.</description>

      <title>SpeechPrune: Context-aware Token Pruning for Speech Information Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Speech Information Retrieval (SIR), a new long-context task for Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs), and present SPIRAL, a 1,012-sample benchmark testing models' ability to extract critical details from approximately 90-second spoken inputs. While current Speech LLMs excel at short-form tasks, they struggle with the computational and representational demands of longer audio sequences. To address this limitation, we propose SpeechPrune, a training-free token pruning strategy that uses speech-text similarity and approximated attention scores to efficiently discard irrelevant tokens. In SPIRAL, SpeechPrune achieves accuracy improvements of 29% and up to 47% over the original model and the random pruning model at a pruning rate of 20%, respectively. SpeechPrune can maintain network performance even at a pruning level of 80%. This approach highlights the potential of token-level pruning for efficient and scalable long-form speech understanding.</description>

      <title>Know "No'' Better: A Data-Driven Approach for Enhancing Negation Awareness in CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While CLIP has significantly advanced multimodal understanding by bridging vision and language, the inability to grasp negation - such as failing to differentiate concepts like "parking" from "no parking" - poses substantial challenges. By analyzing the data used in the public CLIP model's pre-training, we posit this limitation stems from a lack of negation-inclusive data. To address this, we introduce data generation pipelines that employ a large language model (LLM) and a multimodal LLM to produce negation-inclusive captions. Fine-tuning CLIP with data generated from our pipelines, we develop NegationCLIP, which enhances negation awareness while preserving the generality. Moreover, to enable a comprehensive evaluation of negation understanding, we propose NegRefCOCOg-a benchmark tailored to test VLMs' ability to interpret negation across diverse expressions and positions within a sentence. Experiments on various CLIP architectures validate the effectiveness of our data generation pipelines in enhancing CLIP's ability to perceive negation accurately. Additionally, NegationCLIP's enhanced negation awareness has practical applications across various multimodal tasks, demonstrated by performance gains in text-to-image generation and referring image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Analyzing and Boosting the Power of Fine-Grained Visual Recognition for Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15140v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in various visual understanding tasks. However, MLLMs still struggle with fine-grained visual recognition (FGVR), which aims to identify subordinate-level categories from images. This can negatively impact more advanced capabilities of MLLMs, such as object-centric visual question answering and reasoning. In our study, we revisit three quintessential capabilities of MLLMs for FGVR, including object information extraction, category knowledge reserve, object-category alignment, and position of the root cause as a misalignment problem. To address this issue, we present Finedefics, an MLLM that enhances the model's FGVR capability by incorporating informative attribute descriptions of objects into the training phase. We employ contrastive learning on object-attribute pairs and attribute-category pairs simultaneously and use examples from similar but incorrect categories as hard negatives, naturally bringing representations of visual objects and category names closer. Extensive evaluations across multiple popular FGVR datasets demonstrate that Finedefics outperforms existing MLLMs of comparable parameter sizes, showcasing its remarkable efficacy. The code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ICST-MIPL/Finedefics_ICLR2025.</description>

      <title>Token Dynamics: Towards Efficient and Dynamic Video Token Representation for Video Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Token-based video representation has emerged as a promising approach for enabling LLMs to interpret video content. However, existing token reduction, such as token pruning and token merging, often disrupt essential spatial-temporal positional embeddings, failing to adequately balance computational efficiency with fewer tokens. Consequently, these methods result in lengthy token sequences, limiting their applicability in scenarios requiring extreme token compression, such as video large language models. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of extreme short token reduction, aiming to represent extensive video sequences with a minimal number of tokens. To address this challenge, we propose Token Dynamics, a new video representation framework that dynamically reduces token count while preserving spatial-temporal coherence. Specifically, we disentangle video representations by separating visual embeddings from grid-level motion information, structuring them into: 1. a concise token hash table, created by clustering tokens that describe object-level content; 2. a token indices key map, capturing detailed spatial-temporal motion patterns across grids; 3. a token hash function, which vector-quantizes the token hash table to reconstruct the token sequence from the key map. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-dynamics attention mechanism that integrates motion features into the token base without increasing token length, thereby maintaining compactness and spatial-temporal integrity. The experiments demonstrate a reduction of token count to merely 0.07% of the original tokens, with only a minor performance drop of 1.13%. Additionally, we propose two novel subtasks within extreme token reduction (fixed-length and adaptive-length compression). Our method offers significantly lower theoretical complexity, fewer tokens, and enhanced throughput, thus providing an efficient solution for video LLMs.</description>

      <title>The Mathematical Relationship Between Layer Normalization and Dynamic Activation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent paper proposes Dynamic Tanh (DyT) as a drop-in replacement for layer normalization (LN). Although the method is empirically well-motivated and appealing from a practical point of view, it lacks a theoretical foundation. In this work, we shed light on the mathematical relationship between layer normalization and dynamic activation functions. In particular, we derive DyT from LN and show that a well-defined approximation is needed to do so. By dropping said approximation, an alternative activation function is obtained, which we call Dynamic Inverse Square Root Unit (DyISRU). DyISRU is the exact counterpart of layer normalization, and we demonstrate numerically that it indeed resembles LN more accurately than DyT does.</description>

      <title>ActionStudio: A Lightweight Framework for Data and Training of Large Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Action models are essential for enabling autonomous agents to perform complex tasks. However, training large action models remains challenging due to the diversity of agent environments and the complexity of agentic data. Despite growing interest, existing infrastructure provides limited support for scalable, agent-specific fine-tuning. We present ActionStudio, a lightweight and extensible data and training framework designed for large action models. ActionStudio unifies heterogeneous agent trajectories through a standardized format, supports diverse training paradigms including LoRA, full fine-tuning, and distributed setups, and integrates robust preprocessing and verification tools. We validate its effectiveness across both public and realistic industry benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance and practical scalability. We open-sourced code and data at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/xLAM to facilitate research in the community.</description>
