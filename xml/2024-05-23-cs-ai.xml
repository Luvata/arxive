      <title>Fully Distributed Fog Load Balancing with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time Internet of Things (IoT) applications require real-time support to handle the ever-growing demand for computing resources to process IoT workloads. Fog Computing provides high availability of such resources in a distributed manner. However, these resources must be efficiently managed to distribute unpredictable traffic demands among heterogeneous Fog resources. This paper proposes a fully distributed load-balancing solution with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) that intelligently distributes IoT workloads to optimize the waiting time while providing fair resource utilization in the Fog network. These agents use transfer learning for life-long self-adaptation to dynamic changes in the environment. By leveraging distributed decision-making, MARL agents effectively minimize the waiting time compared to a single centralized agent solution and other baselines, enhancing end-to-end execution delay. Besides performance gain, a fully distributed solution allows for a global-scale implementation where agents can work independently in small collaboration regions, leveraging nearby local resources. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of a realistic frequency to observe the state of the environment, unlike the unrealistic common assumption in the literature of having observations readily available in real-time for every required action. The findings highlight the trade-off between realism and performance using an interval-based Gossip-based multi-casting protocol against assuming real-time observation availability for every generated workload.</description>

      <title>Layout Agnostic Human Activity Recognition in Smart Homes through Textual Descriptions Of Sensor Triggers (TDOST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) using ambient sensors in smart homes has numerous applications for human healthcare and wellness. However, building general-purpose HAR models that can be deployed to new smart home environments requires a significant amount of annotated sensor data and training overhead. Most smart homes vary significantly in their layouts, i.e., floor plans and the specifics of sensors embedded, resulting in low generalizability of HAR models trained for specific homes. We address this limitation by introducing a novel, layout-agnostic modeling approach for HAR systems in smart homes that utilizes the transferrable representational capacity of natural language descriptions of raw sensor data. To this end, we generate Textual Descriptions Of Sensor Triggers (TDOST) that encapsulate the surrounding trigger conditions and provide cues for underlying activities to the activity recognition models. Leveraging textual embeddings, rather than raw sensor data, we create activity recognition systems that predict standard activities across homes without either (re-)training or adaptation on target homes. Through an extensive evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TDOST-based models in unseen smart homes through experiments on benchmarked CASAS datasets. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of how the individual components of our approach affect downstream activity recognition performance.</description>

      <title>LLM+Reasoning+Planning for supporting incomplete user queries in presence of APIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of numerous LLM-based approaches aimed at providing natural language interfaces for various end-user tasks. These end-user tasks in turn can typically be accomplished by orchestrating a given set of APIs. In practice, natural language task requests (user queries) are often incomplete, i.e., they may not contain all the information required by the APIs. While LLMs excel at natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they frequently hallucinate on missing information or struggle with orchestrating the APIs. The key idea behind our proposed approach is to leverage logical reasoning and classical AI planning along with an LLM for accurately answering user queries including identification and gathering of any missing information in these queries. Our approach uses an LLM and ASP (Answer Set Programming) solver to translate a user query to a representation in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) via an intermediate representation in ASP. We introduce a special API "get_info_api" for gathering missing information. We model all the APIs as PDDL actions in a way that supports dataflow between the APIs. Our approach then uses a classical AI planner to generate an orchestration of API calls (including calls to get_info_api) to answer the user query. Our evaluation results show that our approach significantly outperforms a pure LLM based approach by achieving over 95\% success rate in most cases on a dataset containing complete and incomplete single goal and multi-goal queries where the multi-goal queries may or may not require dataflow among the APIs.</description>

      <title>DrHouse: An LLM-empowered Diagnostic Reasoning System through Harnessing Outcomes from Sensor Data and Expert Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to transform digital healthcare, as evidenced by recent advances in LLM-based virtual doctors. However, current approaches rely on patient's subjective descriptions of symptoms, causing increased misdiagnosis. Recognizing the value of daily data from smart devices, we introduce a novel LLM-based multi-turn consultation virtual doctor system, DrHouse, which incorporates three significant contributions: 1) It utilizes sensor data from smart devices in the diagnosis process, enhancing accuracy and reliability. 2) DrHouse leverages continuously updating medical databases such as Up-to-Date and PubMed to ensure our model remains at diagnostic standard's forefront. 3) DrHouse introduces a novel diagnostic algorithm that concurrently evaluates potential diseases and their likelihood, facilitating more nuanced and informed medical assessments. Through multi-turn interactions, DrHouse determines the next steps, such as accessing daily data from smart devices or requesting in-lab tests, and progressively refines its diagnoses. Evaluations on three public datasets and our self-collected datasets show that DrHouse can achieve up to an 18.8% increase in diagnosis accuracy over the state-of-the-art baselines. The results of a 32-participant user study show that 75% medical experts and 91.7% patients are willing to use DrHouse.</description>

      <title>Limits of Theory of Mind Modelling in Dialogue-Based Collaborative Plan Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work on dialogue-based collaborative plan acquisition (CPA) has suggested that Theory of Mind (ToM) modelling can improve missing knowledge prediction in settings with asymmetric skill-sets and knowledge. Although ToM was claimed to be important for effective collaboration, its real impact on this novel task remains under-explored. By representing plans as graphs and by exploiting task-specific constraints we show that, as performance on CPA nearly doubles when predicting one's own missing knowledge, the improvements due to ToM modelling diminish. This phenomenon persists even when evaluating existing baseline methods. To better understand the relevance of ToM for CPA, we report a principled performance comparison of models with and without ToM features. Results across different models and ablations consistently suggest that learned ToM features are indeed more likely to reflect latent patterns in the data with no perceivable link to ToM. This finding calls for a deeper understanding of the role of ToM in CPA and beyond, as well as new methods for modelling and evaluating mental states in computational collaborative agents.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Description Logics for Global Explanations of Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective for node classification in graph-structured data, but they lack explainability, especially at the global level. Current research mainly utilizes subgraphs of the input as local explanations or generates new graphs as global explanations. However, these graph-based methods are limited in their ability to explain classes with multiple sufficient explanations. To provide more expressive explanations, we propose utilizing class expressions (CEs) from the field of description logic (DL). Our approach explains heterogeneous graphs with different types of nodes using CEs in the EL description logic. To identify the best explanation among multiple candidate explanations, we employ and compare two different scoring functions: (1) For a given CE, we construct multiple graphs, have the GNN make a prediction for each graph, and aggregate the predicted scores. (2) We score the CE in terms of fidelity, i.e., we compare the predictions of the GNN to the predictions by the CE on a separate validation set. Instead of subgraph-based explanations, we offer CE-based explanations.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Enabled Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading for Dairy Farms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Farm businesses are increasingly adopting renewables to enhance energy efficiency and reduce reliance on fossil fuels and the grid. This shift aims to decrease dairy farms' dependence on traditional electricity grids by enabling the sale of surplus renewable energy in Peer-to-Peer markets. However, the dynamic nature of farm communities poses challenges, requiring specialized algorithms for P2P energy trading. To address this, the Multi-Agent Peer-to-Peer Dairy Farm Energy Simulator (MAPDES) has been developed, providing a platform to experiment with Reinforcement Learning techniques. The simulations demonstrate significant cost savings, including a 43% reduction in electricity expenses, a 42% decrease in peak demand, and a 1.91% increase in energy sales compared to baseline scenarios lacking peer-to-peer energy trading or renewable energy sources.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Approaches for Predictive Maintenance in the Steel Industry: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive Maintenance (PdM) emerged as one of the pillars of Industry 4.0, and became crucial for enhancing operational efficiency, allowing to minimize downtime, extend lifespan of equipment, and prevent failures. A wide range of PdM tasks can be performed using Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods, which often use data generated from industrial sensors. The steel industry, which is an important branch of the global economy, is one of the potential beneficiaries of this trend, given its large environmental footprint, the globalized nature of the market, and the demanding working conditions. This survey synthesizes the current state of knowledge in the field of AI-based PdM within the steel industry and is addressed to researchers and practitioners. We identified 219 articles related to this topic and formulated five research questions, allowing us to gain a global perspective on current trends and the main research gaps. We examined equipment and facilities subjected to PdM, determined common PdM approaches, and identified trends in the AI methods used to develop these solutions. We explored the characteristics of the data used in the surveyed articles and assessed the practical implications of the research presented there. Most of the research focuses on the blast furnace or hot rolling, using data from industrial sensors. Current trends show increasing interest in the domain, especially in the use of deep learning. The main challenges include implementing the proposed methods in a production environment, incorporating them into maintenance plans, and enhancing the accessibility and reproducibility of the research.</description>

      <title>Toward Constraint Compliant Goal Formulation and Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One part of complying with norms, rules, and preferences is incorporating constraints (such as knowledge of ethics) into one's goal formulation and planning processing. We explore in a simple domain how the encoding of knowledge in different ethical frameworks influences an agent's goal formulation and planning processing and demonstrate ability of an agent to satisfy and satisfice when its collection of relevant constraints includes a mix of "hard" and "soft" constraints of various types. How the agent attempts to comply with ethical constraints depends on the ethical framing and we investigate tradeoffs between deontological framing and utilitarian framing for complying with an ethical norm. Representative scenarios highlight how performing the same task with different framings of the same norm leads to different behaviors. Our explorations suggest an important role for metacognitive judgments in resolving ethical conflicts during goal formulation and planning.</description>

      <title>Influence based explainability of brain tumors segmentation in multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a fundamental tool in medical applications. Despite this rapid development, deep neural networks remain black boxes that are difficult to explain, and this represents a major limitation for their use in clinical practice. We focus on the segmentation of medical images task, where most explainability methods proposed so far provide a visual explanation in terms of an input saliency map. The aim of this work is to extend, implement and test instead an influence-based explainability algorithm, TracIn, proposed originally for classification tasks, in a challenging clinical problem, i.e., multiclass segmentation of tumor brains in multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging. We verify the faithfulness of the proposed algorithm linking the similarities of the latent representation of the network to the TracIn output. We further test the capacity of the algorithm to provide local and global explanations, and we suggest that it can be adopted as a tool to select the most relevant features used in the decision process. The method is generalizable for all semantic segmentation tasks where classes are mutually exclusive, which is the standard framework in these cases.</description>

      <title>Multi-task learning for molecular electronic structure approaching coupled-cluster accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) plays an important role in quantum chemistry, providing fast-to-evaluate predictive models for various properties of molecules. However, as most existing ML models for molecular electronic properties use density function theory (DFT) databases as the ground truth in training, their prediction accuracy cannot go beyond the DFT. In this work, we developed a unified ML method for electronic structures of organic molecules using the gold-standard CCSD(T) calculations as training data. Tested on hydrocarbon molecules, our model outperforms the DFT with the widely-used B3LYP functional in both computation costs and prediction accuracy of various quantum chemical properties. We apply the model to aromatic compounds and semiconducting polymers on both ground state and excited state properties, demonstrating its accuracy and generalization capability to complex systems that are hard to calculate using CCSD(T)-level methods.</description>

      <title>Identifying Functionally Important Features with End-to-End Sparse Dictionary Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying the features learned by neural networks is a core challenge in mechanistic interpretability. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs), which learn a sparse, overcomplete dictionary that reconstructs a network's internal activations, have been used to identify these features. However, SAEs may learn more about the structure of the datatset than the computational structure of the network. There is therefore only indirect reason to believe that the directions found in these dictionaries are functionally important to the network. We propose end-to-end (e2e) sparse dictionary learning, a method for training SAEs that ensures the features learned are functionally important by minimizing the KL divergence between the output distributions of the original model and the model with SAE activations inserted. Compared to standard SAEs, e2e SAEs offer a Pareto improvement: They explain more network performance, require fewer total features, and require fewer simultaneously active features per datapoint, all with no cost to interpretability. We explore geometric and qualitative differences between e2e SAE features and standard SAE features. E2e dictionary learning brings us closer to methods that can explain network behavior concisely and accurately. We release our library for training e2e SAEs and reproducing our analysis at https://github.com/ApolloResearch/e2e_sae</description>

      <title>Your Transformer is Secretly Linear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reveals a novel linear characteristic exclusive to transformer decoders, including models such as GPT, LLaMA, OPT, BLOOM and others. We analyze embedding transformations between sequential layers, uncovering a near-perfect linear relationship (Procrustes similarity score of 0.99). However, linearity decreases when the residual component is removed due to a consistently low output norm of the transformer layer. Our experiments show that removing or linearly approximating some of the most linear blocks of transformers does not affect significantly the loss or model performance. Moreover, in our pretraining experiments on smaller models we introduce a cosine-similarity-based regularization, aimed at reducing layer linearity. This regularization improves performance metrics on benchmarks like Tiny Stories and SuperGLUE and as well successfully decreases the linearity of the models. This study challenges the existing understanding of transformer architectures, suggesting that their operation may be more linear than previously assumed.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Deterministic Approximation Algorithm for Non-monotone Submodular Maximization under Knapsack Constraint with Linear Query Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the Submodular Maximization under Knapsack (SMK) constraint problem over the ground set of size $n$. The problem recently attracted a lot of attention due to its applications in various domains of combination optimization, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. We improve the approximation factor of the fastest deterministic algorithm from $6+\epsilon$ to $5+\epsilon$ while keeping the best query complexity of $O(n)$, where $\epsilon &gt;0$ is a constant parameter. Our technique is based on optimizing the performance of two components: the threshold greedy subroutine and the building of two disjoint sets as candidate solutions. Besides, by carefully analyzing the cost of candidate solutions, we obtain a tighter approximation factor.</description>

      <title>EXACT: Towards a platform for empirically benchmarking Machine Learning model explanation methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolving landscape of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to improve the interpretability of intricate machine learning (ML) models, yet faces challenges in formalisation and empirical validation, being an inherently unsupervised process. In this paper, we bring together various benchmark datasets and novel performance metrics in an initial benchmarking platform, the Explainable AI Comparison Toolkit (EXACT), providing a standardised foundation for evaluating XAI methods. Our datasets incorporate ground truth explanations for class-conditional features, and leveraging novel quantitative metrics, this platform assesses the performance of post-hoc XAI methods in the quality of the explanations they produce. Our recent findings have highlighted the limitations of popular XAI methods, as they often struggle to surpass random baselines, attributing significance to irrelevant features. Moreover, we show the variability in explanations derived from different equally performing model architectures. This initial benchmarking platform therefore aims to allow XAI researchers to test and assure the high quality of their newly developed methods.</description>

Abstract: Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) is a promising learning-based approach to solving various vehicle routing problems without much manual algorithm design. However, the current NCO methods mainly focus on the in-distribution performance, while the real-world problem instances usually come from different distributions. A costly fine-tuning approach or generalized model retraining from scratch could be needed to tackle the out-of-distribution instances. Unlike the existing methods, this work investigates an efficient prompt learning approach in NCO for cross-distribution adaptation. To be concrete, we propose a novel prompt learning method to facilitate fast zero-shot adaptation of a pre-trained model to solve routing problem instances from different distributions. The proposed model learns a set of prompts among various distributions and then selects the best-matched one to prompt a pre-trained attention model for each problem instance. Extensive experiments show that the proposed prompt learning approach facilitates the fast adaptation of pre-trained routing models. It also outperforms existing generalized models on both in-distribution prediction and zero-shot generalization to a diverse set of new tasks. Our code implementation is available online https://github.com/FeiLiu36/PromptVRP.</description>

Abstract: Adversarial Training is a proven defense strategy against adversarial malware. However, generating adversarial malware samples for this type of training presents a challenge because the resulting adversarial malware needs to remain evasive and functional. This work proposes an attack framework, EGAN, to address this limitation. EGAN leverages an Evolution Strategy and Generative Adversarial Network to select a sequence of attack actions that can mutate a Ransomware file while preserving its original functionality. We tested this framework on popular AI-powered commercial antivirus systems listed on VirusTotal and demonstrated that our framework is capable of bypassing the majority of these systems. Moreover, we evaluated whether the EGAN attack framework can evade other commercial non-AI antivirus solutions. Our results indicate that the adversarial ransomware generated can increase the probability of evading some of them.</description>

      <title>Perturbing the Gradient for Alleviating Meta Overfitting</title>

Abstract: The reason for Meta Overfitting can be attributed to two factors: Mutual Non-exclusivity and the Lack of diversity, consequent to which a single global function can fit the support set data of all the meta-training tasks and fail to generalize to new unseen tasks. This issue is evidenced by low error rates on the meta-training tasks, but high error rates on new tasks. However, there can be a number of novel solutions to this problem keeping in mind any of the two objectives to be attained, i.e. to increase diversity in the tasks and to reduce the confidence of the model for some of the tasks. In light of the above, this paper proposes a number of solutions to tackle meta-overfitting on few-shot learning settings, such as few-shot sinusoid regression and few shot classification. Our proposed approaches demonstrate improved generalization performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines for learning in a non-mutually exclusive task setting. Overall, this paper aims to provide insights into tackling overfitting in meta-learning and to advance the field towards more robust and generalizable models.</description>

      <title>A Study on Optimization Techniques for Variational Quantum Circuits in Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Computing aims to streamline machine learning, making it more effective with fewer trainable parameters. This reduction of parameters can speed up the learning process and reduce the use of computational resources. However, in the current phase of quantum computing development, known as the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era (NISQ), learning is difficult due to a limited number of qubits and widespread quantum noise. To overcome these challenges, researchers are focusing on variational quantum circuits (VQCs). VQCs are hybrid algorithms that merge a quantum circuit, which can be adjusted through parameters, with traditional classical optimization techniques. These circuits require only few qubits for effective learning. Recent studies have presented new ways of applying VQCs to reinforcement learning, showing promising results that warrant further exploration. This study investigates the effects of various techniques -- data re-uploading, input scaling, output scaling -- and introduces exponential learning rate decay in the quantum proximal policy optimization algorithm's actor-VQC. We assess these methods in the popular Frozen Lake and Cart Pole environments. Our focus is on their ability to reduce the number of parameters in the VQC without losing effectiveness. Our findings indicate that data re-uploading and an exponential learning rate decay significantly enhance hyperparameter stability and overall performance. While input scaling does not improve parameter efficiency, output scaling effectively manages greediness, leading to increased learning speed and robustness.</description>

Abstract: High-power multi-beam klystrons represent a key component to amplify RF to generate the accelerating field of the superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities at European XFEL. Exchanging these high-power components takes time and effort, thus it is necessary to minimize maintenance and downtime and at the same time maximize the device's operation. In an attempt to explore the behavior of klystrons using machine learning, we completed a series of experiments on our klystrons to determine various operational modes and conduct feature extraction and dimensionality reduction to extract the most valuable information about a normal operation. To analyze recorded data we used state-of-the-art data-driven learning techniques and recognized the most promising components that might help us better understand klystron operational states and identify early on possible faults or anomalies.</description>

      <title>Diffusion for World Modeling: Visual Details Matter in Atari</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: World models constitute a promising approach for training reinforcement learning agents in a safe and sample-efficient manner. Recent world models predominantly operate on sequences of discrete latent variables to model environment dynamics. However, this compression into a compact discrete representation may ignore visual details that are important for reinforcement learning. Concurrently, diffusion models have become a dominant approach for image generation, challenging well-established methods modeling discrete latents. Motivated by this paradigm shift, we introduce DIAMOND (DIffusion As a Model Of eNvironment Dreams), a reinforcement learning agent trained in a diffusion world model. We analyze the key design choices that are required to make diffusion suitable for world modeling, and demonstrate how improved visual details can lead to improved agent performance. DIAMOND achieves a mean human normalized score of 1.46 on the competitive Atari 100k benchmark; a new best for agents trained entirely within a world model. To foster future research on diffusion for world modeling, we release our code, agents and playable world models at https://github.com/eloialonso/diamond.</description>

      <title>A Unified Linear Programming Framework for Offline Reward Learning from Human Demonstrations and Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are pivotal methodologies in reward learning, which involve inferring and shaping the underlying reward function of sequential decision-making problems based on observed human demonstrations and feedback. Most prior work in reward learning has relied on prior knowledge or assumptions about decision or preference models, potentially leading to robustness issues. In response, this paper introduces a novel linear programming (LP) framework tailored for offline reward learning. Utilizing pre-collected trajectories without online exploration, this framework estimates a feasible reward set from the primal-dual optimality conditions of a suitably designed LP, and offers an optimality guarantee with provable sample efficiency. Our LP framework also enables aligning the reward functions with human feedback, such as pairwise trajectory comparison data, while maintaining computational tractability and sample efficiency. We demonstrate that our framework potentially achieves better performance compared to the conventional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach through analytical examples and numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>CoCo Matrix: Taxonomy of Cognitive Contributions in Co-writing with Intelligent Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in employing intelligent agents in writing. Previous work emphasizes the evaluation of the quality of end product-whether it was coherent and polished, overlooking the journey that led to the product, which is an invaluable dimension of the creative process. To understand how to recognize human efforts in co-writing with intelligent writing systems, we adapt Flower and Hayes' cognitive process theory of writing and propose CoCo Matrix, a two-dimensional taxonomy of entropy and information gain, to depict the new human-agent co-writing model. We define four quadrants and situate thirty-four published systems within the taxonomy. Our research found that low entropy and high information gain systems are under-explored, yet offer promising future directions in writing tasks that benefit from the agent's divergent planning and the human's focused translation. CoCo Matrix, not only categorizes different writing systems but also deepens our understanding of the cognitive processes in human-agent co-writing. By analyzing minimal changes in the writing process, CoCo Matrix serves as a proxy for the writer's mental model, allowing writers to reflect on their contributions. This reflection is facilitated through the measured metrics of information gain and entropy, which provide insights irrespective of the writing system used.</description>

      <title>Learning Structure and Knowledge Aware Representation with Large Language Models for Concept Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concept recommendation aims to suggest the next concept for learners to study based on their knowledge states and the human knowledge system. While knowledge states can be predicted using knowledge tracing models, previous approaches have not effectively integrated the human knowledge system into the process of designing these educational models. In the era of rapidly evolving Large Language Models (LLMs), many fields have begun using LLMs to generate and encode text, introducing external knowledge. However, integrating LLMs into concept recommendation presents two urgent challenges: 1) How to construct text for concepts that effectively incorporate the human knowledge system? 2) How to adapt non-smooth, anisotropic text encodings effectively for concept recommendation? In this paper, we propose a novel Structure and Knowledge Aware Representation learning framework for concept Recommendation (SKarREC). We leverage factual knowledge from LLMs as well as the precedence and succession relationships between concepts obtained from the knowledge graph to construct textual representations of concepts. Furthermore, we propose a graph-based adapter to adapt anisotropic text embeddings to the concept recommendation task. This adapter is pre-trained through contrastive learning on the knowledge graph to get a smooth and structure-aware concept representation. Then, it's fine-tuned through the recommendation task, forming a text-to-knowledge-to-recommendation adaptation pipeline, which effectively constructs a structure and knowledge-aware concept representation. Our method does a better job than previous adapters in transforming text encodings for application in concept recommendation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>PathOCL: Path-Based Prompt Augmentation for OCL Generation with GPT-4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress of AI-powered programming assistants, such as GitHub Copilot, has facilitated the development of software applications. These assistants rely on large language models (LLMs), which are foundation models (FMs) that support a wide range of tasks related to understanding and generating language. LLMs have demonstrated their ability to express UML model specifications using formal languages like the Object Constraint Language (OCL). However, the context size of the prompt is limited by the number of tokens an LLM can process. This limitation becomes significant as the size of UML class models increases. In this study, we introduce PathOCL, a novel path-based prompt augmentation technique designed to facilitate OCL generation. PathOCL addresses the limitations of LLMs, specifically their token processing limit and the challenges posed by large UML class models. PathOCL is based on the concept of chunking, which selectively augments the prompts with a subset of UML classes relevant to the English specification. Our findings demonstrate that PathOCL, compared to augmenting the complete UML class model (UML-Augmentation), generates a higher number of valid and correct OCL constraints using the GPT-4 model. Moreover, the average prompt size crafted using PathOCL significantly decreases when scaling the size of the UML class models.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Enhanced Spatio-Temporal Graph Transfer Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal graph neural networks have demonstrated efficacy in capturing complex dependencies for urban computing tasks such as forecasting and kriging. However, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on specific tasks, which limits their adaptability to new urban domains with varied demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to address this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, cross-task generalization remains underexplored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning methods due to the absence of a unified framework. To bridge this gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-enhanced transfer learning framework capable of adapting to diverse tasks in data-scarce domains. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables the capture of spatio-temporal dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, enabling the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties at each stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three downstream tasks forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation by a notable margin.</description>

      <title>Studying Up Public Sector AI: How Networks of Power Relations Shape Agency Decisions Around AI Design and Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As public sector agencies rapidly introduce new AI tools in high-stakes domains like social services, it becomes critical to understand how decisions to adopt these tools are made in practice. We borrow from the anthropological practice to ``study up'' those in positions of power, and reorient our study of public sector AI around those who have the power and responsibility to make decisions about the role that AI tools will play in their agency. Through semi-structured interviews and design activities with 16 agency decision-makers, we examine how decisions about AI design and adoption are influenced by their interactions with and assumptions about other actors within these agencies (e.g., frontline workers and agency leaders), as well as those above (legal systems and contracted companies), and below (impacted communities). By centering these networks of power relations, our findings shed light on how infrastructural, legal, and social factors create barriers and disincentives to the involvement of a broader range of stakeholders in decisions about AI design and adoption. Agency decision-makers desired more practical support for stakeholder involvement around public sector AI to help overcome the knowledge and power differentials they perceived between them and other stakeholders (e.g., frontline workers and impacted community members). Building on these findings, we discuss implications for future research and policy around actualizing participatory AI approaches in public sector contexts.</description>

      <title>WorldAfford: Affordance Grounding based on Natural Language Instructions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affordance grounding aims to localize the interaction regions for the manipulated objects in the scene image according to given instructions. A critical challenge in affordance grounding is that the embodied agent should understand human instructions and analyze which tools in the environment can be used, as well as how to use these tools to accomplish the instructions. Most recent works primarily supports simple action labels as input instructions for localizing affordance regions, failing to capture complex human objectives. Moreover, these approaches typically identify affordance regions of only a single object in object-centric images, ignoring the object context and struggling to localize affordance regions of multiple objects in complex scenes for practical applications. To address this concern, for the first time, we introduce a new task of affordance grounding based on natural language instructions, extending it from previously using simple labels for complex human instructions. For this new task, we propose a new framework, WorldAfford. We design a novel Affordance Reasoning Chain-of-Thought Prompting to reason about affordance knowledge from LLMs more precisely and logically. Subsequently, we use SAM and CLIP to localize the objects related to the affordance knowledge in the image. We identify the affordance regions of the objects through an affordance region localization module. To benchmark this new task and validate our framework, an affordance grounding dataset, LLMaFF, is constructed. We conduct extensive experiments to verify that WorldAfford performs state-of-the-art on both the previous AGD20K and the new LLMaFF dataset. In particular, WorldAfford can localize the affordance regions of multiple objects and provide an alternative when objects in the environment cannot fully match the given instruction.</description>

Abstract: Transformer-based models for long sequence time series forecasting (LSTF) problems have gained significant attention due to their exceptional forecasting precision. As the cornerstone of these models, the self-attention mechanism poses a challenge to efficient training and inference due to its quadratic time complexity. In this article, we propose a novel architectural design for Transformer-based models in LSTF, leveraging a substitution framework that incorporates Surrogate Attention Blocks and Surrogate FFN Blocks. The framework aims to boost any well-designed model's efficiency without sacrificing its accuracy. We further establish the equivalence of the Surrogate Attention Block to the self-attention mechanism in terms of both expressiveness and trainability. Through extensive experiments encompassing nine Transformer-based models across five time series tasks, we observe an average performance improvement of 9.45% while achieving a significant reduction in model size by 46%</description>

      <title>Stochastic Learning of Computational Resource Usage as Graph Structured Multimarginal Schr\"odinger Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to learn the time-varying stochastic computational resource usage of software as a graph structured Schr\"odinger bridge problem. In general, learning the computational resource usage from data is challenging because resources such as the number of CPU instructions and the number of last level cache requests are both time-varying and statistically correlated. Our proposed method enables learning the joint time-varying stochasticity in computational resource usage from the measured profile snapshots in a nonparametric manner. The method can be used to predict the most-likely time-varying distribution of computational resource availability at a desired time. We provide detailed algorithms for stochastic learning in both single and multi-core cases, discuss the convergence guarantees, computational complexities, and demonstrate their practical use in two case studies: a single-core nonlinear model predictive controller, and a synthetic multi-core software.</description>

      <title>Learning Partially Aligned Item Representation for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to uncover and transfer users' sequential preferences across multiple recommendation domains. While significant endeavors have been made, they primarily concentrated on developing advanced transfer modules and aligning user representations using self-supervised learning techniques. However, the problem of aligning item representations has received limited attention, and misaligned item representations can potentially lead to sub-optimal sequential modeling and user representation alignment. To this end, we propose a model-agnostic framework called \textbf{C}ross-domain item representation \textbf{A}lignment for \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{D}omain \textbf{S}equential \textbf{R}ecommendation (\textbf{CA-CDSR}), which achieves sequence-aware generation and adaptively partial alignment for item representations. Specifically, we first develop a sequence-aware feature augmentation strategy, which captures both collaborative and sequential item correlations, thus facilitating holistic item representation generation. Next, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the partial representation alignment problem from a spectrum perspective. It motivates us to devise an adaptive spectrum filter, achieving partial alignment adaptively. Furthermore, the aligned item representations can be fed into different sequential encoders to obtain user representations. The entire framework is optimized in a multi-task learning paradigm with an annealing strategy. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that CA-CDSR can surpass state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin and can effectively align items in representation spaces to enhance performance.</description>

      <title>GASE: Graph Attention Sampling with Edges Fusion for Solving Vehicle Routing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based methods have become increasingly popular for solving vehicle routing problems due to their near-optimal performance and fast inference speed. Among them, the combination of deep reinforcement learning and graph representation allows for the abstraction of node topology structures and features in an encoder-decoder style. Such an approach makes it possible to solve routing problems end-to-end without needing complicated heuristic operators designed by domain experts. Existing research studies have been focusing on novel encoding and decoding structures via various neural network models to enhance the node embedding representation. Despite the sophisticated approaches applied, there is a noticeable lack of consideration for the graph-theoretic properties inherent to routing problems. Moreover, the potential ramifications of inter-nodal interactions on the decision-making efficacy of the models have not been adequately explored. To bridge this gap, we propose an adaptive Graph Attention Sampling with the Edges Fusion framework (GASE),where nodes' embedding is determined through attention calculation from certain highly correlated neighbourhoods and edges, utilizing a filtered adjacency matrix. In detail, the selections of particular neighbours and adjacency edges are led by a multi-head attention mechanism, contributing directly to the message passing and node embedding in graph attention sampling networks. Furthermore, we incorporate an adaptive actor-critic algorithm with policy improvements to expedite the training convergence. We then conduct comprehensive experiments against baseline methods on learning-based VRP tasks from different perspectives. Our proposed model outperforms the existing methods by 2.08\%-6.23\% and shows stronger generalization ability, achieving state-of-the-art performance on randomly generated instances and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Time Matters: Enhancing Pre-trained News Recommendation Models with Robust User Dwell Time Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized text comprehension, leading to State-of-the-Art (SOTA) news recommendation models that utilize LLMs for in-depth news understanding. Despite this, accurately modeling user preferences remains challenging due to the inherent uncertainty of click behaviors. Techniques like multi-head attention in Transformers seek to alleviate this by capturing interactions among clicks, yet they fall short in integrating explicit feedback signals. User Dwell Time emerges as a powerful indicator, offering the potential to enhance the weak signals emanating from clicks. Nonetheless, its real-world applicability is questionable, especially when dwell time data collection is subject to delays. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes two novel and robust dwell time injection strategies, namely Dwell time Weight (DweW) and Dwell time Aware (DweA). Dwe} concentrates on refining Effective User Clicks through detailed analysis of dwell time, integrating with initial behavioral inputs to construct a more robust user preference. DweA empowers the model with awareness of dwell time information, thereby facilitating autonomous adjustment of attention values in user modeling. This enhancement sharpens the model's ability to accurately identify user preferences. In our experiment using the real-world news dataset from MSN website, we validated that our two strategies significantly improve recommendation performance, favoring high-quality news. Crucially, our approaches exhibit robustness to user dwell time information, maintaining their ability to recommend high-quality content even in extreme cases where dwell time data is entirely missing.</description>

      <title>Exploring and Exploiting the Asymmetric Valley of Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring the loss landscape offers insights into the inherent principles of deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent work suggests an additional asymmetry of the valley beyond the flat and sharp ones, yet without thoroughly examining its causes or implications. Our study methodically explores the factors affecting the symmetry of DNN valleys, encompassing (1) the dataset, network architecture, initialization, and hyperparameters that influence the convergence point; and (2) the magnitude and direction of the noise for 1D visualization. Our major observation shows that the {\it degree of sign consistency} between the noise and the convergence point is a critical indicator of valley symmetry. Theoretical insights from the aspects of ReLU activation and softmax function could explain the interesting phenomenon. Our discovery propels novel understanding and applications in the scenario of Model Fusion: (1) the efficacy of interpolating separate models significantly correlates with their sign consistency ratio, and (2) imposing sign alignment during federated learning emerges as an innovative approach for model parameter alignment.</description>

      <title>EntropyStop: Unsupervised Deep Outlier Detection with Loss Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised Outlier Detection (UOD) is an important data mining task. With the advance of deep learning, deep Outlier Detection (OD) has received broad interest. Most deep UOD models are trained exclusively on clean datasets to learn the distribution of the normal data, which requires huge manual efforts to clean the real-world data if possible. Instead of relying on clean datasets, some approaches directly train and detect on unlabeled contaminated datasets, leading to the need for methods that are robust to such conditions. Ensemble methods emerged as a superior solution to enhance model robustness against contaminated training sets. However, the training time is greatly increased by the ensemble.
  In this study, we investigate the impact of outliers on the training phase, aiming to halt training on unlabeled contaminated datasets before performance degradation. Initially, we noted that blending normal and anomalous data causes AUC fluctuations, a label-dependent measure of detection accuracy. To circumvent the need for labels, we propose a zero-label entropy metric named Loss Entropy for loss distribution, enabling us to infer optimal stopping points for training without labels. Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate negative correlation between entropy metric and the label-based AUC. Based on this, we develop an automated early-stopping algorithm, EntropyStop, which halts training when loss entropy suggests the maximum model detection capability. We conduct extensive experiments on ADBench (including 47 real datasets), and the overall results indicate that AutoEncoder (AE) enhanced by our approach not only achieves better performance than ensemble AEs but also requires under 1\% of training time. Lastly, our proposed metric and early-stopping approach are evaluated on other deep OD models, exhibiting their broad potential applicability.</description>

      <title>Rethink Predicting the Optical Flow with the Kinetics Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical flow estimation is one of the fundamental tasks in low-level computer vision, which describes the pixel-wise displacement and can be used in many other tasks. From the apparent aspect, the optical flow can be viewed as the correlation between the pixels in consecutive frames, so continuously refining the correlation volume can achieve an outstanding performance. However, it will make the method have a catastrophic computational complexity. Not only that, the error caused by the occlusion regions of the successive frames will be amplified through the inaccurate warp operation. These challenges can not be solved only from the apparent view, so this paper rethinks the optical flow estimation from the kinetics viewpoint.We propose a method combining the apparent and kinetics information from this motivation. The proposed method directly predicts the optical flow from the feature extracted from images instead of building the correlation volume, which will improve the efficiency of the whole network. Meanwhile, the proposed method involves a new differentiable warp operation that simultaneously considers the warping and occlusion. Moreover, the proposed method blends the kinetics feature with the apparent feature through the novel self-supervised loss function. Furthermore, comprehensive experiments and ablation studies prove that the proposed novel insight into how to predict the optical flow can achieve the better performance of the state-of-the-art methods, and in some metrics, the proposed method outperforms the correlation-based method, especially in situations containing occlusion and fast moving. The code will be public.</description>

      <title>Future You: A Conversation with an AI-Generated Future Self Reduces Anxiety, Negative Emotions, and Increases Future Self-Continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce "Future You," an interactive, brief, single-session, digital chat intervention designed to improve future self-continuity--the degree of connection an individual feels with a temporally distant future self--a characteristic that is positively related to mental health and wellbeing. Our system allows users to chat with a relatable yet AI-powered virtual version of their future selves that is tuned to their future goals and personal qualities. To make the conversation realistic, the system generates a "synthetic memory"--a unique backstory for each user--that creates a throughline between the user's present age (between 18-30) and their life at age 60. The "Future You" character also adopts the persona of an age-progressed image of the user's present self. After a brief interaction with the "Future You" character, users reported decreased anxiety, and increased future self-continuity. This is the first study successfully demonstrating the use of personalized AI-generated characters to improve users' future self-continuity and wellbeing.</description>

      <title>MAGE: Model-Level Graph Neural Networks Explanations via Motif-based Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in molecular tasks, yet their interpretability remains challenging. Traditional model-level explanation methods like XGNN and GNNInterpreter often fail to identify valid substructures like rings, leading to questionable interpretability. This limitation stems from XGNN's atom-by-atom approach and GNNInterpreter's reliance on average graph embeddings, which overlook the essential structural elements crucial for molecules. To address these gaps, we introduce an innovative \textbf{M}otif-b\textbf{A}sed \textbf{G}NN \textbf{E}xplainer (MAGE) that uses motifs as fundamental units for generating explanations. Our approach begins with extracting potential motifs through a motif decomposition technique. Then, we utilize an attention-based learning method to identify class-specific motifs. Finally, we employ a motif-based graph generator for each class to create molecular graph explanations based on these class-specific motifs. This novel method not only incorporates critical substructures into the explanations but also guarantees their validity, yielding results that are human-understandable. Our proposed method's effectiveness is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative assessments conducted on six real-world molecular datasets.</description>

      <title>Single Image Unlearning: Efficient Machine Unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning empowers individuals with the `right to be forgotten' by removing their private or sensitive information encoded in machine learning models. However, it remains uncertain whether MU can be effectively applied to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly in scenarios of forgetting the leaked visual data of concepts. To overcome the challenge, we propose an efficient method, Single Image Unlearning (SIU), to unlearn the visual recognition of a concept by fine-tuning a single associated image for few steps. SIU consists of two key aspects: (i) Constructing Multifaceted fine-tuning data. We introduce four targets, based on which we construct fine-tuning data for the concepts to be forgotten; (ii) Jointly training loss. To synchronously forget the visual recognition of concepts and preserve the utility of MLLMs, we fine-tune MLLMs through a novel Dual Masked KL-divergence Loss combined with Cross Entropy loss. Alongside our method, we establish MMUBench, a new benchmark for MU in MLLMs and introduce a collection of metrics for its evaluation. Experimental results on MMUBench show that SIU completely surpasses the performance of existing methods. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that SIU can avoid invasive membership inference attacks and jailbreak attacks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore MU in MLLMs. We will release the code and benchmark in the near future.</description>

      <title>Like Humans to Few-Shot Learning through Knowledge Permeation of Vision and Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-shot learning aims to generalize the recognizer from seen categories to an entirely novel scenario. With only a few support samples, several advanced methods initially introduce class names as prior knowledge for identifying novel classes. However, obstacles still impede achieving a comprehensive understanding of how to harness the mutual advantages of visual and textual knowledge. In this paper, we propose a coherent Bidirectional Knowledge Permeation strategy called BiKop, which is grounded in a human intuition: A class name description offers a general representation, whereas an image captures the specificity of individuals. BiKop primarily establishes a hierarchical joint general-specific representation through bidirectional knowledge permeation. On the other hand, considering the bias of joint representation towards the base set, we disentangle base-class-relevant semantics during training, thereby alleviating the suppression of potential novel-class-relevant information. Experiments on four challenging benchmarks demonstrate the remarkable superiority of BiKop. Our code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Tiny Refinements Elicit Resilience: Toward Efficient Prefix-Model Against LLM Red-Teaming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the proliferation of red-teaming strategies for Large Language Models (LLMs), the deficiency in the literature about improving the safety and robustness of LLM defense strategies is becoming increasingly pronounced. This paper introduces the LLM-based \textbf{sentinel} model as a plug-and-play prefix module designed to reconstruct the input prompt with just a few ($&lt;30$) additional tokens, effectively reducing toxicity in responses from target LLMs. The sentinel model naturally overcomes the \textit{parameter inefficiency} and \textit{limited model accessibility} for fine-tuning large target models. We employ an interleaved training regimen using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize both red team and sentinel models dynamically, incorporating a value head-sharing mechanism inspired by the multi-agent centralized critic to manage the complex interplay between agents. Our extensive experiments across text-to-text and text-to-image demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating toxic outputs, even when dealing with larger models like \texttt{Llama-2}, \texttt{GPT-3.5} and \texttt{Stable-Diffusion}, highlighting the potential of our framework in enhancing safety and robustness in various applications.</description>

Abstract: Open source large language models (LLMs) have shown great improvements in recent times. However, many of these models are focused solely on popular spoken languages. We present a high quality dataset of more than 70k prompt-response pairs in 74 languages which consist of human generated prompts and synthetic responses. We use this dataset to train a state-of-the-art open source English LLM to chat multilingually. We evaluate our model on MT-Bench chat benchmarks in 6 languages, finding that our multilingual model outperforms previous state-of-the-art open source LLMs across each language. We further find that training on more multilingual data is beneficial to the performance in a chosen target language (Japanese) compared to simply training on only data in that language. These results indicate the necessity of training on large amounts of high quality multilingual data to make a more accessible LLM.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Emergence in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergence, broadly conceptualized as the ``intelligent'' behaviors of LLMs, has recently been studied and proved challenging to quantify due to the lack of a measurable definition. Most commonly, it has been estimated statistically through model performances across extensive datasets and tasks, which consumes significant resources. In addition, such estimation is difficult to interpret and may not accurately reflect the models' intrinsic emergence. In this work, we propose a quantifiable solution for estimating emergence. Inspired by emergentism in dynamics, we quantify the strength of emergence by comparing the entropy reduction of the macroscopic (semantic) level with that of the microscopic (token) level, both of which are derived from the representations within the transformer block. Using a low-cost estimator, our quantification method demonstrates consistent behaviors across a suite of LMs (GPT-2, GEMMA, etc.) under both in-context learning (ICL) and natural sentences. Empirical results show that (1) our method gives consistent measurements which align with existing observations based on performance metrics, validating the effectiveness of our emergence quantification; (2) our proposed metric uncovers novel emergence patterns such as the correlations between the variance of our metric and the number of ``shots'' in ICL, which further suggests a new way of interpreting hallucinations in LLMs; (3) we offer a potential solution towards estimating the emergence of larger and closed-resource LMs via smaller LMs like GPT-2. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/Zodiark-ch/Emergence-of-LLMs/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots playing soccer often rely on hard-coded behaviors that struggle to generalize when the game environment change. In this paper, we propose a temporal logic based approach that allows robots' behaviors and goals to adapt to the semantics of the environment. In particular, we present a hierarchical representation of soccer in which the robot selects the level of operation based on the perceived semantic characteristics of the environment, thus modifying dynamically the set of rules and goals to apply. The proposed approach enables the robot to operate in unstructured environments, just as it happens when humans go from soccer played on an official field to soccer played on a street. Three different use cases set in different scenarios are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionised the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in practically every task in this field. However, the prevalent approach used in text generation, Causal Language Modelling (CLM), which generates text sequentially from left to right, inherently limits the freedom of the model, which does not decide when and where each token is generated. In contrast, Masked Language Modelling (MLM), primarily used for language understanding tasks, can generate tokens anywhere in the text and any order. This paper conducts an extensive comparison of MLM and CLM approaches for text generation tasks. To do so, we pre-train several language models of comparable sizes on three different datasets, namely 1) medical discharge summaries, 2) movie plot synopses, and 3) authorship verification datasets. To assess the quality of the generations, we first employ quantitative metrics and then perform a qualitative human evaluation to analyse coherence and grammatical correctness. In addition, we evaluate the usefulness of the generated texts by using them in three different downstream tasks: 1) Entity Recognition, 2) Text Classification, and 3) Authorship Verification. The results show that MLM consistently outperforms CLM in text generation across all datasets, with higher quantitative scores and better coherence in the generated text. The study also finds \textit{no strong correlation} between the quality of the generated text and the performance of the models in the downstream tasks. With this study, we show that MLM for text generation has great potential for future research and provides direction for future studies in this area.</description>

Abstract: Haar Cascade is a cost-effective and user-friendly machine learning-based algorithm for detecting objects in images and videos. Unlike Deep Learning algorithms, which typically require significant resources and expensive computing costs, it uses simple image processing techniques like edge detection and Haar features that are easy to comprehend and implement. By combining Haar Cascade with OpenCV2 on an embedded computer like the NVIDIA Jetson Nano, this system can accurately detect and match faces in a database for attendance tracking. This system aims to achieve several specific objectives that set it apart from existing solutions. It leverages Haar Cascade, enriched with carefully selected Haar features, such as Haar-like wavelets, and employs advanced edge detection techniques. These techniques enable precise face detection and matching in both images and videos, contributing to high accuracy and robust performance. By doing so, it minimizes manual intervention and reduces errors, thereby strengthening accountability. Additionally, the integration of OpenCV2 and the NVIDIA Jetson Nano optimizes processing efficiency, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. This system caters to a diverse range of educational institutions, including schools, colleges, vocational training centers, and various workplace settings such as small businesses, offices, and factories. ... The system's affordability and efficiency democratize attendance management technology, making it accessible to a broader audience. Consequently, it has the potential to transform attendance tracking and management practices, ultimately leading to heightened productivity and accountability. In conclusion, this system represents a groundbreaking approach to attendance tracking and management...</description>

      <title>Scene Graph Generation Strategy with Co-occurrence Knowledge and Learnable Term Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scene graph generation (SGG) is an important task in image understanding because it represents the relationships between objects in an image as a graph structure, making it possible to understand the semantic relationships between objects intuitively. Previous SGG studies used a message-passing neural networks (MPNN) to update features, which can effectively reflect information about surrounding objects. However, these studies have failed to reflect the co-occurrence of objects during SGG generation. In addition, they only addressed the long-tail problem of the training dataset from the perspectives of sampling and learning methods. To address these two problems, we propose CooK, which reflects the Co-occurrence Knowledge between objects, and the learnable term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-l-IDF) to solve the long-tail problem. We applied the proposed model to the SGG benchmark dataset, and the results showed a performance improvement of up to 3.8% compared with existing state-of-the-art models in SGGen subtask. The proposed method exhibits generalization ability from the results obtained, showing uniform performance improvement for all MPNN models.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Language Model for Extreme Multi-Label Knowledge Graph Link Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extrapolation in Large language models (LLMs) for open-ended inquiry encounters two pivotal issues: (1) hallucination and (2) expensive training costs. These issues present challenges for LLMs in specialized domains and personalized data, requiring truthful responses and low fine-tuning costs. Existing works attempt to tackle the problem by augmenting the input of a smaller language model with information from a knowledge graph (KG). However, they have two limitations: (1) failing to extract relevant information from a large one-hop neighborhood in KG and (2) applying the same augmentation strategy for KGs with different characteristics that may result in low performance. Moreover, open-ended inquiry typically yields multiple responses, further complicating extrapolation. We propose a new task, the extreme multi-label KG link prediction task, to enable a model to perform extrapolation with multiple responses using structured real-world knowledge. Our retriever identifies relevant one-hop neighbors by considering entity, relation, and textual data together. Our experiments demonstrate that (1) KGs with different characteristics require different augmenting strategies, and (2) augmenting the language model's input with textual data improves task performance significantly. By incorporating the retrieval-augmented framework with KG, our framework, with a small parameter size, is able to extrapolate based on a given KG. The code can be obtained on GitHub: https://github.com/exiled1143/Retrieval-Augmented-Language-Model-for-Multi-Label-Knowledge-Graph-Link-Prediction.git</description>

      <title>Mitigating Overconfidence in Out-of-Distribution Detection by Capturing Extreme Activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) instances is crucial for the reliable deployment of machine learning models in real-world scenarios. OOD inputs are commonly expected to cause a more uncertain prediction in the primary task; however, there are OOD cases for which the model returns a highly confident prediction. This phenomenon, denoted as "overconfidence", presents a challenge to OOD detection. Specifically, theoretical evidence indicates that overconfidence is an intrinsic property of certain neural network architectures, leading to poor OOD detection. In this work, we address this issue by measuring extreme activation values in the penultimate layer of neural networks and then leverage this proxy of overconfidence to improve on several OOD detection baselines. We test our method on a wide array of experiments spanning synthetic data and real-world data, tabular and image datasets, multiple architectures such as ResNet and Transformer, different training loss functions, and include the scenarios examined in previous theoretical work. Compared to the baselines, our method often grants substantial improvements, with double-digit increases in OOD detection AUC, and it does not damage performance in any scenario.</description>

      <title>Spotting AI's Touch: Identifying LLM-Paraphrased Spans in Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-generated text detection has attracted increasing attention as powerful language models approach human-level generation. Limited work is devoted to detecting (partially) AI-paraphrased texts. However, AI paraphrasing is commonly employed in various application scenarios for text refinement and diversity. To this end, we propose a novel detection framework, paraphrased text span detection (PTD), aiming to identify paraphrased text spans within a text. Different from text-level detection, PTD takes in the full text and assigns each of the sentences with a score indicating the paraphrasing degree. We construct a dedicated dataset, PASTED, for paraphrased text span detection. Both in-distribution and out-of-distribution results demonstrate the effectiveness of PTD models in identifying AI-paraphrased text spans. Statistical and model analysis explains the crucial role of the surrounding context of the paraphrased text spans. Extensive experiments show that PTD models can generalize to versatile paraphrasing prompts and multiple paraphrased text spans. We release our resources at https://github.com/Linzwcs/PASTED.</description>

      <title>OLAPH: Improving Factuality in Biomedical Long-form Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the medical domain, numerous scenarios necessitate the long-form generation ability of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, when addressing patients' questions, it is essential that the model's response conveys factual claims, highlighting the need for an automated method to evaluate those claims. Thus, we introduce MedLFQA, a benchmark dataset reconstructed using long-form question-answering datasets related to the biomedical domain. We use MedLFQA to facilitate the automatic evaluations of factuality. We also propose OLAPH, a simple and novel framework that enables the improvement of factuality through automatic evaluations. The OLAPH framework iteratively trains LLMs to mitigate hallucinations using sampling predictions and preference optimization. In other words, we iteratively set the highest-scoring response as a preferred response derived from sampling predictions and train LLMs to align with the preferred response that improves factuality. We highlight that, even on evaluation metrics not used during training, LLMs trained with our OLAPH framework demonstrate significant performance improvement in factuality. Our findings reveal that a 7B LLM trained with our OLAPH framework can provide long answers comparable to the medical experts' answers in terms of factuality. We believe that our work could shed light on gauging the long-text generation ability of LLMs in the medical domain. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/OLAPH}{https://github.com/dmis-lab/OLAPH.</description>

      <title>A Masked Semi-Supervised Learning Approach for Otago Micro Labels Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Otago Exercise Program (OEP) serves as a vital rehabilitation initiative for older adults, aiming to enhance their strength and balance, and consequently prevent falls. While Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems have been widely employed in recognizing the activities of individuals, existing systems focus on the duration of macro activities (i.e. a sequence of repetitions of the same exercise), neglecting the ability to discern micro activities (i.e. the individual repetitions of the exercises), in the case of OEP. This study presents a novel semi-supervised machine learning approach aimed at bridging this gap in recognizing the micro activities of OEP. To manage the limited dataset size, our model utilizes a Transformer encoder for feature extraction, subsequently classified by a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Simultaneously, the Transformer encoder is employed for masked unsupervised learning to reconstruct input signals. Results indicate that the masked unsupervised learning task enhances the performance of the supervised learning (classification task), as evidenced by f1-scores surpassing the clinically applicable threshold of 0.8. From the micro activities, two clinically relevant outcomes emerge: counting the number of repetitions of each exercise and calculating the velocity during chair rising. These outcomes enable the automatic monitoring of exercise intensity and difficulty in the daily lives of older adults.</description>

      <title>From Human-to-Human to Human-to-Bot Conversations in Software Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software developers use natural language to interact not only with other humans, but increasingly also with chatbots. These interactions have different properties and flow differently based on what goal the developer wants to achieve and who they interact with. In this paper, we aim to understand the dynamics of conversations that occur during modern software development after the integration of AI and chatbots, enabling a deeper recognition of the advantages and disadvantages of including chatbot interactions in addition to human conversations in collaborative work. We compile existing conversation attributes with humans and NLU-based chatbots and adapt them to the context of software development. Then, we extend the comparison to include LLM-powered chatbots based on an observational study. We present similarities and differences between human-to-human and human-to-bot conversations, also distinguishing between NLU- and LLM-based chatbots. Furthermore, we discuss how understanding the differences among the conversation styles guides the developer on how to shape their expectations from a conversation and consequently support the communication within a software team. We conclude that the recent conversation styles that we observe with LLM-chatbots can not replace conversations with humans due to certain attributes regarding social aspects despite their ability to support productivity and decrease the developers' mental load.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive review of the future of cybersecurity through Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). We explore LLM applications across various domains, including hardware design security, intrusion detection, software engineering, design verification, cyber threat intelligence, malware detection, and phishing detection. We present an overview of LLM evolution and its current state, focusing on advancements in models such as GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Mixtral-8x7B, BERT, Falcon2, and LLaMA. Our analysis extends to LLM vulnerabilities, such as prompt injection, insecure output handling, data poisoning, DDoS attacks, and adversarial instructions. We delve into mitigation strategies to protect these models, providing a comprehensive look at potential attack scenarios and prevention techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of 42 LLM models in cybersecurity knowledge and hardware security, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. We thoroughly evaluate cybersecurity datasets for LLM training and testing, covering the lifecycle from data creation to usage and identifying gaps for future research. In addition, we review new strategies for leveraging LLMs, including techniques like Half-Quadratic Quantization (HQQ), Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Quantized Low-Rank Adapters (QLoRA), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These insights aim to enhance real-time cybersecurity defenses and improve the sophistication of LLM applications in threat detection and response. Our paper provides a foundational understanding and strategic direction for integrating LLMs into future cybersecurity frameworks, emphasizing innovation and robust model deployment to safeguard against evolving cyber threats.</description>

Abstract: Studying the sun's outer atmosphere is challenging due to its complex magnetic fields impacting solar activities. Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations help model these interactions but are extremely time-consuming (usually on a scale of days). Our research applies the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to accelerate the coronal magnetic field modeling, specifically, the Bifrost MHD model. We apply Tensorized FNO (TFNO) to generate solutions from partial differential equations (PDEs) over a 3D domain efficiently. TFNO's performance is compared with other deep learning methods, highlighting its accuracy and scalability. Physics analysis confirms that TFNO is reliable and capable of accelerating MHD simulations with high precision. This advancement improves efficiency in data handling, enhances predictive capabilities, and provides a better understanding of magnetic topologies.</description>

      <title>Progress Measures for Grokking on Real-world Datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grokking, a phenomenon where machine learning models generalize long after overfitting, has been primarily observed and studied in algorithmic tasks. This paper explores grokking in real-world datasets using deep neural networks for classification under the cross-entropy loss. We challenge the prevalent hypothesis that the $L_2$ norm of weights is the primary cause of grokking by demonstrating that grokking can occur outside the expected range of weight norms. To better understand grokking, we introduce three new progress measures: activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, and approximate local circuit complexity. These measures are conceptually related to generalization and demonstrate a stronger correlation with grokking in real-world datasets compared to weight norms. Our findings suggest that while weight norms might usually correlate with grokking and our progress measures, they are not causative, and our proposed measures provide a better understanding of the dynamics of grokking.</description>

      <title>Blind Separation of Vibration Sources using Deep Learning and Deconvolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibrations of rotating machinery primarily originate from two sources, both of which are distorted by the machine's transfer function on their way to the sensor: the dominant gear-related vibrations and a low-energy signal linked to bearing faults. The proposed method facilitates the blind separation of vibration sources, eliminating the need for any information about the monitored equipment or external measurements. This method estimates both sources in two stages: initially, the gear signal is isolated using a dilated CNN, followed by the estimation of the bearing fault signal using the squared log envelope of the residual. The effect of the transfer function is removed from both sources using a novel whitening-based deconvolution method (WBD). Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the method's ability to detect bearing failures early when no additional information is available. This study considers both local and distributed bearing faults, assuming that the vibrations are recorded under stable operating conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering the semantics of multimodal utterances is essential for understanding human language and enhancing human-machine interactions. Existing methods manifest limitations in leveraging nonverbal information for discerning complex semantics in unsupervised scenarios. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised multimodal clustering method (UMC), making a pioneering contribution to this field. UMC introduces a unique approach to constructing augmentation views for multimodal data, which are then used to perform pre-training to establish well-initialized representations for subsequent clustering. An innovative strategy is proposed to dynamically select high-quality samples as guidance for representation learning, gauged by the density of each sample's nearest neighbors. Besides, it is equipped to automatically determine the optimal value for the top-$K$ parameter in each cluster to refine sample selection. Finally, both high- and low-quality samples are used to learn representations conducive to effective clustering. We build baselines on benchmark multimodal intent and dialogue act datasets. UMC shows remarkable improvements of 2-6\% scores in clustering metrics over state-of-the-art methods, marking the first successful endeavor in this domain.

Abstract: This paper establishes a mathematical foundation for the Adam optimizer, elucidating its connection to natural gradient descent through Riemannian and information geometry. We rigorously analyze the diagonal empirical Fisher information matrix (FIM) in Adam, clarifying all detailed approximations and advocating for the use of log probability functions as loss, which should be based on discrete distributions, due to the limitations of empirical FIM. Our analysis uncovers flaws in the original Adam algorithm, leading to proposed corrections such as enhanced momentum calculations, adjusted bias corrections, and gradient clipping. We refine the weight decay term based on our theoretical framework. Our modified algorithm, Fisher Adam (FAdam), demonstrates superior performance across diverse domains including LLM, ASR, and VQ-VAE, achieving state-of-the-art results in ASR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown impressive capabilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, a systematic investigation of their potential in this field remains largely unexplored. This study aims to address this gap by exploring the following questions: (1) How are LLMs currently applied to NLP tasks in the literature? (2) Have traditional NLP tasks already been solved with LLMs? (3) What is the future of the LLMs for NLP? To answer these questions, we take the first step to provide a comprehensive overview of LLMs in NLP. Specifically, we first introduce a unified taxonomy including (1) parameter-frozen application and (2) parameter-tuning application to offer a unified perspective for understanding the current progress of LLMs in NLP. Furthermore, we summarize the new frontiers and the associated challenges, aiming to inspire further groundbreaking advancements. We hope this work offers valuable insights into the {potential and limitations} of LLMs in NLP, while also serving as a practical guide for building effective LLMs in NLP.</description>

      <title>Wav-KAN: Wavelet Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper , we introduce Wav-KAN, an innovative neural network architecture that leverages the Wavelet Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (Wav-KAN) framework to enhance interpretability and performance. Traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and even recent advancements like Spl-KAN face challenges related to interpretability, training speed, robustness, computational efficiency, and performance. Wav-KAN addresses these limitations by incorporating wavelet functions into the Kolmogorov-Arnold network structure, enabling the network to capture both high-frequency and low-frequency components of the input data efficiently. Wavelet-based approximations employ orthogonal or semi-orthogonal basis and also maintains a balance between accurately representing the underlying data structure and avoiding overfitting to the noise. Analogous to how water conforms to the shape of its container, Wav-KAN adapts to the data structure, resulting in enhanced accuracy, faster training speeds, and increased robustness compared to Spl-KAN and MLPs. Our results highlight the potential of Wav-KAN as a powerful tool for developing interpretable and high-performance neural networks, with applications spanning various fields. This work sets the stage for further exploration and implementation of Wav-KAN in frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and also it makes wavelet in KAN in wide-spread usage like nowadays activation functions like ReLU, sigmoid in universal approximation theory (UAT).</description>

      <title>Training and inference in the ReckON RSNN architecture implemented on a MPSoC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence, biological neuron models are being used to implement neural networks that can learn certain tasks after a training phase. One type of such networks are spiking neural networks (SNNs) that rely on a simplified model for biological neurons, the Integrate and Fire neuron. Several accelerators have emerged to implement SNNs with this kind of neuron. The ReckON system is one of these that allows both the training and execution of a recurrent SNN. The ReckON architecture, implemented on a custom ASIC, can be fully described using a hardware description language. In this work, we adapt the Verilog description to implement it on a Xilinx Multiprocessor System on Chip system (MPSoC). We present the circuits required for the efficient operation of the system, and a Python framework to use it on the Pynq ZU platform. We validate the architecture and implementation in two different scenarios, and show how the simulated accuracy is preserved with a peak performance of 3.8M events processed per second.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Attentive Graph Networks to Simulate Physical Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning to represent and simulate the dynamics of physical systems is a crucial yet challenging task. Existing equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) based methods have encapsulated the symmetry of physics, \emph{e.g.}, translations, rotations, etc, leading to better generalization ability. Nevertheless, their frame-to-frame formulation of the task overlooks the non-Markov property mainly incurred by unobserved dynamics in the environment. In this paper, we reformulate dynamics simulation as a spatio-temporal prediction task, by employing the trajectory in the past period to recover the Non-Markovian interactions. We propose Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Attentive Graph Networks (ESTAG), an equivariant version of spatio-temporal GNNs, to fulfill our purpose. At its core, we design a novel Equivariant Discrete Fourier Transform (EDFT) to extract periodic patterns from the history frames, and then construct an Equivariant Spatial Module (ESM) to accomplish spatial message passing, and an Equivariant Temporal Module (ETM) with the forward attention and equivariant pooling mechanisms to aggregate temporal message. We evaluate our model on three real datasets corresponding to the molecular-, protein- and macro-level. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of ESTAG compared to typical spatio-temporal GNNs and equivariant GNNs.</description>

      <title>Explaining Expert Search and Team Formation Systems with ExES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expert search and team formation systems operate on collaboration networks, with nodes representing individuals, labeled with their skills, and edges denoting collaboration relationships. Given a keyword query corresponding to the desired skills, these systems identify experts that best match the query. However, state-of-the-art solutions to this problem lack transparency. To address this issue, we propose ExES, a tool designed to explain expert search and team formation systems using factual and counterfactual methods from the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). ExES uses factual explanations to highlight important skills and collaborations, and counterfactual explanations to suggest new skills and collaborations to increase the likelihood of being identified as an expert. Towards a practical deployment as an interactive explanation tool, we present and experimentally evaluate a suite of pruning strategies to speed up the explanation search. In many cases, our pruning strategies make ExES an order of magnitude faster than exhaustive search, while still producing concise and actionable explanations.</description>

      <title>Investigating Persuasion Techniques in Arabic: An Empirical Study Leveraging Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current era of digital communication and widespread use of social media, it is crucial to develop an understanding of persuasive techniques employed in written text. This knowledge is essential for effectively discerning accurate information and making informed decisions. To address this need, this paper presents a comprehensive empirical study focused on identifying persuasive techniques in Arabic social media content. To achieve this objective, we utilize Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and leverage the ArAlEval dataset, which encompasses two tasks: binary classification to determine the presence or absence of persuasion techniques, and multi-label classification to identify the specific types of techniques employed in the text. Our study explores three different learning approaches by harnessing the power of PLMs: feature extraction, fine-tuning, and prompt engineering techniques. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the fine-tuning approach yields the highest results on the aforementioned dataset, achieving an f1-micro score of 0.865 and an f1-weighted score of 0.861. Furthermore, our analysis sheds light on an interesting finding. While the performance of the GPT model is relatively lower compared to the other approaches, we have observed that by employing few-shot learning techniques, we can enhance its results by up to 20\%. This offers promising directions for future research and exploration in this topic\footnote{Upon Acceptance, the source code will be released on GitHub.}.</description>

      <title>Adversarial DPO: Harnessing Harmful Data for Reducing Toxicity with Minimal Impact on Coherence and Evasiveness in Dialogue Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in open-domain dialogue systems have been propelled by the emergence of high-quality large language models (LLMs) and various effective training methodologies. Nevertheless, the presence of toxicity within these models presents a significant challenge that can potentially diminish the user experience. In this study, we introduce an innovative training algorithm, an improvement upon direct preference optimization (DPO), called adversarial DPO (ADPO). The ADPO algorithm is designed to train models to assign higher probability distributions to preferred responses and lower distributions to unsafe responses, which are self-generated using the toxic control token. We demonstrate that ADPO enhances the model's resilience against harmful conversations while minimizing performance degradation. Furthermore, we illustrate that ADPO offers a more stable training procedure compared to the traditional DPO. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first adaptation of the DPO algorithm that directly incorporates harmful data into the generative model, thereby reducing the need to artificially create safe dialogue data.</description>

      <title>Topic Modelling Case Law Using a Large Language Model and a New Taxonomy for UK Law: AI Insights into Summary Judgment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a critical gap in legal analytics by developing and applying a novel taxonomy for topic modelling summary judgment cases in the United Kingdom. Using a curated dataset of summary judgment cases, we use the Large Language Model Claude 3 Opus to explore functional topics and trends. We find that Claude 3 Opus correctly classified the topic with an accuracy of 87.10%. The analysis reveals distinct patterns in the application of summary judgments across various legal domains. As case law in the United Kingdom is not originally labelled with keywords or a topic filtering option, the findings not only refine our understanding of the thematic underpinnings of summary judgments but also illustrate the potential of combining traditional and AI-driven approaches in legal classification. Therefore, this paper provides a new and general taxonomy for UK law. The implications of this work serve as a foundation for further research and policy discussions in the field of judicial administration and computational legal research methodologies.</description>

      <title>Panmodal Information Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is transforming information interaction. For decades, search engines such as Google and Bing have been the primary means of locating relevant information for the general population. They have provided search results in the same standard format (the so-called "10 blue links"). The recent ability to chat via natural language with AI-based agents and have GenAI automatically synthesize answers in real-time (grounded in top-ranked results) is changing how people interact with and consume information at massive scale. These two information interaction modalities (traditional search and AI-powered chat) coexist in current search engines, either loosely coupled (e.g., as separate options/tabs) or tightly coupled (e.g., integrated as a chat answer embedded directly within a traditional search result page). We believe that the existence of these two different modalities, and potentially many others, is creating an opportunity to re-imagine the search experience, capitalize on the strengths of many modalities, and develop systems and strategies to support seamless flow between them. We refer to these as panmodal experiences. Unlike monomodal experiences, where only one modality is available and/or used for the task at hand, panmodal experiences make multiple modalities available to users (multimodal), directly support transitions between modalities (crossmodal), and seamlessly combine modalities to tailor task assistance (transmodal). While our focus is search and chat, with learnings from insights from a survey of over 100 individuals who have recently performed common tasks on these two modalities, we also present a more general vision for the future of information interaction using multiple modalities and the emergent capabilities of GenAI.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in tasks such as summarization, arithmetic reasoning, and question answering. However, they encounter significant challenges in the domain of moral reasoning and ethical decision-making, especially in complex scenarios with multiple stakeholders. This paper introduces the Skin-in-the-Game (SKIG) framework, aimed at enhancing moral reasoning in LLMs by exploring decisions' consequences from multiple stakeholder perspectives. Central to SKIG's mechanism is simulating accountability for actions, which, alongside empathy exercises and risk assessment, is pivotal to its effectiveness. We validate SKIG's performance across various moral reasoning benchmarks with proprietary and opensource LLMs, and investigate its crucial components through extensive ablation analyses.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of enhancing cybersecurity in Blockchain-based Internet of Things (BIoTs) systems, which are increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated cyberattacks. It introduces an AI-powered system model for the dynamic deployment of honeypots, utilizing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) integrated with smart contract functionalities on IoT nodes. This model enables the transformation of regular nodes into decoys in response to suspicious activities, thereby strengthening the security of BIoT networks. The paper analyses strategic interactions between potential attackers and the AI-enhanced IDS through a game-theoretic model, specifically Bayesian games. The model focuses on understanding and predicting sophisticated attacks that may initially appear normal, emphasizing strategic decision-making, optimized honeypot deployment, and adaptive strategies in response to evolving attack patterns.</description>

      <title>A Method on Searching Better Activation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of artificial neural networks (ANNs) hinges greatly on the judicious selection of an activation function, introducing non-linearity into network and enabling them to model sophisticated relationships in data. However, the search of activation functions has largely relied on empirical knowledge in the past, lacking theoretical guidance, which has hindered the identification of more effective activation functions. In this work, we offer a proper solution to such issue. Firstly, we theoretically demonstrate the existence of the worst activation function with boundary conditions (WAFBC) from the perspective of information entropy. Furthermore, inspired by the Taylor expansion form of information entropy functional, we propose the Entropy-based Activation Function Optimization (EAFO) methodology. EAFO methodology presents a novel perspective for designing static activation functions in deep neural networks and the potential of dynamically optimizing activation during iterative training. Utilizing EAFO methodology, we derive a novel activation function from ReLU, known as Correction Regularized ReLU (CRReLU). Experiments conducted with vision transformer and its variants on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate the superiority of CRReLU over existing corrections of ReLU. Extensive empirical studies on task of large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, CRReLU exhibits superior performance compared to GELU, suggesting its broader potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Energy Rank Alignment: Using Preference Optimization to Search Chemical Space at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searching through chemical space is an exceptionally challenging problem because the number of possible molecules grows combinatorially with the number of atoms. Large, autoregressive models trained on databases of chemical compounds have yielded powerful generators, but we still lack robust strategies for generating molecules with desired properties. This molecular search problem closely resembles the "alignment" problem for large language models, though for many chemical tasks we have a specific and easily evaluable reward function. Here, we introduce an algorithm called energy rank alignment (ERA) that leverages an explicit reward function to produce a gradient-based objective that we use to optimize autoregressive policies. We show theoretically that this algorithm is closely related to proximal policy optimization (PPO) and direct preference optimization (DPO), but has a minimizer that converges to an ideal Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution with the reward playing the role of an energy function. Furthermore, this algorithm is highly scalable, does not require reinforcement learning, and performs well relative to DPO when the number of preference observations per pairing is small. We deploy this approach to align molecular transformers to generate molecules with externally specified properties and find that it does so robustly, searching through diverse parts of chemical space. While our focus here is on chemical search, we also obtain excellent results on an AI supervised task for LLM alignment, showing that the method is scalable and general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of artificial intelligence has led to a growing emphasis on data-driven modeling in macroeconomics, with agent-based modeling (ABM) emerging as a prominent bottom-up simulation paradigm. In ABM, agents (e.g., households, firms) interact within a macroeconomic environment, collectively generating market dynamics. Existing agent modeling typically employs predetermined rules or learning-based neural networks for decision-making. However, customizing each agent presents significant challenges, complicating the modeling of agent heterogeneity. Additionally, the influence of multi-period market dynamics and multifaceted macroeconomic factors are often overlooked in decision-making processes. In this work, we introduce EconAgent, a large language model-empowered agent with human-like characteristics for macroeconomic simulation. We first construct a simulation environment that incorporates various market dynamics driven by agents' decisions regarding work and consumption. Through the perception module, we create heterogeneous agents with distinct decision-making mechanisms. Furthermore, we model the impact of macroeconomic trends using a memory module, which allows agents to reflect on past individual experiences and market dynamics. Simulation experiments show that EconAgent can make realistic decisions, leading to more reasonable macroeconomic phenomena compared to existing rule-based or learning-based agents. Our codes are released at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/ACL24-EconAgent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strategies for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) typically require memory. One way to represent this memory is via automata. We present a method to learn an automaton representation of a strategy using a modification of the L*-algorithm. Compared to the tabular representation of a strategy, the resulting automaton is dramatically smaller and thus also more explainable. Moreover, in the learning process, our heuristics may even improve the strategy's performance. In contrast to approaches that synthesize an automaton directly from the POMDP thereby solving it, our approach is incomparably more scalable.</description>

Abstract: Preference datasets are essential for incorporating human preferences into pre-trained language models, playing a key role in the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. However, these datasets often demonstrate conflicting alignment objectives, leading to increased vulnerability to jailbreak attacks and challenges in adapting downstream tasks to prioritize specific alignment objectives without negatively impacting others. In this work, we introduce a novel statistical metric, Alignment Dimension Conflict, to quantify the degree of conflict within preference datasets. We then present \texttt{Hummer} and its fine-grained variant, \texttt{Hummer-F}, as innovative pairwise preference datasets with reduced-conflict alignment objectives. \texttt{Hummer} is built based on UltraFeedback and is enhanced by AI feedback from GPT-4, marking as the first preference dataset aimed at reducing the competition between alignment objectives. Furthermore, we develop reward models, HummerRM and HummerRM-F, which employ a hybrid sampling approach to balance diverse alignment objectives effectively. This sampling method positions HummerRM as an ideal model for domain-specific further fine-tuning and reducing vulnerabilities to attacks.</description>

      <title>Learning from One and Only One Shot</title>

Abstract: Humans can generalize from only a few examples and from little pretraining on similar tasks. Yet, machine learning (ML) typically requires large data to learn or pre-learn to transfer. Motivated by nativism and artificial general intelligence, we directly model human-innate priors in abstract visual tasks such as character and doodle recognition. This yields a white-box model that learns general-appearance similarity by mimicking how humans naturally ``distort'' an object at first sight. Using just nearest-neighbor classification on this cognitively-inspired similarity space, we achieve human-level recognition with only $1$--$10$ examples per class and no pretraining. This differs from few-shot learning that uses massive pretraining. In the tiny-data regime of MNIST, EMNIST, Omniglot, and QuickDraw benchmarks, we outperform both modern neural networks and classical ML. For unsupervised learning, by learning the non-Euclidean, general-appearance similarity space in a $k$-means style, we achieve multifarious visual realizations of abstract concepts by generating human-intuitive archetypes as cluster centroids.</description>

      <title>GRACE-C: Generalized Rate Agnostic Causal Estimation via Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.09235v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphical structures estimated by causal learning algorithms from time series data can provide misleading causal information if the causal timescale of the generating process fails to match the measurement timescale of the data. Existing algorithms provide limited resources to respond to this challenge, and so researchers must either use models that they know are likely misleading, or else forego causal learning entirely. Existing methods face up-to-four distinct shortfalls, as they might 1) require that the difference between causal and measurement timescales is known; 2) only handle very small number of random variables when the timescale difference is unknown; 3) only apply to pairs of variables; or 4) be unable to find a solution given statistical noise in the data. This research addresses these challenges. Our approach combines constraint programming with both theoretical insights into the problem structure and prior information about admissible causal interactions to achieve multiple orders of magnitude in speed-up. The resulting system maintains theoretical guarantees while scaling to significantly larger sets of random variables (&gt;100) without knowledge of timescale differences. This method is also robust to edge misidentification and can use parametric connection strengths, while optionally finding the optimal solution among many possible ones.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Prototype-Enhanced Network for Few-Shot Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04873v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current methods for few-shot action recognition mainly fall into the metric learning framework following ProtoNet, which demonstrates the importance of prototypes. Although they achieve relatively good performance, the effect of multimodal information is ignored, e.g. label texts. In this work, we propose a novel MultimOdal PRototype-ENhanced Network (MORN), which uses the semantic information of label texts as multimodal information to enhance prototypes. A CLIP visual encoder and a frozen CLIP text encoder are introduced to obtain features with good multimodal initialization. Then in the visual flow, visual prototypes are computed by a visual prototype-computed module. In the text flow, a semantic-enhanced (SE) module and an inflating operation are used to obtain text prototypes. The final multimodal prototypes are then computed by a multimodal prototype-enhanced (MPE) module. Besides, we define a PRototype SImilarity DiffErence (PRIDE) to evaluate the quality of prototypes, which is used to verify our improvement on the prototype level and effectiveness of MORN. We conduct extensive experiments on four popular few-shot action recognition datasets: HMDB51, UCF101, Kinetics and SSv2, and MORN achieves state-of-the-art results. When plugging PRIDE into the training stage, the performance can be further improved.</description>

      <title>t-SMILES: A Scalable Fragment-based Molecular Representation Framework for De Novo Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01829v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective representation of molecules is a crucial factor affecting the performance of artificial intelligence models. This study introduces a flexible, fragment-based, multiscale molecular representation framework called t-SMILES (tree-based SMILES) with three code algorithms: TSSA, TSDY and TSID. It describes molecules using SMILES-type strings obtained by performing a breadth-first search on a full binary tree formed from a fragmented molecular graph. Systematic evaluations using JTVAE, BRICS, MMPA, and Scaffold show the feasibility of constructing a multi-code molecular description system, where various descriptions complement each other, enhancing the overall performance. In addition, it can avoid overfitting and achieve higher novelty scores while maintaining reasonable similarity on labeled low-resource datasets, regardless of whether the model is original, data-augmented, or pre-trained then fine-tuned. Furthermore, it significantly outperforms classical SMILES, DeepSMILES, SELFIES and baseline models in goal-directed tasks. And it surpasses state-of-the-art fragment, graph and SMILES based approaches on ChEMBL, Zinc, and QM9.</description>

      <title>Parents and Children: Distinguishing Multimodal DeepFakes from Natural Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled the generation of realistic deepfakes from textual prompts in natural language. While these models have numerous benefits across various sectors, they have also raised concerns about the potential misuse of fake images and cast new pressures on fake image detection. In this work, we pioneer a systematic study on deepfake detection generated by state-of-the-art diffusion models. Firstly, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the performance of contrastive and classification-based visual features, respectively extracted from CLIP-based models and ResNet or ViT-based architectures trained on image classification datasets. Our results demonstrate that fake images share common low-level cues, which render them easily recognizable. Further, we devise a multimodal setting wherein fake images are synthesized by different textual captions, which are used as seeds for a generator. Under this setting, we quantify the performance of fake detection strategies and introduce a contrastive-based disentangling method that lets us analyze the role of the semantics of textual descriptions and low-level perceptual cues. Finally, we release a new dataset, called COCOFake, containing about 1.2M images generated from the original COCO image-caption pairs using two recent text-to-image diffusion models, namely Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2.0.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Episode Generation for Graph Meta-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15217v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Unsupervised Episode Generation method called Neighbors as Queries (NaQ) to solve the Few-Shot Node-Classification (FSNC) task by unsupervised Graph Meta-learning. Doing so enables full utilization of the information of all nodes in a graph, which is not possible in current supervised meta-learning methods for FSNC due to the label-scarcity problem. In addition, unlike unsupervised Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) methods that overlook the downstream task to be solved at the training phase resulting in vulnerability to class imbalance of a graph, we adopt the episodic learning framework that allows the model to be aware of the downstream task format, i.e., FSNC. The proposed NaQ is a simple but effective unsupervised episode generation method that randomly samples nodes from a graph to make a support set, followed by similarity-based sampling of nodes to make the corresponding query set. Since NaQ is model-agnostic, any existing supervised graph meta-learning methods can be trained in an unsupervised manner, while not sacrificing much of their performance or sometimes even improving them. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed unsupervised episode generation method for graph meta-learning towards the FSNC task. Our code is available at: https://github.com/JhngJng/NaQ-PyTorch.</description>

      <title>Offline Reinforcement Learning with Imbalanced Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prevalent use of benchmarks in current offline reinforcement learning (RL) research has led to a neglect of the imbalance of real-world dataset distributions in the development of models. The real-world offline RL dataset is often imbalanced over the state space due to the challenge of exploration or safety considerations. In this paper, we specify properties of imbalanced datasets in offline RL, where the state coverage follows a power law distribution characterized by skewed policies. Theoretically and empirically, we show that typically offline RL methods based on distributional constraints, such as conservative Q-learning (CQL), are ineffective in extracting policies under the imbalanced dataset. Inspired by natural intelligence, we propose a novel offline RL method that utilizes the augmentation of CQL with a retrieval process to recall past related experiences, effectively alleviating the challenges posed by imbalanced datasets. We evaluate our method on several tasks in the context of imbalanced datasets with varying levels of imbalance, utilizing the variant of D4RL. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our method over other baselines.</description>

      <title>Budgeting Counterfactual for Offline RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main challenge of offline reinforcement learning, where data is limited, arises from a sequence of counterfactual reasoning dilemmas within the realm of potential actions: What if we were to choose a different course of action? These circumstances frequently give rise to extrapolation errors, which tend to accumulate exponentially with the problem horizon. Hence, it becomes crucial to acknowledge that not all decision steps are equally important to the final outcome, and to budget the number of counterfactual decisions a policy make in order to control the extrapolation. Contrary to existing approaches that use regularization on either the policy or value function, we propose an approach to explicitly bound the amount of out-of-distribution actions during training. Specifically, our method utilizes dynamic programming to decide where to extrapolate and where not to, with an upper bound on the decisions different from behavior policy. It balances between the potential for improvement from taking out-of-distribution actions and the risk of making errors due to extrapolation. Theoretically, we justify our method by the constrained optimality of the fixed point solution to our $Q$ updating rules. Empirically, we show that the overall performance of our method is better than the state-of-the-art offline RL methods on tasks in the widely-used D4RL benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Recklessness to Collaborative Filtering based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02058v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems are intrinsically tied to a reliability/coverage dilemma: The more reliable we desire the forecasts, the more conservative the decision will be and thus, the fewer items will be recommended. This causes a detriment to the predictive capability of the system, as it is only able to estimate potential interest in items for which there is a consensus in their evaluation, rather than being able to estimate potential interest in any item. In this paper, we propose the inclusion of a new term in the learning process of matrix factorization-based recommender systems, called recklessness, that takes into account the variance of the output probability distribution of the predicted ratings. In this way, gauging this recklessness measure we can force more spiky output distribution, enabling the control of the risk level desired when making decisions about the reliability of a prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that recklessness not only allows for risk regulation but also improves the quantity and quality of predictions provided by the recommender system.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Cranial Defect Reconstruction by Iterative, Low-Resolution, Point Cloud Completion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Each year thousands of people suffer from various types of cranial injuries and require personalized implants whose manual design is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, an automatic, dedicated system to increase the availability of personalized cranial reconstruction is highly desirable. The problem of the automatic cranial defect reconstruction can be formulated as the shape completion task and solved using dedicated deep networks. Currently, the most common approach is to use the volumetric representation and apply deep networks dedicated to image segmentation. However, this approach has several limitations and does not scale well into high-resolution volumes, nor takes into account the data sparsity. In our work, we reformulate the problem into a point cloud completion task. We propose an iterative, transformer-based method to reconstruct the cranial defect at any resolution while also being fast and resource-efficient during training and inference. We compare the proposed methods to the state-of-the-art volumetric approaches and show superior performance in terms of GPU memory consumption while maintaining high-quality of the reconstructed defects.</description>

      <title>BioCoder: A Benchmark for Bioinformatics Code Generation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16458v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved code generation. As these models scale up, there is an increasing need for the output to handle more intricate tasks and to be appropriately specialized to particular domains. Here, we target bioinformatics due to the amount of domain knowledge, algorithms, and data operations this discipline requires. We present BioCoder, a benchmark developed to evaluate LLMs in generating bioinformatics-specific code. BioCoder spans much of the field, covering cross-file dependencies, class declarations, and global variables. It incorporates 1,026 Python functions and 1,243 Java methods extracted from GitHub, along with 253 examples from the Rosalind Project, all pertaining to bioinformatics. Using topic modeling, we show that the overall coverage of the included code is representative of the full spectrum of bioinformatics calculations. BioCoder incorporates a fuzz-testing framework for evaluation. We have applied it to evaluate various models including InCoder, CodeGen, CodeGen2, SantaCoder, StarCoder, StarCoder+, InstructCodeT5+, GPT-3.5, and GPT- 4. Furthermore, we fine-tuned one model (StarCoder), demonstrating that our training dataset can enhance the performance on our testing benchmark (by &gt;15% in terms of Pass@K under certain prompt configurations and always &gt;3%). The results highlight two key aspects of successful models: (1) Successful models accommodate a long prompt (&gt; 2,600 tokens) with full context, including functional dependencies. (2) They contain domain-specific knowledge of bioinformatics, beyond just general coding capability. This is evident from the performance gain of GPT-3.5/4 compared to the smaller models on our benchmark (50% vs. up to 25%). Availability and implementation: Code is available at: https://github.com/gersteinlab/biocoder and https://biocoder-benchmark. github.io/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to performing fitness approximation in genetic algorithms (GAs) using machine-learning (ML) models, through dynamic adaptation to the evolutionary state. Maintaining a dataset of sampled individuals along with their actual fitness scores, we continually update a fitness-approximation ML model throughout an evolutionary run. We compare different methods for: 1) switching between actual and approximate fitness, 2) sampling the population, and 3) weighting the samples. Experimental findings demonstrate significant improvement in evolutionary runtimes, with fitness scores that are either identical or slightly lower than that of the fully run GA -- depending on the ratio of approximate-to-actual-fitness computation. Although we focus on evolutionary agents in Gymnasium (game) simulators -- where fitness computation is costly -- our approach is generic and can be easily applied to many different domains.</description>

      <title>FedLPA: One-shot Federated Learning with Layer-Wise Posterior Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently aggregating trained neural networks from local clients into a global model on a server is a widely researched topic in federated learning. Recently, motivated by diminishing privacy concerns, mitigating potential attacks, and reducing communication overhead, one-shot federated learning (i.e., limiting client-server communication into a single round) has gained popularity among researchers. However, the one-shot aggregation performances are sensitively affected by the non-identical training data distribution, which exhibits high statistical heterogeneity in some real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel one-shot aggregation method with layer-wise posterior aggregation, named FedLPA. FedLPA aggregates local models to obtain a more accurate global model without requiring extra auxiliary datasets or exposing any private label information, e.g., label distributions. To effectively capture the statistics maintained in the biased local datasets in the practical non-IID scenario, we efficiently infer the posteriors of each layer in each local model using layer-wise Laplace approximation and aggregate them to train the global parameters. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FedLPA significantly improves learning performance over state-of-the-art methods across several metrics.</description>

      <title>Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning by Mutual Information Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), ensuring robustness against unpredictable or worst-case actions by allies is crucial for real-world deployment. Existing robust MARL methods either approximate or enumerate all possible threat scenarios against worst-case adversaries, leading to computational intensity and reduced robustness. In contrast, human learning efficiently acquires robust behaviors in daily life without preparing for every possible threat. Inspired by this, we frame robust MARL as an inference problem, with worst-case robustness implicitly optimized under all threat scenarios via off-policy evaluation. Within this framework, we demonstrate that Mutual Information Regularization as Robust Regularization (MIR3) during routine training is guaranteed to maximize a lower bound on robustness, without the need for adversaries. Further insights show that MIR3 acts as an information bottleneck, preventing agents from over-reacting to others and aligning policies with robust action priors. In the presence of worst-case adversaries, our MIR3 significantly surpasses baseline methods in robustness and training efficiency while maintaining cooperative performance in StarCraft II and robot swarm control. When deploying the robot swarm control algorithm in the real world, our method also outperforms the best baseline by 14.29%.</description>

      <title>A Uniform Language to Explain Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formal XAI community has studied a plethora of interpretability queries aiming to understand the classifications made by decision trees. However, a more uniform understanding of what questions we can hope to answer about these models, traditionally deemed to be easily interpretable, has remained elusive. In an initial attempt to understand uniform languages for interpretability, Arenas et al. (2021) proposed FOIL, a logic for explaining black-box ML models, and showed that it can express a variety of interpretability queries. However, we show that FOIL is limited in two important senses: (i) it is not expressive enough to capture some crucial queries, and (ii) its model agnostic nature results in a high computational complexity for decision trees. In this paper, we carefully craft two fragments of first-order logic that allow for efficiently interpreting decision trees: Q-DT-FOIL and its optimization variant OPT-DT-FOIL. We show that our proposed logics can express not only a variety of interpretability queries considered by previous literature, but also elegantly allows users to specify different objectives the sought explanations should optimize for. Using finite model-theoretic techniques, we show that the different ingredients of Q-DT-FOIL are necessary for its expressiveness, and yet that queries in Q-DT-FOIL can be evaluated with a polynomial number of queries to a SAT solver, as well as their optimization versions in OPT-DT-FOIL. Besides our theoretical results, we provide a SAT-based implementation of the evaluation for OPT-DT-FOIL that is performant on industry-size decision trees.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit synthesis with diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has recently emerged as a transformative technology. Yet, its promised advantages rely on efficiently translating quantum operations into viable physical realizations. In this work, we use generative machine learning models, specifically denoising diffusion models (DMs), to facilitate this transformation. Leveraging text-conditioning, we steer the model to produce desired quantum operations within gate-based quantum circuits. Notably, DMs allow to sidestep during training the exponential overhead inherent in the classical simulation of quantum dynamics -- a consistent bottleneck in preceding ML techniques. We demonstrate the model's capabilities across two tasks: entanglement generation and unitary compilation. The model excels at generating new circuits and supports typical DM extensions such as masking and editing to, for instance, align the circuit generation to the constraints of the targeted quantum device. Given their flexibility and generalization abilities, we envision DMs as pivotal in quantum circuit synthesis, enhancing both practical applications but also insights into theoretical quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Flames: Benchmarking Value Alignment of LLMs in Chinese</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06899v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) across various regions underscores the urgent need to evaluate their alignment with human values. Current benchmarks, however, fall short of effectively uncovering safety vulnerabilities in LLMs. Despite numerous models achieving high scores and 'topping the chart' in these evaluations, there is still a significant gap in LLMs' deeper alignment with human values and achieving genuine harmlessness. To this end, this paper proposes a value alignment benchmark named Flames, which encompasses both common harmlessness principles and a unique morality dimension that integrates specific Chinese values such as harmony. Accordingly, we carefully design adversarial prompts that incorporate complex scenarios and jailbreaking methods, mostly with implicit malice. By prompting 17 mainstream LLMs, we obtain model responses and rigorously annotate them for detailed evaluation. Our findings indicate that all the evaluated LLMs demonstrate relatively poor performance on Flames, particularly in the safety and fairness dimensions. We also develop a lightweight specified scorer capable of scoring LLMs across multiple dimensions to efficiently evaluate new models on the benchmark. The complexity of Flames has far exceeded existing benchmarks, setting a new challenge for contemporary LLMs and highlighting the need for further alignment of LLMs. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/AIFlames/Flames.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Model Predictive Control for Highway Ramp Metering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the backdrop of an increasingly pressing need for effective urban and highway transportation systems, this work explores the synergy between model-based and learning-based strategies to enhance traffic flow management by use of an innovative approach to the problem of ramp metering control that embeds Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques within the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework. The control problem is formulated as an RL task by crafting a suitable stage cost function that is representative of the traffic conditions, variability in the control action, and violations of the constraint on the maximum number of vehicles in queue. An MPC-based RL approach, which leverages the MPC optimal problem as a function approximation for the RL algorithm, is proposed to learn to efficiently control an on-ramp and satisfy its constraints despite uncertainties in the system model and variable demands. Simulations are performed on a benchmark small-scale highway network to compare the proposed methodology against other state-of-the-art control approaches. Results show that, starting from an MPC controller that has an imprecise model and is poorly tuned, the proposed methodology is able to effectively learn to improve the control policy such that congestion in the network is reduced and constraints are satisfied, yielding an improved performance that is superior to the other controllers.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Potential Impacts of Papers into Diffusion, Conformity, and Contribution Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The potential impact of an academic paper is determined by various factors, including its popularity and contribution. Existing models usually estimate original citation counts based on static graphs and fail to differentiate values from nuanced perspectives. In this study, we propose a novel graph neural network to Disentangle the Potential impacts of Papers into Diffusion, Conformity, and Contribution values (called DPPDCC). Given a target paper, DPPDCC encodes temporal and structural features within the constructed dynamic heterogeneous graph. Particularly, to capture the knowledge flow, we emphasize the importance of comparative and co-cited/citing information between papers and aggregate snapshots evolutionarily. To unravel popularity, we contrast augmented graphs to extract the essence of diffusion and predict the accumulated citation binning to model conformity. We further apply orthogonal constraints to encourage distinct modeling of each perspective and preserve the inherent value of contribution. To evaluate models' generalization for papers published at various times, we reformulate the problem by partitioning data based on specific time points to mirror real-world conditions. Extensive experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that DPPDCC significantly outperforms baselines for previously, freshly, and immediately published papers. Further analyses confirm its robust capabilities. We will make our datasets and codes publicly available.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Fairness Generalization under Covariate and Dependence Shifts Simultaneously</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The endeavor to preserve the generalization of a fair and invariant classifier across domains, especially in the presence of distribution shifts, becomes a significant and intricate challenge in machine learning. In response to this challenge, numerous effective algorithms have been developed with a focus on addressing the problem of fairness-aware domain generalization. These algorithms are designed to navigate various types of distribution shifts, with a particular emphasis on covariate and dependence shifts. In this context, covariate shift pertains to changes in the marginal distribution of input features, while dependence shift involves alterations in the joint distribution of the label variable and sensitive attributes. In this paper, we introduce a simple but effective approach that aims to learn a fair and invariant classifier by simultaneously addressing both covariate and dependence shifts across domains. We assert the existence of an underlying transformation model can transform data from one domain to another, while preserving the semantics related to non-sensitive attributes and classes. By augmenting various synthetic data domains through the model, we learn a fair and invariant classifier in source domains. This classifier can then be generalized to unknown target domains, maintaining both model prediction and fairness concerns. Extensive empirical studies on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Demand response for residential building heating: Effective Monte Carlo Tree Search control based on physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03365v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To reduce global carbon emissions and limit climate change, controlling energy consumption in buildings is an important piece of the puzzle. Here, we specifically focus on using a demand response (DR) algorithm to limit the energy consumption of a residential building's heating system while respecting user's thermal comfort. In that domain, Reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been shown to be quite effective. One such RL method is Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which has achieved impressive success in playing board games (go, chess). A particular advantage of MCTS is that its decision tree structure naturally allows to integrate exogenous constraints (e.g., by trimming branches that violate them), while conventional RL solutions need more elaborate techniques (e.g., indirectly by adding penalties in the cost/reward function, or through a backup controller that corrects constraint-violating actions). The main aim of this paper is to study the adoption of MCTS for building control, since this (to the best of our knowledge) has remained largely unexplored. A specific property of MCTS is that it needs a simulator component that can predict subsequent system states, based on actions taken. A straightforward data-driven solution is to use black-box neural networks (NNs). We will however extend a Physics-informed Neural Network (PiNN) model to deliver multi-timestep predictions, and show the benefit it offers in terms of lower prediction errors ($-$32\% MAE) as well as better MCTS performance ($-$4\% energy cost, $+$7\% thermal comfort) compared to a black-box NN. A second contribution will be to extend a vanilla MCTS version to adopt the ideas applied in AlphaZero (i.e., using learned prior and value functions and an action selection heuristic) to obtain lower computational costs while maintaining control performance.</description>

      <title>Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11805v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report introduces a new family of multimodal models, Gemini, that exhibit remarkable capabilities across image, audio, video, and text understanding. The Gemini family consists of Ultra, Pro, and Nano sizes, suitable for applications ranging from complex reasoning tasks to on-device memory-constrained use-cases. Evaluation on a broad range of benchmarks shows that our most-capable Gemini Ultra model advances the state of the art in 30 of 32 of these benchmarks - notably being the first model to achieve human-expert performance on the well-studied exam benchmark MMLU, and improving the state of the art in every one of the 20 multimodal benchmarks we examined. We believe that the new capabilities of the Gemini family in cross-modal reasoning and language understanding will enable a wide variety of use cases. We discuss our approach toward post-training and deploying Gemini models responsibly to users through services including Gemini, Gemini Advanced, Google AI Studio, and Cloud Vertex AI.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Instruction Tuning With Just a Pinch of Multilinguality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01854v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) gain global adoption, their ability to follow instructions in multiple languages becomes increasingly crucial. In this work, we investigate how multilinguality during instruction tuning of a multilingual LLM affects instruction-following across languages from the pre-training corpus. We first show that many languages transfer some instruction-following capabilities to other languages from even monolingual tuning. Furthermore, we find that only 40 multilingual examples integrated in an English tuning set substantially improve multilingual instruction-following, both in seen and unseen languages during tuning. In general, we observe that models tuned on multilingual mixtures exhibit comparable or superior performance in multiple languages compared to monolingually tuned models, despite training on 10x fewer examples in those languages. Finally, we find that diversifying the instruction tuning set with even just 2-4 languages significantly improves cross-lingual generalization. Our results suggest that building massively multilingual instruction-tuned models can be done with only a very small set of multilingual instruction-responses.</description>

      <title>Agile But Safe: Learning Collision-Free High-Speed Legged Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Legged robots navigating cluttered environments must be jointly agile for efficient task execution and safe to avoid collisions with obstacles or humans. Existing studies either develop conservative controllers (&lt; 1.0 m/s) to ensure safety, or focus on agility without considering potentially fatal collisions. This paper introduces Agile But Safe (ABS), a learning-based control framework that enables agile and collision-free locomotion for quadrupedal robots. ABS involves an agile policy to execute agile motor skills amidst obstacles and a recovery policy to prevent failures, collaboratively achieving high-speed and collision-free navigation. The policy switch in ABS is governed by a learned control-theoretic reach-avoid value network, which also guides the recovery policy as an objective function, thereby safeguarding the robot in a closed loop. The training process involves the learning of the agile policy, the reach-avoid value network, the recovery policy, and an exteroception representation network, all in simulation. These trained modules can be directly deployed in the real world with onboard sensing and computation, leading to high-speed and collision-free navigation in confined indoor and outdoor spaces with both static and dynamic obstacles.</description>

      <title>On Prompt-Driven Safeguarding for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18018v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prepending model inputs with safety prompts is a common practice for safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against queries with harmful intents. However, the underlying working mechanisms of safety prompts have not been unraveled yet, restricting the possibility of automatically optimizing them to improve LLM safety. In this work, we investigate how LLMs' behavior (i.e., complying with or refusing user queries) is affected by safety prompts from the perspective of model representation. We find that in the representation space, the input queries are typically moved by safety prompts in a "higher-refusal" direction, in which models become more prone to refusing to provide assistance, even when the queries are harmless. On the other hand, LLMs are naturally capable of distinguishing harmful and harmless queries without safety prompts. Inspired by these findings, we propose a method for safety prompt optimization, namely DRO (Directed Representation Optimization). Treating a safety prompt as continuous, trainable embeddings, DRO learns to move the queries' representations along or opposite the refusal direction, depending on their harmfulness. Experiments with eight LLMs on out-of-domain and jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that DRO remarkably improves the safeguarding performance of human-crafted safety prompts, without compromising the models' general performance.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Capabilities of LLMs for Supporting Anticipatory Impact Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaining insight into the potential negative impacts of emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in society is a challenge for implementing anticipatory governance approaches. One approach to produce such insight is to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to support and guide experts in the process of ideating and exploring the range of undesirable consequences of emerging technologies. However, performance evaluations of LLMs for such tasks are still needed, including examining the general quality of generated impacts but also the range of types of impacts produced and resulting biases. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential for generating high-quality and diverse impacts of AI in society by fine-tuning completion models (GPT-3 and Mistral-7B) on a diverse sample of articles from news media and comparing those outputs to the impacts generated by instruction-based (GPT-4 and Mistral-7B-Instruct) models. We examine the generated impacts for coherence, structure, relevance, and plausibility and find that the generated impacts using Mistral-7B, a small open-source model fine-tuned on impacts from the news media, tend to be qualitatively on par with impacts generated using a more capable and larger scale model such as GPT-4. Moreover, we find that impacts produced by instruction-based models had gaps in the production of certain categories of impacts in comparison to fine-tuned models. This research highlights a potential bias in the range of impacts generated by state-of-the-art LLMs and the potential of aligning smaller LLMs on news media as a scalable alternative to generate high quality and more diverse impacts in support of anticipatory governance approaches.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Understand Molecules?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) from OpenAI and LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) from Meta AI are increasingly recognized for their potential in the field of cheminformatics, particularly in understanding Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES), a standard method for representing chemical structures. These LLMs also have the ability to decode SMILES strings into vector representations.
  Method: We investigate the performance of GPT and LLaMA compared to pre-trained models on SMILES in embedding SMILES strings on downstream tasks, focusing on two key applications: molecular property prediction and drug-drug interaction prediction.
  Results: We find that SMILES embeddings generated using LLaMA outperform those from GPT in both molecular property and DDI prediction tasks. Notably, LLaMA-based SMILES embeddings show results comparable to pre-trained models on SMILES in molecular prediction tasks and outperform the pre-trained models for the DDI prediction tasks.
  Conclusion: The performance of LLMs in generating SMILES embeddings shows great potential for further investigation of these models for molecular embedding. We hope our study bridges the gap between LLMs and molecular embedding, motivating additional research into the potential of LLMs in the molecular representation field.

      <title>The Effect of Data Poisoning on Counterfactual Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08290v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide a popular method for analyzing the predictions of black-box systems, and they can offer the opportunity for computational recourse by suggesting actionable changes on how to change the input to obtain a different (i.e.\ more favorable) system output. However, recent work highlighted their vulnerability to different types of manipulations.
  This work studies the vulnerability of counterfactual explanations to data poisoning. We formally introduce and investigate data poisoning in the context of counterfactual explanations for increasing the cost of recourse on three different levels: locally for a single instance, or a sub-group of instances, or globally for all instances. In this context, we characterize and prove the correctness of several different data poisonings. We also empirically demonstrate that state-of-the-art counterfactual generation methods and toolboxes are vulnerable to such data poisoning.</description>

      <title>Advanced Drug Interaction Event Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting drug-drug interaction adverse events, so-called DDI events, is increasingly valuable as it facilitates the study of mechanisms underlying drug use or adverse reactions. Existing models often neglect the distinctive characteristics of individual event classes when integrating multi-source features, which contributes to systematic unfairness when dealing with highly imbalanced event samples. Moreover, the limited capacity of these models to abstract the unique attributes of each event subclass considerably hampers their application in predicting rare drug-drug interaction events with a limited sample size. Reducing dataset bias and abstracting event subclass characteristics are two unresolved challenges. Recently, prompt tuning with frozen pre-trained graph models, namely "pre-train, prompt, fine-tune" strategy, has demonstrated impressive performance in few-shot tasks. Motivated by this, we propose DDIPrompt as a solution to address these aforementioned challenges. Specifically, our proposed approach entails a hierarchical pre-training task that aims to capture crucial aspects of drug molecular structure and intermolecular interactions while effectively mitigating implicit dataset bias within the node embeddings. Furthermore, we construct a prototypical graph by strategically sampling data from distinct event types and design subgraph prompts utilizing pre-trained node features. Through comprehensive benchmark experiments, we validate the efficacy of our subgraph prompts in accurately representing event classes and achieve exemplary results in both overall and subclass prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>HyperMoE: Towards Better Mixture of Experts via Transferring Among Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12656v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) for language models has been proven effective in augmenting the capacity of models by dynamically routing each input token to a specific subset of experts for processing. Despite the success, most existing methods face a challenge for balance between sparsity and the availability of expert knowledge: enhancing performance through increased use of expert knowledge often results in diminishing sparsity during expert selection. To mitigate this contradiction, we propose HyperMoE, a novel MoE framework built upon Hypernetworks. This framework integrates the computational processes of MoE with the concept of knowledge transferring in multi-task learning. Specific modules generated based on the information of unselected experts serve as supplementary information, which allows the knowledge of experts not selected to be used while maintaining selection sparsity. Our comprehensive empirical evaluations across multiple datasets and backbones establish that HyperMoE significantly outperforms existing MoE methods under identical conditions concerning the number of experts.</description>

      <title>Stable Neural Stochastic Differential Equations in Analyzing Irregular Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Irregular sampling intervals and missing values in real-world time series data present challenges for conventional methods that assume consistent intervals and complete data. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) offer an alternative approach, utilizing neural networks combined with ODE solvers to learn continuous latent representations through parameterized vector fields. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) extend Neural ODEs by incorporating a diffusion term, although this addition is not trivial, particularly when addressing irregular intervals and missing values. Consequently, careful design of drift and diffusion functions is crucial for maintaining stability and enhancing performance, while incautious choices can result in adverse properties such as the absence of strong solutions, stochastic destabilization, or unstable Euler discretizations, significantly affecting Neural SDEs' performance. In this study, we propose three stable classes of Neural SDEs: Langevin-type SDE, Linear Noise SDE, and Geometric SDE. Then, we rigorously demonstrate their robustness in maintaining excellent performance under distribution shift, while effectively preventing overfitting. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets for interpolation, forecasting, and classification tasks, and analyze the robustness of our methods with 30 public datasets under different missing rates. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in handling real-world irregular time series data.</description>

      <title>Robust Guidance for Unsupervised Data Selection: Capturing Perplexing Named Entities for Domain-Specific Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-resourced data presents a significant challenge for neural machine translation. In most cases, the low-resourced environment is caused by high costs due to the need for domain experts or the lack of language experts. Therefore, identifying the most training-efficient data within an unsupervised setting emerges as a practical strategy. Recent research suggests that such effective data can be identified by selecting 'appropriately complex data' based on its volume, providing strong intuition for unsupervised data selection. However, we have discovered that establishing criteria for unsupervised data selection remains a challenge, as the 'appropriate level of difficulty' may vary depending on the data domain. We introduce a novel unsupervised data selection method named 'Capturing Perplexing Named Entities,' which leverages the maximum inference entropy in translated named entities as a metric for selection. When tested with the 'Korean-English Parallel Corpus of Specialized Domains,' our method served as robust guidance for identifying training-efficient data across different domains, in contrast to existing methods.</description>

While most of the existing counterfactual methods explain a single instance, several real-world problems, such as customer satisfaction, require the identification of a single counterfactual that can satisfy multiple instances (e.g. customers) simultaneously. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose a flexible two-stage algorithm for finding groups of instances and computing cost-efficient multi-instance counterfactual explanations. The paper presents the algorithm and its performance against popular alternatives through a comparative evaluation.</description>

      <title>Learning to Maximize Mutual Information for Chain-of-Thought Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation, the technique of transferring knowledge from large, complex models to smaller ones, marks a pivotal step towards efficient AI deployment. Distilling Step-by-Step (DSS), a novel method utilizing chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation, has demonstrated promise by imbuing smaller models with the superior reasoning capabilities of their larger counterparts. In DSS, the distilled model acquires the ability to generate rationales and predict labels concurrently through a multi-task learning framework. However, DSS overlooks the intrinsic relationship between the two training tasks, leading to ineffective integration of CoT knowledge with the task of label prediction. To this end, we investigate the mutual relationship of the two tasks from Information Bottleneck perspective and formulate it as maximizing the mutual information of the representation features of the two tasks. We propose a variational approach to solve this optimization problem using a learning-based method. Our experimental results across four datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art DSS. Our findings offer insightful guidance for future research on language model distillation as well as applications involving CoT. Code and models will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Efficient Data Collection for Robotic Manipulation via Compositional Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data collection has become an increasingly important problem in robotic manipulation, yet there still lacks much understanding of how to effectively collect data to facilitate broad generalization. Recent works on large-scale robotic data collection typically vary many environmental factors of variation (e.g., object types, table textures) during data collection, to cover a diverse range of scenarios. However, they do not explicitly account for the possible compositional abilities of policies trained on the data. If robot policies can compose environmental factors from their data to succeed when encountering unseen factor combinations, we can exploit this to avoid collecting data for situations that composition would address. To investigate this possibility, we conduct thorough empirical studies both in simulation and on a real robot that compare data collection strategies and assess whether visual imitation learning policies can compose environmental factors. We find that policies do exhibit composition, although leveraging prior robotic datasets is critical for this on a real robot. We use these insights to propose better in-domain data collection strategies that exploit composition, which can induce better generalization than naive approaches for the same amount of effort during data collection. We further demonstrate that a real robot policy trained on data from such a strategy achieves a success rate of 77.5% when transferred to entirely new environments that encompass unseen combinations of environmental factors, whereas policies trained using data collected without accounting for environmental variation fail to transfer effectively, with a success rate of only 2.5%.

      <title>Emergence of Social Norms in Generative Agent Societies: Principles and Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social norms play a crucial role in guiding agents towards understanding and adhering to standards of behavior, thus reducing social conflicts within multi-agent systems (MASs). However, current LLM-based (or generative) MASs lack the capability to be normative. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture, named CRSEC, to empower the emergence of social norms within generative MASs. Our architecture consists of four modules: Creation &amp; Representation, Spreading, Evaluation, and Compliance. This addresses several important aspects of the emergent processes all in one: (i) where social norms come from, (ii) how they are formally represented, (iii) how they spread through agents' communications and observations, (iv) how they are examined with a sanity check and synthesized in the long term, and (v) how they are incorporated into agents' planning and actions. Our experiments deployed in the Smallville sandbox game environment demonstrate the capability of our architecture to establish social norms and reduce social conflicts within generative MASs. The positive outcomes of our human evaluation, conducted with 30 evaluators, further affirm the effectiveness of our approach.

      <title>AdaptSFL: Adaptive Split Federated Learning in Resource-constrained Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of deep neural networks poses significant barriers to democratizing them to resource-limited edge devices. To address this challenge, split federated learning (SFL) has emerged as a promising solution by of floading the primary training workload to a server via model partitioning while enabling parallel training among edge devices. However, although system optimization substantially influences the performance of SFL under resource-constrained systems, the problem remains largely uncharted. In this paper, we provide a convergence analysis of SFL which quantifies the impact of model splitting (MS) and client-side model aggregation (MA) on the learning performance, serving as a theoretical foundation. Then, we propose AdaptSFL, a novel resource-adaptive SFL framework, to expedite SFL under resource-constrained edge computing systems. Specifically, AdaptSFL adaptively controls client-side MA and MS to balance communication-computing latency and training convergence. Extensive simulations across various datasets validate that our proposed AdaptSFL framework takes considerably less time to achieve a target accuracy than benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.</description>

      <title>SPTNet: An Efficient Alternative Framework for Generalized Category Discovery with Spatial Prompt Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify unlabelled images from both `seen' and `unseen' classes by transferring knowledge from a set of labelled `seen' class images. A key theme in existing GCD approaches is adapting large-scale pre-trained models for the GCD task. An alternate perspective, however, is to adapt the data representation itself for better alignment with the pre-trained model. As such, in this paper, we introduce a two-stage adaptation approach termed SPTNet, which iteratively optimizes model parameters (i.e., model-finetuning) and data parameters (i.e., prompt learning). Furthermore, we propose a novel spatial prompt tuning method (SPT) which considers the spatial property of image data, enabling the method to better focus on object parts, which can transfer between seen and unseen classes. We thoroughly evaluate our SPTNet on standard benchmarks and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing GCD methods. Notably, we find our method achieves an average accuracy of 61.4% on the SSB, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods by approximately 10%. The improvement is particularly remarkable as our method yields extra parameters amounting to only 0.117% of those in the backbone architecture.

      <title>Large Language Model Can Continue Evolving From Mistakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As world knowledge evolves and new task paradigms emerge, Large Language Models (LLMs) often fall short of meeting new demands due to knowledge deficiencies and outdated information. Continual Learning (CL) is crucial for keeping LLMs up-to-date and addressing these deficiencies. However, traditional CL approaches struggle to balance task-width generality with task-depth specificity and often lack efficient data collection strategies, leading to increased training costs without addressing the model's most critical needs.
  Inspired by the `summarizing mistakes' learning skill, we propose the Continue Evolving from Mistakes (CEM) method. This iterative approach continually evaluates LLMs to identify knowledge deficiencies based on their mistakes, collecting relevant data from multiple sources to supplement training in a targeted manner. To enhance the model's utilization of supplemental knowledge and prevent forgetting, we developed three dataset construction strategies that integrate various types of continual pretraining (CPT) data and continual instruction tuning (CIT) data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the CEM method, achieving up to a 17% improvement in LLM accuracy in the best scenarios. Additionally, further experiments confirm the potential of combining CEM with other catastrophic forgetting mitigation strategies, enabling multi-round iterative optimization.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and modeling harms from interactions with design patterns in AI interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of applications using artificial intelligence (AI) systems has led to a growing number of users interacting with these systems through sophisticated interfaces. Human-computer interaction research has long shown that interfaces shape both user behavior and user perception of technical capabilities and risks. Yet, practitioners and researchers evaluating the social and ethical risks of AI systems tend to overlook the impact of anthropomorphic, deceptive, and immersive interfaces on human-AI interactions. Here, we argue that design features of interfaces with adaptive AI systems can have cascading impacts, driven by feedback loops, which extend beyond those previously considered. We first conduct a scoping review of AI interface designs and their negative impact to extract salient themes of potentially harmful design patterns in AI interfaces. Then, we propose Design-Enhanced Control of AI systems (DECAI), a conceptual model to structure and facilitate impact assessments of AI interface designs. DECAI draws on principles from control systems theory -- a theory for the analysis and design of dynamic physical systems -- to dissect the role of the interface in human-AI systems. Through two case studies on recommendation systems and conversational language model systems, we show how DECAI can be used to evaluate AI interface designs.</description>

      <title>Exploring Diverse Methods in Visual Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores innovative methods for improving Visual Question Answering (VQA) using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), autoencoders, and attention mechanisms. Leveraging a balanced VQA dataset, we investigate three distinct strategies. Firstly, GAN-based approaches aim to generate answer embeddings conditioned on image and question inputs, showing potential but struggling with more complex tasks. Secondly, autoencoder-based techniques focus on learning optimal embeddings for questions and images, achieving comparable results with GAN due to better ability on complex questions. Lastly, attention mechanisms, incorporating Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling (MCB), address language priors and attention modeling, albeit with a complexity-performance trade-off. This study underscores the challenges and opportunities in VQA and suggests avenues for future research, including alternative GAN formulations and attentional mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Adapting to time: why nature evolved a diverse set of neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brains have evolved a diverse set of neurons with varying morphologies, physiological properties and rich dynamics that impact their processing of temporal information. By contrast, most neural network models include a homogeneous set of units that only vary in terms of their spatial parameters (weights and biases). To investigate the importance of temporal parameters to neural function, we trained spiking neural networks on tasks of varying temporal complexity, with different subsets of parameters held constant. We find that in a tightly resource constrained setting, adapting conduction delays is essential to solve all test conditions, and indeed that it is possible to solve these tasks using only temporal parameters (delays and time constants) with weights held constant. In the most complex spatio-temporal task we studied, we found that an adaptable bursting parameter was essential. More generally, allowing for adaptation of both temporal and spatial parameters increases network robustness to noise, an important feature for both biological brains and neuromorphic computing systems. In summary, our findings highlight how rich and adaptable dynamics are key to solving temporally structured tasks at a low neural resource cost, which may be part of the reason why biological neurons vary so dramatically in their physiological properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the security of web application code generated by Large Language Models, analyzing 2,500 GPT-4 generated PHP websites. These were deployed in Docker containers and tested for vulnerabilities using a hybrid approach of Burp Suite active scanning, static analysis, and manual review. Our investigation focuses on identifying Insecure File Upload, SQL Injection, Stored XSS, and Reflected XSS in GPT-4 generated PHP code. This analysis highlights potential security risks and the implications of deploying such code in real-world scenarios. Overall, our analysis found 2,440 vulnerable parameters. According to Burp's Scan, 11.56% of the sites can be straight out compromised. Adding static scan results, 26% had at least one vulnerability that can be exploited through web interaction. Certain coding scenarios, like file upload functionality, are insecure 78% of the time, underscoring significant risks to software safety and security. To support further research, we have made the source codes and a detailed vulnerability record for each sample publicly available. This study emphasizes the crucial need for thorough testing and evaluation if generative AI technologies are used in software development.</description>

      <title>Beyond Code Generation: An Observational Study of ChatGPT Usage in Software Engineering Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently discussed in academia and the general public as support tools for virtually any use case that relies on the production of text, including software engineering. Currently there is much debate, but little empirical evidence, regarding the practical usefulness of LLM-based tools such as ChatGPT for engineers in industry. We conduct an observational study of 24 professional software engineers who have been using ChatGPT over a period of one week in their jobs, and qualitatively analyse their dialogues with the chatbot as well as their overall experience (as captured by an exit survey). We find that, rather than expecting ChatGPT to generate ready-to-use software artifacts (e.g., code), practitioners more often use ChatGPT to receive guidance on how to solve their tasks or learn about a topic in more abstract terms. We also propose a theoretical framework for how (i) purpose of the interaction, (ii) internal factors (e.g., the user's personality), and (iii) external factors (e.g., company policy) together shape the experience (in terms of perceived usefulness and trust). We envision that our framework can be used by future research to further the academic discussion on LLM usage by software engineering practitioners, and to serve as a reference point for the design of future empirical LLM research in this domain.</description>

      <title>RetinaRegNet: A Versatile Approach for Retinal Image Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the RetinaRegNet model, which can achieve state-of-the-art performance across various retinal image registration tasks. RetinaRegNet does not require training on any retinal images. It begins by establishing point correspondences between two retinal images using image features derived from diffusion models. This process involves the selection of feature points from the moving image using the SIFT algorithm alongside random point sampling. For each selected feature point, a 2D correlation map is computed by assessing the similarity between the feature vector at that point and the feature vectors of all pixels in the fixed image. The pixel with the highest similarity score in the correlation map corresponds to the feature point in the moving image. To remove outliers in the estimated point correspondences, we first applied an inverse consistency constraint, followed by a transformation-based outlier detector. This method proved to outperform the widely used random sample consensus (RANSAC) outlier detector by a significant margin. To handle large deformations, we utilized a two-stage image registration framework. A homography transformation was used in the first stage and a more accurate third-order polynomial transformation was used in the second stage. The model's effectiveness was demonstrated across three retinal image datasets: color fundus images, fluorescein angiography images, and laser speckle flowgraphy images. RetinaRegNet outperformed current state-of-the-art methods in all three datasets. It was especially effective for registering image pairs with large displacement and scaling deformations. This innovation holds promise for various applications in retinal image analysis. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/mirthAI/RetinaRegNet .</description>

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) quantifies network uncertainty by building a small prediction set with a pre-defined probability that the correct class is within this set. In this study we tackle the problem of CP calibration based on a validation set with noisy labels. We introduce a conformal score that is robust to label noise. The noise-free conformal score is estimated using the noisy labeled data and the noise level. In the test phase the noise-free score is used to form the prediction set. We applied the proposed algorithm to several standard medical imaging classification datasets. We show that our method outperforms current methods by a large margin, in terms of the average size of the prediction set, while maintaining the required coverage.</description>

      <title>Vidur: A Large-Scale Simulation Framework For LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimizing the deployment of Large language models (LLMs) is expensive today since it requires experimentally running an application workload against an LLM implementation while exploring large configuration space formed by system knobs such as parallelization strategies, batching techniques, and scheduling policies. To address this challenge, we present Vidur - a large-scale, high-fidelity, easily-extensible simulation framework for LLM inference performance. Vidur models the performance of LLM operators using a combination of experimental profiling and predictive modeling, and evaluates the end-to-end inference performance for different workloads by estimating several metrics of interest such as latency and throughput. We validate the fidelity of Vidur on several LLMs and show that it estimates inference latency with less than 9% error across the range. Further, we present Vidur-Search, a configuration search tool that helps optimize LLM deployment. Vidur-Search uses Vidur to automatically identify the most cost-effective deployment configuration that meets application performance constraints. For example, Vidur-Search finds the best deployment configuration for LLaMA2-70B in one hour on a CPU machine, in contrast to a deployment-based exploration which would require 42K GPU hours - costing ~218K dollars. Source code for Vidur is available at https://github.com/microsoft/vidur.</description>

Abstract: The strategic significance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in economic expansion, innovation, societal development, and national security has been increasingly recognized since the advent of ChatGPT. This study provides a comprehensive comparative evaluation of American and Chinese LLMs in both English and Chinese contexts. We proposed a comprehensive evaluation framework that encompasses natural language proficiency, disciplinary expertise, and safety and responsibility, and systematically assessed 16 prominent models from the US and China under various operational tasks and scenarios. Our key findings show that GPT 4-Turbo is at the forefront in English contexts, whereas Ernie-Bot 4 stands out in Chinese contexts. The study also highlights disparities in LLM performance across languages and tasks, stressing the necessity for linguistically and culturally nuanced model development. The complementary strengths of American and Chinese LLMs point to the value of Sino-US collaboration in advancing LLM technology. The research presents the current LLM competition landscape and offers valuable insights for policymakers and businesses regarding strategic LLM investments and development. Future work will expand on this framework to include emerging LLM multimodal capabilities and business application assessments.</description>

      <title>Can we Defend Against the Unknown? An Empirical Study About Threshold Selection for Neural Network Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing use of neural networks in critical systems, runtime monitoring becomes essential to reject unsafe predictions during inference. Various techniques have emerged to establish rejection scores that maximize the separability between the distributions of safe and unsafe predictions. The efficacy of these approaches is mostly evaluated using threshold-agnostic metrics, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. However, in real-world applications, an effective monitor also requires identifying a good threshold to transform these scores into meaningful binary decisions. Despite the pivotal importance of threshold optimization, this problem has received little attention. A few studies touch upon this question, but they typically assume that the runtime data distribution mirrors the training distribution, which is a strong assumption as monitors are supposed to safeguard a system against potentially unforeseen threats. In this work, we present rigorous experiments on various image datasets to investigate: 1. The effectiveness of monitors in handling unforeseen threats, which are not available during threshold adjustments. 2. Whether integrating generic threats into the threshold optimization scheme can enhance the robustness of monitors.</description>

      <title>Beyond static AI evaluations: advancing human interaction evaluations for LLM harms and risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model evaluations are central to understanding the safety, risks, and societal impacts of AI systems. While most real-world AI applications involve human-AI interaction, most current evaluations (e.g., common benchmarks) of AI models do not. Instead, they incorporate human factors in limited ways, assessing the safety of models in isolation, thereby falling short of capturing the complexity of human-model interactions. In this paper, we discuss and operationalize a definition of an emerging category of evaluations -- "human interaction evaluations" (HIEs) -- which focus on the assessment of human-model interactions or the process and the outcomes of humans using models. First, we argue that HIEs can be used to increase the validity of safety evaluations, assess direct human impact and interaction-specific harms, and guide future assessments of models' societal impact. Second, we propose a safety-focused HIE design framework -- containing a human-LLM interaction taxonomy -- with three stages: (1) identifying the risk or harm area, (2) characterizing the use context, and (3) choosing the evaluation parameters. Third, we apply our framework to two potential evaluations for overreliance and persuasion risks. Finally, we conclude with tangible recommendations for addressing concerns over costs, replicability, and unrepresentativeness of HIEs.</description>

      <title>Bottleneck-Minimal Indexing for Generative Document Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply an information-theoretic perspective to reconsider generative document retrieval (GDR), in which a document $x \in X$ is indexed by $t \in T$, and a neural autoregressive model is trained to map queries $Q$ to $T$. GDR can be considered to involve information transmission from documents $X$ to queries $Q$, with the requirement to transmit more bits via the indexes $T$. By applying Shannon's rate-distortion theory, the optimality of indexing can be analyzed in terms of the mutual information, and the design of the indexes $T$ can then be regarded as a {\em bottleneck} in GDR. After reformulating GDR from this perspective, we empirically quantify the bottleneck underlying GDR. Finally, using the NQ320K and MARCO datasets, we evaluate our proposed bottleneck-minimal indexing method in comparison with various previous indexing methods, and we show that it outperforms those methods.</description>

      <title>The MovieLens Beliefs Dataset: Collecting Pre-Choice Data for Online Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An increasingly important aspect of designing recommender systems involves considering how recommendations will influence consumer choices. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a method for collecting user beliefs about un-experienced items - a critical predictor of choice behavior. We implemented this method on the MovieLens platform, resulting in a rich dataset that combines user ratings, beliefs, and observed recommendations. We document challenges to such data collection, including selection bias in response and limited coverage of the product space. This unique resource empowers researchers to delve deeper into user behavior and analyze user choices absent recommendations, measure the effectiveness of recommendations, and prototype algorithms that leverage user belief data, ultimately leading to more impactful recommender systems. The dataset can be found at https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml_belief_2024/.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Discourse Structure for Extractive Meeting Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an extractive summarization system for meetings that leverages discourse structure to better identify salient information from complex multi-party discussions. Using discourse graphs to represent semantic relations between the contents of utterances in a meeting, we train a GNN-based node classification model to select the most important utterances, which are then combined to create an extractive summary. Experimental results on AMI and ICSI demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing text-based and graph-based extractive summarization systems, as measured by both classification and summarization metrics. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on discourse structure and relation type to provide insights for future NLP applications leveraging discourse analysis theory.</description>

      <title>Improved Content Understanding With Effective Use of Multi-task Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In enhancing LinkedIn core content recommendation models, a significant challenge lies in improving their semantic understanding capabilities. This paper addresses the problem by leveraging multi-task learning, a method that has shown promise in various domains. We fine-tune a pre-trained, transformer-based LLM using multi-task contrastive learning with data from a diverse set of semantic labeling tasks. We observe positive transfer, leading to superior performance across all tasks when compared to training independently on each. Our model outperforms the baseline on zero shot learning and offers improved multilingual support, highlighting its potential for broader application. The specialized content embeddings produced by our model outperform generalized embeddings offered by OpenAI on Linkedin dataset and tasks. This work provides a robust foundation for vertical teams across LinkedIn to customize and fine-tune the LLM to their specific applications. Our work offers insights and best practices for the field to build on.</description>

      <title>A Novel Cartography-Based Curriculum Learning Method Applied on RoNLI: The First Romanian Natural Language Inference Corpus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural language inference (NLI), the task of recognizing the entailment relationship in sentence pairs, is an actively studied topic serving as a proxy for natural language understanding. Despite the relevance of the task in building conversational agents and improving text classification, machine translation and other NLP tasks, to the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available NLI corpus for the Romanian language. To this end, we introduce the first Romanian NLI corpus (RoNLI) comprising 58K training sentence pairs, which are obtained via distant supervision, and 6K validation and test sentence pairs, which are manually annotated with the correct labels. We conduct experiments with multiple machine learning methods based on distant learning, ranging from shallow models based on word embeddings to transformer-based neural networks, to establish a set of competitive baselines. Furthermore, we improve on the best model by employing a new curriculum learning strategy based on data cartography. Our dataset and code to reproduce the baselines are available at https://github.com/Eduard6421/RONLI.</description>
