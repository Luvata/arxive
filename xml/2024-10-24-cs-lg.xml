      <title>Hydra-LSTM: A semi-shared Machine Learning architecture for prediction across Watersheds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs) are used to build single models that predict river discharge across many catchments. These models offer greater accuracy than models trained on each catchment independently if using the same data. However, the same data is rarely available for all catchments. This prevents the use of variables available only in some catchments, such as historic river discharge or upstream discharge. The only existing method that allows for optional variables requires all variables to be considered in the initial training of the model, limiting its transferability to new catchments. To address this limitation, we develop the Hydra-LSTM. The Hydra-LSTM processes variables used across all catchments and variables used in only some catchments separately to allow general training and use of catchment-specific data in individual catchments. The bulk of the model can be shared across catchments, maintaining the benefits of multi-catchment models to generalise, while also benefitting from the advantages of using bespoke data. We apply this methodology to 1 day-ahead river discharge prediction in the Western US, as next-day river discharge prediction is the first step towards prediction across longer time scales. We obtain state-of-the-art performance, generating more accurate median and quantile predictions than Multi-Catchment and Single-Catchment LSTMs while allowing local forecasters to easily introduce and remove variables from their prediction set. We test the ability of the Hydra-LSTM to incorporate catchment-specific data by introducing historical river discharge as a catchment-specific input, outperforming state-of-the-art models without needing to train an entirely new model.</description>

      <title>Exploring how deep learning decodes anomalous diffusion via Grad-CAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deep learning has been successfully applied to the data-driven classification of anomalous diffusion mechanisms, how the algorithm achieves the feat still remains a mystery. In this study, we use a well-known technique aimed at achieving explainable AI, namely the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Map (Grad-CAM), to investigate how deep learning (implemented by ResNets) recognizes the distinctive features of a particular anomalous diffusion model from the raw trajectory data. Our results show that Grad-CAM reveals the portions of the trajectory that hold crucial information about the underlying mechanism of anomalous diffusion, which can be utilized to enhance the robustness of the trained classifier against the measurement noise. Moreover, we observe that deep learning distills unique statistical characteristics of different diffusion mechanisms at various spatiotemporal scales, with larger-scale (smaller-scale) features identified at higher (lower) layers.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models in Computer Science Education: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly better at a wide range of Natural Language Processing tasks (NLP), such as text generation and understanding. Recently, these models have extended their capabilities to coding tasks, bridging the gap between natural languages (NL) and programming languages (PL). Foundational models such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and LLaMA series have set strong baseline performances in various NL and PL tasks. Additionally, several models have been fine-tuned specifically for code generation, showing significant improvements in code-related applications. Both foundational and fine-tuned models are increasingly used in education, helping students write, debug, and understand code. We present a comprehensive systematic literature review to examine the impact of LLMs in computer science and computer engineering education. We analyze their effectiveness in enhancing the learning experience, supporting personalized education, and aiding educators in curriculum development. We address five research questions to uncover insights into how LLMs contribute to educational outcomes, identify challenges, and suggest directions for future research.</description>

      <title>LEGO-Learn: Label-Efficient Graph Open-Set Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we train graph-based models to recognize unseen classes while keeping labeling costs low? Graph open-set learning (GOL) and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aim to address this challenge by training models that can accurately classify known, in-distribution (ID) classes while identifying and handling previously unseen classes during inference. It is critical for high-stakes, real-world applications where models frequently encounter unexpected data, including finance, security, and healthcare. However, current GOL methods assume access to many labeled ID samples, which is unrealistic for large-scale graphs due to high annotation costs.
  In this paper, we propose LEGO-Learn (Label-Efficient Graph Open-set Learning), a novel framework that tackles open-set node classification on graphs within a given label budget by selecting the most informative ID nodes. LEGO-Learn employs a GNN-based filter to identify and exclude potential OOD nodes and then select highly informative ID nodes for labeling using the K-Medoids algorithm. To prevent the filter from discarding valuable ID examples, we introduce a classifier that differentiates between the C known ID classes and an additional class representing OOD nodes (hence, a C+1 classifier). This classifier uses a weighted cross-entropy loss to balance the removal of OOD nodes while retaining informative ID nodes. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that LEGO-Learn significantly outperforms leading methods, with up to a 6.62% improvement in ID classification accuracy and a 7.49% increase in AUROC for OOD detection.</description>

      <title>Federated Communication-Efficient Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a federated version of multi-objective optimization (MOO), where a single model is trained to optimize multiple objective functions. MOO has been extensively studied in the centralized setting but is less explored in federated or distributed settings. We propose FedCMOO, a novel communication-efficient federated multi-objective optimization (FMOO) algorithm that improves the error convergence performance of the model compared to existing approaches. Unlike prior works, the communication cost of FedCMOO does not scale with the number of objectives, as each client sends a single aggregated gradient, obtained using randomized SVD (singular value decomposition), to the central server. We provide a convergence analysis of the proposed method for smooth non-convex objective functions under milder assumptions than in prior work. In addition, we introduce a variant of FedCMOO that allows users to specify a preference over the objectives in terms of a desired ratio of the final objective values. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Simplicity Bias via Global Convergence of Sharpness Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable generalization ability of neural networks is usually attributed to the implicit bias of SGD, which often yields models with lower complexity using simpler (e.g. linear) and low-rank features. Recent works have provided empirical and theoretical evidence for the bias of particular variants of SGD (such as label noise SGD) toward flatter regions of the loss landscape. Despite the folklore intuition that flat solutions are 'simple', the connection with the simplicity of the final trained model (e.g. low-rank) is not well understood. In this work, we take a step toward bridging this gap by studying the simplicity structure that arises from minimizers of the sharpness for a class of two-layer neural networks. We show that, for any high dimensional training data and certain activations, with small enough step size, label noise SGD always converges to a network that replicates a single linear feature across all neurons; thereby, implying a simple rank one feature matrix. To obtain this result, our main technical contribution is to show that label noise SGD always minimizes the sharpness on the manifold of models with zero loss for two-layer networks. Along the way, we discover a novel property -- a local geodesic convexity -- of the trace of Hessian of the loss at approximate stationary points on the manifold of zero loss, which links sharpness to the geometry of the manifold. This tool may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction Using Applied Bayesian Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study applies Bayesian models to predict hotel booking cancellations, a key challenge affecting resource allocation, revenue, and customer satisfaction in the hospitality industry. Using a Kaggle dataset with 36,285 observations and 17 features, Bayesian Logistic Regression and Beta-Binomial models were implemented. The logistic model, applied to 12 features and 5,000 randomly selected observations, outperformed the Beta-Binomial model in predictive accuracy. Key predictors included the number of adults, children, stay duration, lead time, car parking space, room type, and special requests. Model evaluation using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV) confirmed strong alignment between observed and predicted outcomes, demonstrating the model's robustness. Special requests and parking availability were found to be the strongest predictors of cancellation. This Bayesian approach provides a valuable tool for improving booking management and operational efficiency in the hotel industry.</description>

      <title>On conditional diffusion models for PDE simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling partial differential equations (PDEs) is of crucial importance in science and engineering, and it includes tasks ranging from forecasting to inverse problems, such as data assimilation. However, most previous numerical and machine learning approaches that target forecasting cannot be applied out-of-the-box for data assimilation. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for conditional generation, being able to flexibly incorporate observations without retraining. In this work, we perform a comparative study of score-based diffusion models for forecasting and assimilation of sparse observations. In particular, we focus on diffusion models that are either trained in a conditional manner, or conditioned after unconditional training. We address the shortcomings of existing models by proposing 1) an autoregressive sampling approach that significantly improves performance in forecasting, 2) a new training strategy for conditional score-based models that achieves stable performance over a range of history lengths, and 3) a hybrid model which employs flexible pre-training conditioning on initial conditions and flexible post-training conditioning to handle data assimilation. We empirically show that these modifications are crucial for successfully tackling the combination of forecasting and data assimilation, a task commonly encountered in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Promoting cross-modal representations to improve multimodal foundation models for physiological signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, involving several physiological signals. As sensors for these signals become more common, improving machine learning methods for multimodal healthcare data is crucial. Pretraining foundation models is a promising avenue for success. However, methods for developing foundation models in healthcare are still in early exploration and it is unclear which pretraining strategies are most effective given the diversity of physiological signals. This is partly due to challenges in multimodal health data: obtaining data across many patients is difficult and costly, there is a lot of inter-subject variability, and modalities are often heterogeneously informative across downstream tasks. Here, we explore these challenges in the PhysioNet 2018 dataset. We use a masked autoencoding objective to pretrain a multimodal model. We show that the model learns representations that can be linearly probed for a diverse set of downstream tasks. We hypothesize that cross-modal reconstruction objectives are important for successful multimodal training, as they encourage the model to integrate information across modalities. We demonstrate that modality dropout in the input space improves performance across downstream tasks. We also find that late-fusion models pretrained with contrastive learning objectives are less effective across multiple tasks. Finally, we analyze the model's representations, showing that attention weights become more cross-modal and temporally aligned with our pretraining strategy. The learned embeddings also become more distributed in terms of the modalities encoded by each unit. Overall, our work demonstrates the utility of multimodal foundation models with health data, even across diverse physiological data sources. We further argue that explicit methods for inducing cross-modality may enhance multimodal pretraining strategies.</description>

      <title>Fair Bilevel Neural Network (FairBiNN): On Balancing fairness and accuracy via Stackelberg Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistent challenge of bias in machine learning models necessitates robust solutions to ensure parity and equal treatment across diverse groups, particularly in classification tasks. Current methods for mitigating bias often result in information loss and an inadequate balance between accuracy and fairness. To address this, we propose a novel methodology grounded in bilevel optimization principles. Our deep learning-based approach concurrently optimizes for both accuracy and fairness objectives, and under certain assumptions, achieving proven Pareto optimal solutions while mitigating bias in the trained model. Theoretical analysis indicates that the upper bound on the loss incurred by this method is less than or equal to the loss of the Lagrangian approach, which involves adding a regularization term to the loss function. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model primarily on tabular datasets such as UCI Adult and Heritage Health. When benchmarked against state-of-the-art fairness methods, our model exhibits superior performance, advancing fairness-aware machine learning solutions and bridging the accuracy-fairness gap. The implementation of FairBiNN is available on https://github.com/yazdanimehdi/FairBiNN.</description>

      <title>In Search of the Successful Interpolation: On the Role of Sharpness in CLIP Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \textit{Zero-shot} models like CLIP are often fine-tuned on a target dataset to improve its accuracy further, but this can compromise out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. Robust Fine-Tuning (\texttt{RFT} )~\citep{wortsman2021robust}, which interpolates between the \textit{zero-shot} and \textit{fine-tuned} models, has been proposed to address this issue. However, understanding when \texttt{RFT} actually improves OOD error remains limited. In this work, we empirically investigate the robustness of \texttt{RFT} in CLIP models, with a focus on the \textit{sharpness} of the CLIP model during interpolation. First, we demonstrate that while sharpness may not serve as a reliable indicator for predicting the generalization of modern architectures like CLIP on OOD data, this challenges the conventional belief in the generalization benefits of flat minima in foundation models. However, by examining the role of the \textit{straggler layer} phenomenon, we show that, unlike overall sharpness, the \textit{layer-wise} sharpness of \textit{straggler} layers can reliably capture the generalization performance of interpolated CLIP models on OOD data. Our extensive experiments reveal that \textit{layer-wise} sharpness correlates with generalization in OOD accuracy for \texttt{RFT}. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by inducing sparsity in the \textit{straggler} layers, we can mitigate the \textit{failure mode} phenomenon in \texttt{RFT}. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study the role of sharpness in the \textit{success} of interpolation in the weight space of CLIP foundation models. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/alirezaabdollahpour/CLIP_Mode_Connectivity}.</description>

      <title>Identifying Sub-networks in Neural Networks via Functionally Similar Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to provide human-understandable insights into the inner workings of neural network models by examining their internals. Existing approaches typically require significant manual effort and prior knowledge, with strategies tailored to specific tasks. In this work, we take a step toward automating the understanding of the network by investigating the existence of distinct sub-networks. Specifically, we explore a novel automated and task-agnostic approach based on the notion of functionally similar representations within neural networks, reducing the need for human intervention. Our method identifies similar and dissimilar layers in the network, revealing potential sub-components. We achieve this by proposing, for the first time to our knowledge, the use of Gromov-Wasserstein distance, which overcomes challenges posed by varying distributions and dimensionalities across intermediate representations, issues that complicate direct layer-to-layer comparisons. Through experiments on algebraic and language tasks, we observe the emergence of sub-groups within neural network layers corresponding to functional abstractions. Additionally, we find that different training strategies influence the positioning of these sub-groups. Our approach offers meaningful insights into the behavior of neural networks with minimal human and computational cost.</description>

      <title>Survival Multiarmed Bandits with Boostrapping Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Multiarmed Bandits (MAB) problem has been extensively studied and has seen many practical applications in a variety of fields. The Survival Multiarmed Bandits (S-MAB) open problem is an extension which constrains an agent to a budget that is directly related to observed rewards. As budget depletion leads to ruin, an agent's objective is to both maximize expected cumulative rewards and minimize the probability of ruin. This paper presents a framework that addresses such dual goal using an objective function balanced by a ruin aversion component. Action values are estimated through a novel approach which consists of bootstrapping samples from previously observed rewards. In numerical experiments, the policies we present outperform benchmarks from the literature.</description>

      <title>LLM-TS Integrator: Integrating LLM for Enhanced Time Series Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series~(TS) modeling is essential in dynamic systems like weather prediction and anomaly detection. Recent studies utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for TS modeling, leveraging their powerful pattern recognition capabilities. These methods primarily position LLMs as the predictive backbone, often omitting the mathematical modeling within traditional TS models, such as periodicity. However, disregarding the potential of LLMs also overlooks their pattern recognition capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce \textit{LLM-TS Integrator}, a novel framework that effectively integrates the capabilities of LLMs into traditional TS modeling. Central to this integration is our \textit{mutual information} module. The core of this \textit{mutual information} module is a traditional TS model enhanced with LLM-derived insights for improved predictive abilities. This enhancement is achieved by maximizing the mutual information between traditional model's TS representations and LLM's textual representation counterparts, bridging the two modalities. Moreover, we recognize that samples vary in importance for two losses: traditional prediction and mutual information maximization. To address this variability, we introduce the \textit{sample reweighting} module to improve information utilization. This module assigns dual weights to each sample: one for prediction loss and another for mutual information loss, dynamically optimizing these weights via bi-level optimization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance across five mainstream TS tasks, including short-term and long-term forecasting, imputation, classification, and anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Opioid Incidents for Rapid Actionable Data for Opioid Response in Kentucky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present efforts in the fields of machine learning and time series forecasting to accurately predict counts of future opioid overdose incidents recorded by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in the state of Kentucky. Forecasts are useful to state government agencies to properly prepare and distribute resources related to opioid overdoses effectively. Our approach uses county and district level aggregations of EMS opioid overdose encounters and forecasts future counts for each month. A variety of additional covariates were tested to determine their impact on the model's performance. Models with different levels of complexity were evaluated to optimize training time and accuracy. Our results show that when special precautions are taken to address data sparsity, useful predictions can be generated with limited error by utilizing yearly trends and covariance with additional data sources.</description>

      <title>Scalability of memorization-based machine unlearning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning (MUL) focuses on removing the influence of specific subsets of data (such as noisy, poisoned, or privacy-sensitive data) from pretrained models. MUL methods typically rely on specialized forms of fine-tuning. Recent research has shown that data memorization is a key characteristic defining the difficulty of MUL. As a result, novel memorization-based unlearning methods have been developed, demonstrating exceptional performance with respect to unlearning quality, while maintaining high performance for model utility. Alas, these methods depend on knowing the memorization scores of data points and computing said scores is a notoriously time-consuming process. This in turn severely limits the scalability of these solutions and their practical impact for real-world applications. In this work, we tackle these scalability challenges of state-of-the-art memorization-based MUL algorithms using a series of memorization-score proxies. We first analyze the profiles of various proxies and then evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (memorization-based) MUL algorithms in terms of both accuracy and privacy preservation. Our empirical results show that these proxies can introduce accuracy on par with full memorization-based unlearning while dramatically improving scalability. We view this work as an important step toward scalable and efficient machine unlearning.</description>

      <title>RGMDT: Return-Gap-Minimizing Decision Tree Extraction in Non-Euclidean Metric Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have achieved great success in solving many challenging tasks while their black-box nature hinders interpretability and real-world applicability, making it difficult for human experts to interpret and understand DRL policies. Existing works on interpretable reinforcement learning have shown promise in extracting decision tree (DT) based policies from DRL policies with most focus on the single-agent settings while prior attempts to introduce DT policies in multi-agent scenarios mainly focus on heuristic designs which do not provide any quantitative guarantees on the expected return. In this paper, we establish an upper bound on the return gap between the oracle expert policy and an optimal decision tree policy. This enables us to recast the DT extraction problem into a novel non-euclidean clustering problem over the local observation and action values space of each agent, with action values as cluster labels and the upper bound on the return gap as clustering loss. Both the algorithm and the upper bound are extended to multi-agent decentralized DT extractions by an iteratively-grow-DT procedure guided by an action-value function conditioned on the current DTs of other agents. Further, we propose the Return-Gap-Minimization Decision Tree (RGMDT) algorithm, which is a surprisingly simple design and is integrated with reinforcement learning through the utilization of a novel Regularized Information Maximization loss. Evaluations on tasks like D4RL show that RGMDT significantly outperforms heuristic DT-based baselines and can achieve nearly optimal returns under given DT complexity constraints (e.g., maximum number of DT nodes).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current technological era, the medical profession has emerged as one of the researchers' favorite subject areas, and cancer is one of them. Because there is now no effective treatment for this illness, it is a matter of concern. Only if this disease is discovered early may patients be rescued (stage I and stage II). The likelihood of survival is quite low if it is discovered in later stages (stages III and IV). The application of machine learning, deep learning, and data mining techniques in the medical industry has the potential to address current issues and bring benefits. Numerous symptoms of cancer exist, including tumors, unusual bleeding, increased weight loss, etc. It is not necessary for all tumor types to be cancerous. There are two sorts of tumors: benign and malignant. To give patients, the right care, symptoms must be carefully examined, and an automated system is to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors. Most data produced in today's online environment comes from websites related to healthcare or social media. Using data mining techniques, it is possible to extract symptoms from this vast amount of data, which will be helpful for identifying or classifying cancer. This research classifies bacteria cells as benign or cancerous using various deep-learning Algorithms. To get the best and most reliable results for the classification, a variety of methodologies and models are trained and improved.</description>

      <title>Efficient Neural Network Training via Subset Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In training neural networks, it is common practice to use partial gradients computed over batches, mostly very small subsets of the training set. This approach is motivated by the argument that such a partial gradient is close to the true one, with precision growing only with the square root of the batch size. A theoretical justification is with the help of stochastic approximation theory. However, the conditions for the validity of this theory are not satisfied in the usual learning rate schedules. Batch processing is also difficult to combine with efficient second-order optimization methods. This proposal is based on another hypothesis: the loss minimum of the training set can be expected to be well-approximated by the minima of its subsets. Such subset minima can be computed in a fraction of the time necessary for optimizing over the whole training set. This hypothesis has been tested with the help of the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 image classification benchmarks, optionally extended by training data augmentation. The experiments have confirmed that results equivalent to conventional training can be reached. In summary, even small subsets are representative if the overdetermination ratio for the given model parameter set sufficiently exceeds unity. The computing expense can be reduced to a tenth or less.</description>

      <title>ADAM-SINDy: An Efficient Optimization Framework for Parameterized Nonlinear Dynamical System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying dynamical systems characterized by nonlinear parameters presents significant challenges in deriving mathematical models that enhance understanding of physics. Traditional methods, such as Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and symbolic regression, can extract governing equations from observational data; however, they also come with distinct advantages and disadvantages. This paper introduces a novel method within the SINDy framework, termed ADAM-SINDy, which synthesizes the strengths of established approaches by employing the ADAM optimization algorithm. This facilitates the simultaneous optimization of nonlinear parameters and coefficients associated with nonlinear candidate functions, enabling precise parameter estimation without requiring prior knowledge of nonlinear characteristics such as trigonometric frequencies, exponential bandwidths, or polynomial exponents, thereby addressing a key limitation of SINDy. Through an integrated global optimization, ADAM-SINDy dynamically adjusts all unknown variables in response to data, resulting in an adaptive identification procedure that reduces the sensitivity to the library of candidate functions. The performance of the ADAM-SINDy methodology is demonstrated across a spectrum of dynamical systems, including benchmark coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations such as oscillators, chaotic fluid flows, reaction kinetics, pharmacokinetics, as well as nonlinear partial differential equations (wildfire transport). The results demonstrate significant improvements in identifying parameterized dynamical systems and underscore the importance of concurrently optimizing all parameters, particularly those characterized by nonlinear parameters. These findings highlight the potential of ADAM-SINDy to extend the applicability of the SINDy framework in addressing more complex challenges in dynamical system identification.</description>

      <title>No more hard prompts: SoftSRV prompting for synthetic data generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel soft prompt based framework, SoftSRV, that leverages a frozen pre-trained large language model (LLM) to generate targeted synthetic text sequences. Given a sample from the target distribution, our proposed framework uses data-driven loss minimization to train a parameterized "contextual" soft prompt. This soft prompt is then used to steer the frozen LLM to generate synthetic sequences that are similar to the target distribution. We argue that SoftSRV provides a practical improvement over common hard-prompting approaches that rely on human-curated prompt-templates, which can be idiosyncratic, labor-intensive to craft, and may need to be specialized per domain. We empirically evaluate SoftSRV and hard-prompting baselines by generating synthetic data to fine-tune a small Gemma model on three different domains (coding, math, reasoning). To stress the generality of SoftSRV, we perform these evaluations without any particular specialization of the framework to each domain. We find that SoftSRV significantly improves upon hard-prompting baselines, generating data with superior fine-tuning performance and that better matches the target distribution according to the MAUVE similarity metric.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Study of Neural Network Expressive Power via Manifold Topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A prevalent assumption regarding real-world data is that it lies on or close to a low-dimensional manifold. When deploying a neural network on data manifolds, the required size, i.e., the number of neurons of the network, heavily depends on the intricacy of the underlying latent manifold. While significant advancements have been made in understanding the geometric attributes of manifolds, it's essential to recognize that topology, too, is a fundamental characteristic of manifolds. In this study, we investigate network expressive power in terms of the latent data manifold. Integrating both topological and geometric facets of the data manifold, we present a size upper bound of ReLU neural networks.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal Multivariate Cluster Evolution Analysis for Detecting and Tracking Climate Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing concern about climate change and its impacts. While Earth System Models (ESMs) can be invaluable tools for studying the impacts of climate change, the complex coupling processes encoded in ESMs and the large amounts of data produced by these models, together with the high internal variability of the Earth system, can obscure important source-to-impact relationships. This paper presents a novel and efficient unsupervised data-driven approach for detecting statistically-significant impacts and tracing spatio-temporal source-impact pathways in the climate through a unique combination of ideas from anomaly detection, clustering and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Using as an exemplar the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, we demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of detecting known post-eruption impacts/events. We additionally describe a methodology for extracting meaningful sequences of post-eruption impacts/events by using NLP to efficiently mine frequent multivariate cluster evolutions, which can be used to confirm or discover the chain of physical processes between a climate source and its impact(s).</description>

      <title>Can Transformers In-Context Learn Behavior of a Linear Dynamical System?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether transformers can learn to track a random process when given observations of a related process and parameters of the dynamical system that relates them as context. More specifically, we consider a finite-dimensional state-space model described by the state transition matrix $F$, measurement matrices $h_1, \dots, h_N$, and the process and measurement noise covariance matrices $Q$ and $R$, respectively; these parameters, randomly sampled, are provided to the transformer along with the observations $y_1,\dots,y_N$ generated by the corresponding linear dynamical system. We argue that in such settings transformers learn to approximate the celebrated Kalman filter, and empirically verify this both for the task of estimating hidden states $\hat{x}_{N|1,2,3,...,N}$ as well as for one-step prediction of the $(N+1)^{st}$ observation, $\hat{y}_{N+1|1,2,3,...,N}$. A further study of the transformer's robustness reveals that its performance is retained even if the model's parameters are partially withheld. In particular, we demonstrate that the transformer remains accurate at the considered task even in the absence of state transition and noise covariance matrices, effectively emulating operations of the Dual-Kalman filter.</description>

      <title>Gradient Normalization with(out) Clipping Ensures Convergence of Nonconvex SGD under Heavy-Tailed Noise with Improved Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates Gradient Normalization Stochastic Gradient Descent without Clipping (NSGDC) and its variance reduction variant (NSGDC-VR) for nonconvex optimization under heavy-tailed noise. We present significant improvements in the theoretical results for both algorithms, including the removal of logarithmic factors from the convergence rates and the recovery of the convergence rate to match the deterministic case when the noise variance {\sigma} is zero. Additionally, we demonstrate that gradient normalization alone, assuming individual Lipschitz smoothness, is sufficient to ensure convergence of SGD under heavy-tailed noise, eliminating the need for gradient clipping. Furthermore, we introduce accelerated nonconvex algorithms that utilize second-order Lipschitz smoothness to achieve enhanced convergence rates in the presence of heavy-tailed noise. Our findings offer a deeper understanding of how gradient normalization and variance reduction techniques can be optimized for robust performance in challenging optimization scenarios.</description>

      <title>Enhancing PAC Learning of Half spaces Through Robust Optimization Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of PAC learning half spaces under constant malicious noise, where a fraction of the training data is adversarially corrupted. While traditional learning models assume clean data, real-world applications often face noisy environments that can significantly degrade the performance of machine learning algorithms. My study presents a novel, efficient algorithm that extends the existing theoretical frameworks to account for noise resilience in half space learning. By leveraging robust optimization techniques and advanced error-correction strategies, the proposed approach improves learning accuracy in adversarial conditions without requiring additional computational complexity. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the algorithm's performance, demonstrating its superior robustness to malicious noise when compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Extensive theoretical evaluations are supported by empirical results that validate the algorithm's practical utility across a range of datasets and noise conditions. This work contributes to the field by offering a new, scalable solution to learning under noise, enhancing the reliability of machine learning systems in adversarial settings.</description>

      <title>Conflict-Aware Adversarial Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial training is the most effective method to obtain adversarial robustness for deep neural networks by directly involving adversarial samples in the training procedure. To obtain an accurate and robust model, the weighted-average method is applied to optimize standard loss and adversarial loss simultaneously. In this paper, we argue that the weighted-average method does not provide the best tradeoff for the standard performance and adversarial robustness. We argue that the failure of the weighted-average method is due to the conflict between the gradients derived from standard and adversarial loss, and further demonstrate such a conflict increases with attack budget theoretically and practically. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new trade-off paradigm for adversarial training with a conflict-aware factor for the convex combination of standard and adversarial loss, named \textbf{Conflict-Aware Adversarial Training~(CA-AT)}. Comprehensive experimental results show that CA-AT consistently offers a superior trade-off between standard performance and adversarial robustness under the settings of adversarial training from scratch and parameter-efficient finetuning.</description>

      <title>ViMGuard: A Novel Multi-Modal System for Video Misinformation Guarding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of social media and short-form video (SFV) has facilitated a breeding ground for misinformation. With the emergence of large language models, significant research has gone into curbing this misinformation problem with automatic false claim detection for text. Unfortunately, the automatic detection of misinformation in SFV is a more complex problem that remains largely unstudied. While text samples are monomodal (only containing words), SFVs comprise three different modalities: words, visuals, and non-linguistic audio. In this work, we introduce Video Masked Autoencoders for Misinformation Guarding (ViMGuard), the first deep-learning architecture capable of fact-checking an SFV through analysis of all three of its constituent modalities. ViMGuard leverages a dual-component system. First, Video and Audio Masked Autoencoders analyze the visual and non-linguistic audio elements of a video to discern its intention; specifically whether it intends to make an informative claim. If it is deemed that the SFV has informative intent, it is passed through our second component: a Retrieval Augmented Generation system that validates the factual accuracy of spoken words. In evaluation, ViMGuard outperformed three cutting-edge fact-checkers, thus setting a new standard for SFV fact-checking and marking a significant stride toward trustworthy news on social platforms. To promote further testing and iteration, VimGuard was deployed into a Chrome extension and all code was open-sourced on GitHub.</description>

      <title>GALA: Graph Diffusion-based Alignment with Jigsaw for Source-free Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation is a crucial machine learning topic, as it contains numerous applications in the real world, particularly with respect to data privacy. Existing approaches predominantly focus on Euclidean data, such as images and videos, while the exploration of non-Euclidean graph data remains scarce. Recent graph neural network (GNN) approaches can suffer from serious performance decline due to domain shift and label scarcity in source-free adaptation scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel method named Graph Diffusion-based Alignment with Jigsaw (GALA), tailored for source-free graph domain adaptation. To achieve domain alignment, GALA employs a graph diffusion model to reconstruct source-style graphs from target data. Specifically, a score-based graph diffusion model is trained using source graphs to learn the generative source styles. Then, we introduce perturbations to target graphs via a stochastic differential equation instead of sampling from a prior, followed by the reverse process to reconstruct source-style graphs. We feed the source-style graphs into an off-the-shelf GNN and introduce class-specific thresholds with curriculum learning, which can generate accurate and unbiased pseudo-labels for target graphs. Moreover, we develop a simple yet effective graph-mixing strategy named graph jigsaw to combine confident graphs and unconfident graphs, which can enhance generalization capabilities and robustness via consistency learning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of GALA.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Two-Player Performance Through Single-Player Knowledge Transfer: An Empirical Study on Atari 2600 Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Playing two-player games using reinforcement learning and self-play can be challenging due to the complexity of two-player environments and the possible instability in the training process. We propose that a reinforcement learning algorithm can train more efficiently and achieve improved performance in a two-player game if it leverages the knowledge from the single-player version of the same game. This study examines the proposed idea in ten different Atari 2600 environments using the Atari 2600 RAM as the input state. We discuss the advantages of using transfer learning from a single-player training process over training in a two-player setting from scratch, and demonstrate our results in a few measures such as training time and average total reward. We also discuss a method of calculating RAM complexity and its relationship to performance.</description>

      <title>Dual-Model Defense: Safeguarding Diffusion Models from Membership Inference Attacks through Disjoint Data Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image synthesis, but their recently proven vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) poses a critical privacy concern. This paper introduces two novel and efficient approaches (DualMD and DistillMD) to protect diffusion models against MIAs while maintaining high utility. Both methods are based on training two separate diffusion models on disjoint subsets of the original dataset. DualMD then employs a private inference pipeline that utilizes both models. This strategy significantly reduces the risk of black-box MIAs by limiting the information any single model contains about individual training samples. The dual models can also generate "soft targets" to train a private student model in DistillMD, enhancing privacy guarantees against all types of MIAs. Extensive evaluations of DualMD and DistillMD against state-of-the-art MIAs across various datasets in white-box and black-box settings demonstrate their effectiveness in substantially reducing MIA success rates while preserving competitive image generation performance. Notably, our experiments reveal that DistillMD not only defends against MIAs but also mitigates model memorization, indicating that both vulnerabilities stem from overfitting and can be addressed simultaneously with our unified approach.</description>

      <title>FastAttention: Extend FlashAttention2 to NPUs and Low-resource GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FlashAttention series has been widely applied in the inference of large language models (LLMs). However, FlashAttention series only supports the high-level GPU architectures, e.g., Ampere and Hopper. At present, FlashAttention series is not easily transferrable to NPUs and low-resource GPUs. Moreover, FlashAttention series is inefficient for multi- NPUs or GPUs inference scenarios. In this work, we propose FastAttention which pioneers the adaptation of FlashAttention series for NPUs and low-resource GPUs to boost LLM inference efficiency. Specifically, we take Ascend NPUs and Volta-based GPUs as representatives for designing our FastAttention. We migrate FlashAttention series to Ascend NPUs by proposing a novel two-level tiling strategy for runtime speedup, tiling-mask strategy for memory saving and the tiling-AllReduce strategy for reducing communication overhead, respectively. Besides, we adapt FlashAttention for Volta-based GPUs by redesigning the operands layout in shared memory and introducing a simple yet effective CPU-GPU cooperative strategy for efficient memory utilization. On Ascend NPUs, our FastAttention can achieve a 10.7$\times$ speedup compared to the standard attention implementation. Llama-7B within FastAttention reaches up to 5.16$\times$ higher throughput than within the standard attention. On Volta architecture GPUs, FastAttention yields 1.43$\times$ speedup compared to its equivalents in \texttt{xformers}. Pangu-38B within FastAttention brings 1.46$\times$ end-to-end speedup using FasterTransformer. Coupled with the propose CPU-GPU cooperative strategy, FastAttention supports a maximal input length of 256K on 8 V100 GPUs. All the codes will be made available soon.</description>

      <title>Linear Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gromov Wasserstein (GW) problem, a variant of the classical optimal transport (OT) problem, has attracted growing interest in the machine learning and data science communities due to its ability to quantify similarity between measures in different metric spaces. However, like the classical OT problem, GW imposes an equal mass constraint between measures, which restricts its application in many machine learning tasks. To address this limitation, the partial Gromov-Wasserstein (PGW) problem has been introduced, which relaxes the equal mass constraint, enabling the comparison of general positive Radon measures. Despite this, both GW and PGW face significant computational challenges due to their non-convex nature. To overcome these challenges, we propose the linear partial Gromov-Wasserstein (LPGW) embedding, a linearized embedding technique for the PGW problem. For $K$ different metric measure spaces, the pairwise computation of the PGW distance requires solving the PGW problem $\mathcal{O}(K^2)$ times. In contrast, the proposed linearization technique reduces this to $\mathcal{O}(K)$ times. Similar to the linearization technique for the classical OT problem, we prove that LPGW defines a valid metric for metric measure spaces. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of LPGW in practical applications such as shape retrieval and learning with transport-based embeddings, showing that LPGW preserves the advantages of PGW in partial matching while significantly enhancing computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>CoPS: Empowering LLM Agents with Provable Cross-Task Experience Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential reasoning in agent systems has been significantly advanced by large language models (LLMs), yet existing approaches face limitations. Reflection-driven reasoning relies solely on knowledge in pretrained models, limiting performance in novel scenarios, while experience-assisted reasoning often depends on external experiences and lacks clear principles for selecting representative experiences. We address these limitations by proposing CoPS (Cross-Task Experience Sharing), a generalizable algorithm that enhances sequential reasoning by cross-task experience sharing and selection. In detail, CoPS leverages agents' experiences on previous tasks, selecting distribution-matched experiences via a provable pessimism-based strategy to maximize utility while minimizing risks from distribution shifts. Extensive experimental results on benchmarks like Alfworld, Webshop, and HotPotQA demonstrate that CoPS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with superior sample efficiency suitable for resource-constrained scenarios. Theoretically, we show that the performance of our algorithm depends on both the quality of the pretrained LLM and the matching between the agent's task-dependent trial distribution and that generated by the LLM. Our work bridges the gap between existing sequential reasoning paradigms and validates the effectiveness of leveraging cross-task experiences, shedding light on the potential to improve agents' generalization and adaptability across diverse tasks.

      <title>Efficient Antibody Structure Refinement Using Energy-Guided SE(3) Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system that recognize and bind to specific antigens, and their 3D structures are crucial for understanding their binding mechanism and designing therapeutic interventions. The specificity of antibody-antigen binding predominantly depends on the complementarity-determining regions (CDR) within antibodies. Despite recent advancements in antibody structure prediction, the quality of predicted CDRs remains suboptimal. In this paper, we develop a novel antibody structure refinement method termed FlowAB based on energy-guided flow matching. FlowAB adopts the powerful deep generative method SE(3) flow matching and simultaneously incorporates important physical prior knowledge into the flow model to guide the generation process. The extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAB can significantly improve the antibody CDR structures. It achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the antibody structure prediction task when used in conjunction with an appropriate prior model while incurring only marginal computational overhead. This advantage makes FlowAB a practical tool in antibody engineering.</description>

      <title>Governing equation discovery of a complex system from snapshots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems in physics, chemistry, and biology that evolve over time with inherent randomness are typically described by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). A fundamental challenge in science and engineering is to determine the governing equations of a complex system from snapshot data. Traditional equation discovery methods often rely on stringent assumptions, such as the availability of the trajectory information or time-series data, and the presumption that the underlying system is deterministic. In this work, we introduce a data-driven, simulation-free framework, called Sparse Identification of Differential Equations from Snapshots (SpIDES), that discovers the governing equations of a complex system from snapshots by utilizing the advanced machine learning techniques to perform three essential steps: probability flow reconstruction, probability density estimation, and Bayesian sparse identification. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of SpIDES by successfully identifying the governing equation of an over-damped Langevin system confined within two potential wells. By extracting interpretable drift and diffusion terms from the SDEs, our framework provides deeper insights into system dynamics, enhances predictive accuracy, and facilitates more effective strategies for managing and simulating stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Hyperboloid GPLVM for Discovering Continuous Hierarchies via Nonparametric Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) offers a useful representation of complex high-dimensional data. Recent DR methods focus on hyperbolic geometry to derive a faithful low-dimensional representation of hierarchical data. However, existing methods are based on neighbor embedding, frequently ruining the continual relation of the hierarchies. This paper presents hyperboloid Gaussian process (GP) latent variable models (hGP-LVMs) to embed high-dimensional hierarchical data with implicit continuity via nonparametric estimation. We adopt generative modeling using the GP, which brings effective hierarchical embedding and executes ill-posed hyperparameter tuning. This paper presents three variants that employ original point, sparse point, and Bayesian estimations. We establish their learning algorithms by incorporating the Riemannian optimization and active approximation scheme of GP-LVM. For Bayesian inference, we further introduce the reparameterization trick to realize Bayesian latent variable learning. In the last part of this paper, we apply hGP-LVMs to several datasets and show their ability to represent high-dimensional hierarchies in low-dimensional spaces.</description>

      <title>Graph Transformers Dream of Electric Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show theoretically and empirically that the linear Transformer, when applied to graph data, can implement algorithms that solve canonical problems such as electric flow and eigenvector decomposition. The input to the Transformer is simply the graph incidence matrix; no other explicit positional encoding information is provided. We present explicit weight configurations for implementing each such graph algorithm, and we bound the errors of the constructed Transformers by the errors of the underlying algorithms. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by experiments on synthetic data. Additionally, on a real-world molecular regression task, we observe that the linear Transformer is capable of learning a more effective positional encoding than the default one based on Laplacian eigenvectors. Our work is an initial step towards elucidating the inner-workings of the Transformer for graph data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of foundation models in climate science has recently gained significant attention. However, a critical issue remains: the lack of a comprehensive evaluation framework capable of assessing the quality and scientific validity of model outputs. To address this issue, we develop ClimaGen (Climate QA Generator), an automated algorithmic framework that generates question-answer pairs from graduate textbooks with climate scientists in the loop. As a result, we present ClimaQA-Gold, an expert-annotated benchmark dataset alongside ClimaQA-Silver, a large-scale, comprehensive synthetic QA dataset for climate science. Finally, we develop evaluation strategies and compare different Large Language Models (LLMs) on our benchmarks. Our results offer novel insights into various approaches used to enhance climate foundation models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a universal approximation property of ODENet and ResNet. The ODENet is a map from an initial value to the final value of an ODE system in a finite interval. It is considered a mathematical model of a ResNet-type deep learning system. We consider dynamical systems with vector fields given by a single composition of the activation function and an affine mapping, which is the most common choice of the ODENet or ResNet vector field in actual machine learning systems. We show that such an ODENet and ResNet with a restricted vector field can uniformly approximate ODENet with a general vector field.</description>

      <title>Collapse or Thrive? Perils and Promises of Synthetic Data in a Self-Generating World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing presence of AI-generated content on the internet raises a critical question: What happens when generative machine learning models are pretrained on web-scale datasets containing data created by earlier models? Some authors prophesy $\textit{model collapse}$ under a "$\textit{replace}$" scenario: a sequence of models, the first trained with real data and each later one trained only on synthetic data from its preceding model. In this scenario, models successively degrade. Others see collapse as easily avoidable; in an "$\textit{accumulate}$' scenario, a sequence of models is trained, but each training uses all real and synthetic data generated so far. In this work, we deepen and extend the study of these contrasting scenarios. First, collapse versus avoidance of collapse is studied by comparing the replace and accumulate scenarios on each of three prominent generative modeling settings; we find the same contrast emerges in all three settings. Second, we study a compromise scenario; the available data remains the same as in the accumulate scenario -- but unlike $\textit{accumulate}$ and like $\textit{replace}$, each model is trained using a fixed compute budget; we demonstrate that model test loss on real data is larger than in the $\textit{accumulate}$ scenario, but apparently plateaus, unlike the divergence seen with $\textit{replace}$. Third, we study the relative importance of cardinality and proportion of real data for avoiding model collapse. Surprisingly, we find a non-trivial interaction between real and synthetic data, where the value of synthetic data for reducing test loss depends on the absolute quantity of real data. Our insights are particularly important when forecasting whether future frontier generative models will collapse or thrive, and our results open avenues for empirically and mathematically studying the context-dependent value of synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Optimal Partial Graph Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial graph matching addresses the limitations of traditional graph matching by allowing some nodes to remain unmatched, making it applicable to more complex scenarios. However, this flexibility introduces additional complexity, as both the subset of nodes to match and the optimal mapping must be determined. While recent studies have explored deep learning techniques for partial graph matching, a significant limitation remains: the absence of an optimization objective that fully captures the problem's intrinsic nature while enabling efficient solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization framework for partial graph matching, inspired by optimal partial transport. Our approach formulates an objective that enables partial assignments while incorporating matching biases, using weighted total variation as the divergence function to guarantee optimal partial assignments. We employ the Hungarian algorithm to achieve efficient, exact solutions with cubic time complexity. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we introduce a robust optimization objective that balances matched and unmatched nodes; (ii) we establish a connection between partial graph matching and the linear sum assignment problem, enabling efficient solutions; (iii) we propose a deep graph matching architecture with a novel partial matching loss, providing an end-to-end solution. The empirical evaluations on standard graph matching benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Interactive Residual Domain Adaptation Networks for Partial Transfer Industrial Fault Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The partial domain adaptation (PDA) challenge is a prevalent issue in industrial fault diagnosis. Current PDA approaches primarily rely on adversarial learning for domain adaptation and use reweighting strategies to exclude source samples deemed outliers. However, the transferability of features diminishes from general feature extraction layers to higher task-specific layers in adversarial learning-based adaptation modules, leading to significant negative transfer in PDA settings. We term this issue the adaptation-discrimination paradox (ADP). Furthermore, reweighting strategies often suffer from unreliable pseudo-labels, compromising their effectiveness. Drawing inspiration from traditional classification settings where such partial challenge is not a concern, we propose a novel PDA framework called Interactive Residual Domain Adaptation Networks (IRDAN), which introduces domain-wise models for each domain to provide a new perspective for the PDA challenge. Each domain-wise model is equipped with a residual domain adaptation (RDA) block to mitigate the ADP problem. Additionally, we introduce a confident information flow via an interactive learning strategy, training the modules of IRDAN sequentially to avoid cross-interference. We also establish a reliable stopping criterion for selecting the best-performing model, ensuring practical usability in real-world applications. Experiments have demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed IRDAN.</description>

      <title>LLM-Assisted Red Teaming of Diffusion Models through "Failures Are Fated, But Can Be Faded"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In large deep neural networks that seem to perform surprisingly well on many tasks, we also observe a few failures related to accuracy, social biases, and alignment with human values, among others. Therefore, before deploying these models, it is crucial to characterize this failure landscape for engineers to debug or audit models. Nevertheless, it is infeasible to exhaustively test for all possible combinations of factors that could lead to a model's failure. In this paper, we improve the "Failures are fated, but can be faded" framework (arXiv:2406.07145)--a post-hoc method to explore and construct the failure landscape in pre-trained generative models--with a variety of deep reinforcement learning algorithms, screening tests, and LLM-based rewards and state generation. With the aid of limited human feedback, we then demonstrate how to restructure the failure landscape to be more desirable by moving away from the discovered failure modes. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on diffusion models. We also highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm in identifying failure modes.</description>

      <title>Corrected Soft Actor Critic for Continuous Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm is known for its stability and high sample efficiency in deep reinforcement learning. However, the tanh transformation applied to sampled actions in SAC distorts the action distribution, hindering the selection of the most probable actions. This paper presents a novel action sampling method that directly identifies and selects the most probable actions within the transformed distribution, thereby addressing this issue. Extensive experiments on standard continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances SAC's performance, resulting in faster convergence and higher cumulative rewards compared to the original algorithm.</description>

      <title>Efficient Frequency Selective Surface Analysis via End-to-End Model-Based Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative end-to-end model-based deep learning approach for efficient electromagnetic analysis of high-dimensional frequency selective surfaces (FSS). Unlike traditional data-driven methods that require large datasets, this approach combines physical insights from equivalent circuit models with deep learning techniques to significantly reduce model complexity and enhance prediction accuracy. Compared to previously introduced model-based learning approaches, the proposed method is trained end-to-end from the physical structure of the FSS (geometric parameters) to its electromagnetic response (S-parameters). Additionally, an improvement in phase prediction accuracy through a modified loss function is presented. Comparisons with direct models, including deep neural networks (DNN) and radial basis function networks (RBFN), demonstrate the superiority of the model-based approach in terms of computational efficiency, model size, and generalization capability.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Curriculum Reinforcement Learning for Complex Reward Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise in control problems, but its practical application is often hindered by the complexity arising from intricate reward functions with constraints. While the reward hypothesis suggests these competing demands can be encapsulated in a single scalar reward function, designing such functions remains challenging. Building on existing work, we start by formulating preferences over trajectories to derive a realistic reward function that balances goal achievement with constraint satisfaction in the application of mobile robotics with dynamic obstacles. To mitigate reward exploitation in such complex settings, we propose a novel two-stage reward curriculum combined with a flexible replay buffer that adaptively samples experiences. Our approach first learns on a subset of rewards before transitioning to the full reward, allowing the agent to learn trade-offs between objectives and constraints. After transitioning to a new stage, our method continues to make use of past experiences by updating their rewards for sample-efficient learning. We investigate the efficacy of our approach in robot navigation tasks and demonstrate superior performance compared to baselines in terms of true reward achievement and task completion, underlining its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Test-time Adversarial Defense with Opposite Adversarial Path and High Attack Time Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks by injecting sophisticated designed perturbations to input data. Training-time defenses still exhibit a significant performance gap between natural accuracy and robust accuracy. In this paper, we investigate a new test-time adversarial defense method via diffusion-based recovery along opposite adversarial paths (OAPs). We present a purifier that can be plugged into a pre-trained model to resist adversarial attacks. Different from prior arts, the key idea is excessive denoising or purification by integrating the opposite adversarial direction with reverse diffusion to push the input image further toward the opposite adversarial direction. For the first time, we also exemplify the pitfall of conducting AutoAttack (Rand) for diffusion-based defense methods. Through the lens of time complexity, we examine the trade-off between the effectiveness of adaptive attack and its computation complexity against our defense. Experimental evaluation along with time cost analysis verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Masked Clinical Modelling: A Framework for Synthetic and Augmented Survival Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access to real clinical data is often restricted due to privacy obligations, creating significant barriers for healthcare research. Synthetic datasets provide a promising solution, enabling secure data sharing and model development. However, most existing approaches focus on data realism rather than utility -- ensuring that models trained on synthetic data yield clinically meaningful insights comparable to those trained on real data. In this paper, we present Masked Clinical Modelling (MCM), a framework inspired by masked language modelling, designed for both data synthesis and conditional data augmentation. We evaluate this prototype on the WHAS500 dataset using Cox Proportional Hazards models, focusing on the preservation of hazard ratios as key clinical metrics. Our results show that data generated using the MCM framework improves both discrimination and calibration in survival analysis, outperforming existing methods. MCM demonstrates strong potential to support survival data analysis and broader healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Klein Model for Hyperbolic Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic neural networks (HNNs) have been proved effective in modeling complex data structures. However, previous works mainly focused on the Poincar\'e ball model and the hyperboloid model as coordinate representations of the hyperbolic space, often neglecting the Klein model. Despite this, the Klein model offers its distinct advantages thanks to its straight-line geodesics, which facilitates the well-known Einstein midpoint construction, previously leveraged to accompany HNNs in other models. In this work, we introduce a framework for hyperbolic neural networks based on the Klein model. We provide detailed formulation for representing useful operations using the Klein model. We further study the Klein linear layer and prove that the "tangent space construction" of the scalar multiplication and parallel transport are exactly the Einstein scalar multiplication and the Einstein addition, analogous to the M\"obius operations used in the Poincar\'e ball model. We show numerically that the Klein HNN performs on par with the Poincar\'e ball model, providing a third option for HNN that works as a building block for more complicated architectures.</description>

      <title>Fast Graph Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Enhancing and Accelerating Few-Shot Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown superior performance in node classification. However, GNNs perform poorly in the Few-Shot Node Classification (FSNC) task that requires robust generalization to make accurate predictions for unseen classes with limited labels. To tackle the challenge, we propose the integration of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)--a technique designed to enhance model generalization by finding a flat minimum of the loss landscape--into GNN training. The standard SAM approach, however, consists of two forward-backward steps in each training iteration, doubling the computational cost compared to the base optimizer (e.g., Adam). To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a novel algorithm, Fast Graph Sharpness-Aware Minimization (FGSAM), that integrates the rapid training of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with the superior performance of GNNs. Specifically, we utilize GNNs for parameter perturbation while employing MLPs to minimize the perturbed loss so that we can find a flat minimum with good generalization more efficiently. Moreover, our method reutilizes the gradient from the perturbation phase to incorporate graph topology into the minimization process at almost zero additional cost. To further enhance training efficiency, we develop FGSAM+ that executes exact perturbations periodically. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the standard SAM with lower computational costs in FSNC tasks. In particular, our FGSAM+ as a SAM variant offers a faster optimization than the base optimizer in most cases. In addition to FSNC, our proposed methods also demonstrate competitive performance in the standard node classification task for heterophilic graphs, highlighting the broad applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/draym28/FGSAM_NeurIPS24.</description>

      <title>Rethinking generalization of classifiers in separable classes scenarios and over-parameterized regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the learning dynamics of classifiers in scenarios where classes are separable or classifiers are over-parameterized. In both cases, Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) results in zero training error. However, there are many global minima with a training error of zero, some of which generalize well and some of which do not. We show that in separable classes scenarios the proportion of "bad" global minima diminishes exponentially with the number of training data n. Our analysis provides bounds and learning curves dependent solely on the density distribution of the true error for the given classifier function set, irrespective of the set's size or complexity (e.g., number of parameters). This observation may shed light on the unexpectedly good generalization of over-parameterized Neural Networks. For the over-parameterized scenario, we propose a model for the density distribution of the true error, yielding learning curves that align with experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10.</description>

      <title>Error Feedback under $(L_0,L_1)$-Smoothness: Normalization and Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the first proof of convergence for normalized error feedback algorithms across a wide range of machine learning problems. Despite their popularity and efficiency in training deep neural networks, traditional analyses of error feedback algorithms rely on the smoothness assumption that does not capture the properties of objective functions in these problems. Rather, these problems have recently been shown to satisfy generalized smoothness assumptions, and the theoretical understanding of error feedback algorithms under these assumptions remains largely unexplored. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, all existing analyses under generalized smoothness either i) focus on single-node settings or ii) make unrealistically strong assumptions for distributed settings, such as requiring data heterogeneity, and almost surely bounded stochastic gradient noise variance. In this paper, we propose distributed error feedback algorithms that utilize normalization to achieve the $O(1/\sqrt{K})$ convergence rate for nonconvex problems under generalized smoothness. Our analyses apply for distributed settings without data heterogeneity conditions, and enable stepsize tuning that is independent of problem parameters. Additionally, we provide strong convergence guarantees of normalized error feedback algorithms for stochastic settings. Finally, we show that due to their larger allowable stepsizes, our new normalized error feedback algorithms outperform their non-normalized counterparts on various tasks, including the minimization of polynomial functions, logistic regression, and ResNet-20 training.</description>

      <title>CK4Gen: A Knowledge Distillation Framework for Generating High-Utility Synthetic Survival Datasets in Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access to real clinical data is heavily restricted by privacy regulations, hindering both healthcare research and education. These constraints slow progress in developing new treatments and data-driven healthcare solutions, while also limiting students' access to real-world datasets, leaving them without essential practical skills. High-utility synthetic datasets are therefore critical for advancing research and providing meaningful training material. However, current generative models -- such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- produce surface-level realism at the expense of healthcare utility, blending distinct patient profiles and producing synthetic data of limited practical relevance. To overcome these limitations, we introduce CK4Gen (Cox Knowledge for Generation), a novel framework that leverages knowledge distillation from Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) models to create synthetic survival datasets that preserve key clinical characteristics, including hazard ratios and survival curves. CK4Gen avoids the interpolation issues seen in VAEs and GANs by maintaining distinct patient risk profiles, ensuring realistic and reliable outputs for research and educational use. Validated across four benchmark datasets -- GBSG2, ACTG320, WHAS500, and FLChain -- CK4Gen outperforms competing techniques by better aligning real and synthetic data, enhancing survival model performance in both discrimination and calibration via data augmentation. As CK4Gen is scalable across clinical conditions, and with code to be made publicly available, future researchers can apply it to their own datasets to generate synthetic versions suitable for open sharing.</description>

Abstract: Precise energy load forecasting in residential households is crucial for mitigating carbon emissions and enhancing energy efficiency; indeed, accurate forecasting enables utility companies and policymakers, who advocate sustainable energy practices, to optimize resource utilization. Moreover, smart meters provide valuable information by allowing for granular insights into consumption patterns. Building upon available smart meter data, our study aims to cluster consumers into distinct groups according to their energy usage behaviours, effectively capturing a diverse spectrum of consumption patterns. Next, we design JITtrans (Just In Time transformer), a novel transformer deep learning model that significantly improves energy consumption forecasting accuracy, with respect to traditional forecasting methods. Extensive experimental results validate our claims using proprietary smart meter data. Our findings highlight the potential of advanced predictive technologies to revolutionize energy management and advance sustainable power systems: the development of efficient and eco-friendly energy solutions critically depends on such technologies.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Time Series Anomaly Prediction with Importance-based Generative Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series anomaly prediction plays an essential role in many real-world scenarios, such as environmental prevention and prompt maintenance of cyber-physical systems. However, existing time series anomaly prediction methods mainly require supervised training with plenty of manually labeled data, which are difficult to obtain in practice. Besides, unseen anomalies can occur during inference, which could differ from the labeled training data and make these models fail to predict such new anomalies. In this paper, we study a novel problem of unsupervised time series anomaly prediction. We provide a theoretical analysis and propose Importance-based Generative Contrastive Learning (IGCL) to address the aforementioned problems. IGCL distinguishes between normal and anomaly precursors, which are generated by our anomaly precursor pattern generation module. To address the efficiency issues caused by the potential complex anomaly precursor combinations, we propose a memory bank with importance-based scores to adaptively store representative anomaly precursors and generate more complicated anomaly precursors. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on unsupervised time series anomaly prediction problems.</description>

      <title>Bayes without Underfitting: Fully Correlated Deep Learning Posteriors via Alternating Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian deep learning all too often underfits so that the Bayesian prediction is less accurate than a simple point estimate. Uncertainty quantification then comes at the cost of accuracy. For linearized models, the null space of the generalized Gauss-Newton matrix corresponds to parameters that preserve the training predictions of the point estimate. We propose to build Bayesian approximations in this null space, thereby guaranteeing that the Bayesian predictive does not underfit. We suggest a matrix-free algorithm for projecting onto this null space, which scales linearly with the number of parameters and quadratically with the number of output dimensions. We further propose an approximation that only scales linearly with parameters to make the method applicable to generative models. An extensive empirical evaluation shows that the approach scales to large models, including vision transformers with 28 million parameters.</description>

      <title>Pyramid Vector Quantization for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works on compression of large language models (LLM) using quantization considered reparameterizing the architecture such that weights are distributed on the sphere. This demonstratively improves the ability to quantize by increasing the mathematical notion of coherence, resulting in fewer weight outliers without affecting the network output. In this work, we aim to further exploit this spherical geometry of the weights when performing quantization by considering Pyramid Vector Quantization (PVQ) for large language models. Arranging points evenly on the sphere is notoriously difficult, especially in high dimensions, and in case approximate solutions exists, representing points explicitly in a codebook is typically not feasible due to its additional memory cost. Instead, PVQ uses a fixed integer lattice on the sphere by projecting points onto the 1-sphere, which allows for efficient encoding and decoding without requiring an explicit codebook in memory. To obtain a practical algorithm, we propose to combine PVQ with scale quantization for which we derive theoretically optimal quantizations, under empirically verified assumptions. Further, we extend pyramid vector quantization to use Hessian information to minimize quantization error under expected feature activations, instead of only relying on weight magnitudes. Experimentally, we achieves state-of-the-art quantization performance with pareto-optimal trade-off between performance and bits per weight and bits per activation, compared to compared methods. On weight-only, we find that we can quantize a Llama-3 70B model to 3.25 bits per weight and retain 98\% accuracy on downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>xLSTM-Mixer: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting by Mixing via Scalar Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series data is prevalent across numerous fields, necessitating the development of robust and accurate forecasting models. Capturing patterns both within and between temporal and multivariate components is crucial for reliable predictions. We introduce xLSTM-Mixer, a model designed to effectively integrate temporal sequences, joint time-variate information, and multiple perspectives for robust forecasting. Our approach begins with a linear forecast shared across variates, which is then refined by xLSTM blocks. These blocks serve as key elements for modeling the complex dynamics of challenging time series data. xLSTM-Mixer ultimately reconciles two distinct views to produce the final forecast. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate xLSTM-Mixer's superior long-term forecasting performance compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. A thorough model analysis provides further insights into its key components and confirms its robustness and effectiveness. This work contributes to the resurgence of recurrent models in time series forecasting.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Edge Signals: Orientation Equivariance and Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many applications in traffic, civil engineering, or electrical engineering revolve around edge-level signals. Such signals can be categorized as inherently directed, for example, the water flow in a pipe network, and undirected, like the diameter of a pipe. Topological methods model edge signals with inherent direction by representing them relative to a so-called orientation assigned to each edge. These approaches can neither model undirected edge signals nor distinguish if an edge itself is directed or undirected. We address these shortcomings by (i) revising the notion of orientation equivariance to enable edge direction-aware topological models, (ii) proposing orientation invariance as an additional requirement to describe signals without inherent direction, and (iii) developing EIGN, an architecture composed of novel direction-aware edge-level graph shift operators, that provably fulfills the aforementioned desiderata. It is the first general-purpose topological GNN for edge-level signals that can model directed and undirected signals while distinguishing between directed and undirected edges. A comprehensive evaluation shows that EIGN outperforms prior work in edge-level tasks, for example, improving in RMSE on flow simulation tasks by up to 43.5%.</description>

      <title>Business Process Simulation: Probabilistic Modeling of Intermittent Resource Availability and Multitasking Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In business process simulation, resource availability is typically modeled by assigning a calendar to each resource, e.g., Monday-Friday, 9:00-18:00. Resources are assumed to be always available during each time slot in their availability calendar. This assumption often becomes invalid due to interruptions, breaks, or time-sharing across processes. In other words, existing approaches fail to capture intermittent availability. Another limitation of existing approaches is that they either do not consider multitasking behavior, or if they do, they assume that resources always multitask (up to a maximum capacity) whenever available. However, studies have shown that the multitasking patterns vary across days. This paper introduces a probabilistic approach to model resource availability and multitasking behavior for business process simulation. In this approach, each time slot in a resource calendar has an associated availability probability and a multitasking probability per multitasking level. For example, a resource may be available on Fridays between 14:00-15:00 with 90\% probability, and given that they are performing one task during this slot, they may take on a second concurrent task with 60\% probability. We propose algorithms to discover probabilistic calendars and probabilistic multitasking capacities from event logs. An evaluation shows that, with these enhancements, simulation models discovered from event logs better replicate the distribution of activities and cycle times, relative to approaches with crisp calendars and monotasking assumptions.</description>

      <title>Sample-efficient Bayesian Optimisation Using Known Invariances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimisation (BO) is a powerful framework for global optimisation of costly functions, using predictions from Gaussian process models (GPs). In this work, we apply BO to functions that exhibit invariance to a known group of transformations. We show that vanilla and constrained BO algorithms are inefficient when optimising such invariant objectives, and provide a method for incorporating group invariances into the kernel of the GP to produce invariance-aware algorithms that achieve significant improvements in sample efficiency. We derive a bound on the maximum information gain of these invariant kernels, and provide novel upper and lower bounds on the number of observations required for invariance-aware BO algorithms to achieve $\epsilon$-optimality. We demonstrate our method's improved performance on a range of synthetic invariant and quasi-invariant functions. We also apply our method in the case where only some of the invariance is incorporated into the kernel, and find that these kernels achieve similar gains in sample efficiency at significantly reduced computational cost. Finally, we use invariant BO to design a current drive system for a nuclear fusion reactor, finding a high-performance solution where non-invariant methods failed.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Geometry Reconstruction from Euclidean Distances using Non-Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of finding suitable point embedding or geometric configurations given only Euclidean distance information of point pairs arises both as a core task and as a sub-problem in a variety of machine learning applications. In this paper, we aim to solve this problem given a minimal number of distance samples. To this end, we leverage continuous and non-convex rank minimization formulations of the problem and establish a local convergence guarantee for a variant of iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS), which applies if a minimal random set of observed distances is provided. As a technical tool, we establish a restricted isometry property (RIP) restricted to a tangent space of the manifold of symmetric rank-$r$ matrices given random Euclidean distance measurements, which might be of independent interest for the analysis of other non-convex approaches. Furthermore, we assess data efficiency, scalability and generalizability of different reconstruction algorithms through numerical experiments with simulated data as well as real-world data, demonstrating the proposed algorithm's ability to identify the underlying geometry from fewer distance samples compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>LFME: A Simple Framework for Learning from Multiple Experts in Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) methods aim to maintain good performance in an unseen target domain by using training data from multiple source domains. While success on certain occasions are observed, enhancing the baseline across most scenarios remains challenging. This work introduces a simple yet effective framework, dubbed learning from multiple experts (LFME), that aims to make the target model an expert in all source domains to improve DG. Specifically, besides learning the target model used in inference, LFME will also train multiple experts specialized in different domains, whose output probabilities provide professional guidance by simply regularizing the logit of the target model. Delving deep into the framework, we reveal that the introduced logit regularization term implicitly provides effects of enabling the target model to harness more information, and mining hard samples from the experts during training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks from different DG tasks demonstrate that LFME is consistently beneficial to the baseline and can achieve comparable performance to existing arts. Code is available at~\url{https://github.com/liangchen527/LFME}.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Mixture-of-Experts Inference Time Combining Model Deployment and Communication Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As machine learning models scale in size and complexity, their computational requirements become a significant barrier. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models alleviate this issue by selectively activating relevant experts. Despite this, MoE models are hindered by high communication overhead from all-to-all operations, low GPU utilization due to the synchronous communication constraint, and complications from heterogeneous GPU environments.
  This paper presents Aurora, which optimizes both model deployment and all-to-all communication scheduling to address these challenges in MoE inference. Aurora achieves minimal communication times by strategically ordering token transmissions in all-to-all communications. It improves GPU utilization by colocating experts from different models on the same device, avoiding the limitations of synchronous all-to-all communication. We analyze Aurora's optimization strategies theoretically across four common GPU cluster settings: exclusive vs. colocated models on GPUs, and homogeneous vs. heterogeneous GPUs. Aurora provides optimal solutions for three cases, and for the remaining NP-hard scenario, it offers a polynomial-time sub-optimal solution with only a 1.07x degradation from the optimal.
  Aurora is the first approach to minimize MoE inference time via optimal model deployment and communication scheduling across various scenarios. Evaluations demonstrate that Aurora significantly accelerates inference, achieving speedups of up to 2.38x in homogeneous clusters and 3.54x in heterogeneous environments. Moreover, Aurora enhances GPU utilization by up to 1.5x compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>UnStar: Unlearning with Self-Taught Anti-Sample Reasoning for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key components of machine learning are data samples for training, model for learning patterns, and loss function for optimizing accuracy. Analogously, unlearning can potentially be achieved through anti-data samples (or anti-samples), unlearning method, and reversed loss function. While prior research has explored unlearning methods and reversed loss functions, the potential of anti-samples remains largely untapped. In this paper, we introduce UnSTAR: Unlearning with Self-Taught Anti-Sample Reasoning for large language models (LLMs). Our contributions are threefold; first, we propose a novel concept of anti-sample-induced unlearning; second, we generate anti-samples by leveraging misleading rationales, which help reverse learned associations and accelerate the unlearning process; and third, we enable fine-grained targeted unlearning, allowing for the selective removal of specific associations without impacting related knowledge - something not achievable by previous works. Results demonstrate that anti-samples offer an efficient, targeted unlearning strategy for LLMs, opening new avenues for privacy-preserving machine learning and model modification.</description>

      <title>Optimal Design for Reward Modeling in RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a popular approach to align language models (LMs) with human preferences. This method involves collecting a large dataset of human pairwise preferences across various text generations and using it to infer (implicitly or explicitly) a reward model. Numerous methods have been proposed to learn the reward model and align a LM with it. However, the costly process of collecting human preferences has received little attention and could benefit from theoretical insights. This paper addresses this issue and aims to formalize the reward training model in RLHF. We frame the selection of an effective dataset as a simple regret minimization task, using a linear contextual dueling bandit method. Given the potentially large number of arms, this approach is more coherent than the best-arm identification setting. We then propose an offline framework for solving this problem. Under appropriate assumptions - linearity of the reward model in the embedding space, and boundedness of the reward parameter - we derive bounds on the simple regret. Finally, we provide a lower bound that matches our upper bound up to constant and logarithmic terms. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical contribution in this area to provide an offline approach as well as worst-case guarantees.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Logistic Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework called combinatorial logistic bandits (CLogB), where in each round, a subset of base arms (called the super arm) is selected, with the outcome of each base arm being binary and its expectation following a logistic parametric model. The feedback is governed by a general arm triggering process. Our study covers CLogB with reward functions satisfying two smoothness conditions, capturing application scenarios such as online content delivery, online learning to rank, and dynamic channel allocation. We first propose a simple yet efficient algorithm, CLogUCB, utilizing a variance-agnostic exploration bonus. Under the 1-norm triggering probability modulated (TPM) smoothness condition, CLogUCB achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{\kappa KT})$, where $\tilde{O}$ ignores logarithmic factors, $d$ is the dimension of the feature vector, $\kappa$ represents the nonlinearity of the logistic model, and $K$ is the maximum number of base arms a super arm can trigger. This result improves on prior work by a factor of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\kappa})$. We then enhance CLogUCB with a variance-adaptive version, VA-CLogUCB, which attains a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{KT})$ under the same 1-norm TPM condition, improving another $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\kappa})$ factor. VA-CLogUCB shows even greater promise under the stronger triggering probability and variance modulated (TPVM) condition, achieving a leading $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$ regret, thus removing the additional dependency on the action-size $K$. Furthermore, we enhance the computational efficiency of VA-CLogUCB by eliminating the nonconvex optimization process when the context feature map is time-invariant while maintaining the tight $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$ regret. Finally, experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithms compared to benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>Learning Load Balancing with GNN in MPTCP-Enabled Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks are a promising paradigm of heterogeneous network (HetNet), attributed to the complementary physical properties of optical spectra and radio frequency. However, the current development of such HetNets is mostly bottlenecked by the existing transmission control protocol (TCP), which restricts the user equipment (UE) to connecting one access point (AP) at a time. While the ongoing investigation on multipath TCP (MPTCP) can bring significant benefits, it complicates the network topology of HetNets, making the existing load balancing (LB) learning models less effective. Driven by this, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based model to tackle the LB problem for MPTCP-enabled HetNets, which results in a partial mesh topology. Such a topology can be modeled as a graph, with the channel state information and data rate requirement embedded as node features, while the LB solutions are deemed as edge labels. Compared to the conventional deep neural network (DNN), the proposed GNN-based model exhibits two key strengths: i) it can better interpret a complex network topology; and ii) it can handle various numbers of APs and UEs with a single trained model. Simulation results show that against the traditional optimisation method, the proposed learning model can achieve near-optimal throughput within a gap of 11.5%, while reducing the inference time by 4 orders of magnitude. In contrast to the DNN model, the new method can improve the network throughput by up to 21.7%, at a similar inference time level.</description>

      <title>LiNeS: Post-training Layer Scaling Prevents Forgetting and Enhances Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large pre-trained models exhibit impressive zero-shot performance across diverse tasks, but fine-tuning often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where improvements on a target domain degrade generalization on other tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce LiNeS, Layer-increasing Network Scaling, a post-training editing technique designed to preserve pre-trained generalization while enhancing fine-tuned task performance. LiNeS scales parameter updates linearly based on their layer depth within the network, maintaining shallow layers close to their pre-trained values to preserve general features while allowing deeper layers to retain task-specific representations. We further extend this approach to multi-task model merging scenarios, where layer-wise scaling of merged parameters reduces negative task interference. LiNeS demonstrates significant improvements in both single-task and multi-task settings across various benchmarks in vision and natural language processing. It mitigates forgetting, enhances out-of-distribution generalization, integrates seamlessly with existing multi-task model merging baselines improving their performance across benchmarks and model sizes, and can boost generalization when merging LLM policies aligned with different rewards via RLHF. Importantly, our method is simple to implement and complementary to many existing techniques.</description>

      <title>LiNo: Advancing Recursive Residual Decomposition of Linear and Nonlinear Patterns for Robust Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting models are pivotal in a data-driven world with vast volumes of time series data that appear as a compound of vast Linear and Nonlinear patterns. Recent deep time series forecasting models struggle to utilize seasonal and trend decomposition to separate the entangled components. Such a strategy only explicitly extracts simple linear patterns like trends, leaving the other linear modes and vast unexplored nonlinear patterns to the residual. Their flawed linear and nonlinear feature extraction models and shallow-level decomposition limit their adaptation to the diverse patterns present in real-world scenarios. Given this, we innovate Recursive Residual Decomposition by introducing explicit extraction of both linear and nonlinear patterns. This deeper-level decomposition framework, which is named LiNo, captures linear patterns using a Li block which can be a moving average kernel, and models nonlinear patterns using a No block which can be a Transformer encoder. The extraction of these two patterns is performed alternatively and recursively. To achieve the full potential of LiNo, we develop the current simple linear pattern extractor to a general learnable autoregressive model, and design a novel No block that can handle all essential nonlinear patterns. Remarkably, the proposed LiNo achieves state-of-the-art on thirteen real-world benchmarks under univariate and multivariate forecasting scenarios. Experiments show that current forecasting models can deliver more robust and precise results through this advanced Recursive Residual Decomposition. We hope this work could offer insight into designing more effective forecasting models. Code is available at this Repository: https://github.com/Levi-Ackman/LiNo.</description>

      <title>On Functional Dimension and Persistent Pseudodimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any fixed feedforward ReLU neural network architecture, it is well-known that many different parameter settings can determine the same function. It is less well-known that the degree of this redundancy is inhomogeneous across parameter space. In this work, we discuss two locally applicable complexity measures for ReLU network classes and what we know about the relationship between them: (1) the local functional dimension [14, 18], and (2) a local version of VC dimension that we call persistent pseudodimension. The former is easy to compute on finite batches of points; the latter should give local bounds on the generalization gap, which would inform an understanding of the mechanics of the double descent phenomenon [7].</description>

Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) algorithms alter models' internal weights to perform targeted updates to incorrect, outdated, or otherwise unwanted factual associations. In order to better define the possibilities and limitations of these approaches, recent work has shown that applying KE can adversely affect models' factual recall accuracy and diminish their general reasoning abilities. While these studies give broad insights into the potential harms of KE algorithms, e.g., via performance evaluations on benchmarks, we argue little is understood as to why such destructive failures occur. Is it possible KE methods distort representations of concepts beyond the targeted fact, hence hampering abilities at broad? If so, what is the extent of this distortion? To take a step towards addressing such questions, we define a novel synthetic task wherein a Transformer is trained from scratch to internalize a ``structured'' knowledge graph. The structure enforces relationships between entities of the graph, such that editing a factual association has "trickling effects" on other entities in the graph (e.g., altering X's parent is Y to Z affects who X's siblings' parent is). Through evaluations of edited models and analysis of extracted representations, we show that KE inadvertently affects representations of entities beyond the targeted one, distorting relevant structures that allow a model to infer unseen knowledge about an entity. We call this phenomenon representation shattering and demonstrate that it results in degradation of factual recall and reasoning performance more broadly. To corroborate our findings in a more naturalistic setup, we perform preliminary experiments with a pretrained GPT-2-XL model and reproduce the representation shattering effect therein as well. Overall, our work yields a precise mechanistic hypothesis to explain why KE has adverse effects on model capabilities.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Upper Confidence Bounds for Constrained Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is a foundational framework in sequential decision-making under uncertainty, extensively studied for its applications in areas such as clinical trials, online advertising, and resource allocation. Traditional MAB formulations, however, do not adequately capture scenarios where decisions are structured hierarchically, involve multi-level constraints, or feature context-dependent action spaces. In this paper, we introduce the hierarchical constrained bandits (HCB) framework, which extends the contextual bandit problem to incorporate hierarchical decision structures and multi-level constraints. We propose the hierarchical constrained upper confidence bound (HC-UCB) algorithm, designed to address the complexities of the HCB problem by leveraging confidence bounds within a hierarchical setting. Our theoretical analysis establishes sublinear regret bounds for HC-UCB and provides high-probability guarantees for constraint satisfaction at all hierarchical levels. Furthermore, we derive a minimax lower bound on the regret for the HCB problem, demonstrating the near-optimality of our algorithm. The results are significant for real-world applications where decision-making processes are inherently hierarchical and constrained, offering a robust and efficient solution that balances exploration and exploitation across multiple levels of decision-making.</description>

      <title>On Uncertainty In Natural Language Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last decade in deep learning has brought on increasingly capable systems that are deployed on a wide variety of applications. In natural language processing, the field has been transformed by a number of breakthroughs including large language models, which are used in increasingly many user-facing applications. In order to reap the benefits of this technology and reduce potential harms, it is important to quantify the reliability of model predictions and the uncertainties that shroud their development.
  This thesis studies how uncertainty in natural language processing can be characterized from a linguistic, statistical and neural perspective, and how it can be reduced and quantified through the design of the experimental pipeline. We further explore uncertainty quantification in modeling by theoretically and empirically investigating the effect of inductive model biases in text classification tasks. The corresponding experiments include data for three different languages (Danish, English and Finnish) and tasks as well as a large set of different uncertainty quantification approaches. Additionally, we propose a method for calibrated sampling in natural language generation based on non-exchangeable conformal prediction, which provides tighter token sets with better coverage of the actual continuation. Lastly, we develop an approach to quantify confidence in large black-box language models using auxiliary predictors, where the confidence is predicted from the input to and generated output text of the target model alone.</description>

      <title>On Creating an English-Thai Code-switched Machine Translation in Medical Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine translation (MT) in the medical domain plays a pivotal role in enhancing healthcare quality and disseminating medical knowledge. Despite advancements in English-Thai MT technology, common MT approaches often underperform in the medical field due to their inability to precisely translate medical terminologies. Our research prioritizes not merely improving translation accuracy but also maintaining medical terminology in English within the translated text through code-switched (CS) translation. We developed a method to produce CS medical translation data, fine-tuned a CS translation model with this data, and evaluated its performance against strong baselines, such as Google Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and GPT-3.5/GPT-4. Our model demonstrated competitive performance in automatic metrics and was highly favored in human preference evaluations. Our evaluation result also shows that medical professionals significantly prefer CS translations that maintain critical English terms accurately, even if it slightly compromises fluency. Our code and test set are publicly available https://github.com/preceptorai-org/NLLB_CS_EM_NLP2024.</description>

      <title>Verification of Neural Control Barrier Functions with Symbolic Derivative Bounds Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are important in safety-critical systems and robot control applications. Neural networks have been used to parameterize and synthesize CBFs with bounded control input for complex systems. However, it is still challenging to verify pre-trained neural networks CBFs (neural CBFs) in an efficient symbolic manner. To this end, we propose a new efficient verification framework for ReLU-based neural CBFs through symbolic derivative bound propagation by combining the linearly bounded nonlinear dynamic system and the gradient bounds of neural CBFs. Specifically, with Heaviside step function form for derivatives of activation functions, we show that the symbolic bounds can be propagated through the inner product of neural CBF Jacobian and nonlinear system dynamics. Through extensive experiments on different robot dynamics, our results outperform the interval arithmetic based baselines in verified rate and verification time along the CBF boundary, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method with different model complexity. The code can be found at https://github.com/intelligent-control-lab/ verify-neural-CBF.</description>

      <title>Hawk: An Efficient NALM System for Accurate Low-Power Appliance Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-intrusive Appliance Load Monitoring (NALM) aims to recognize individual appliance usage from the main meter without indoor sensors. However, existing systems struggle to balance dataset construction efficiency and event/state recognition accuracy, especially for low-power appliance recognition. This paper introduces Hawk, an efficient and accurate NALM system that operates in two stages: dataset construction and event recognition. In the data construction stage, we efficiently collect a balanced and diverse dataset, HawkDATA, based on balanced Gray code and enable automatic data annotations via a sampling synchronization strategy called shared perceptible time. During the event recognition stage, our algorithm integrates steady-state differential pre-processing and voting-based post-processing for accurate event recognition from the aggregate current. Experimental results show that HawkDATA takes only 1/71.5 of the collection time to collect 6.34x more appliance state combinations than the baseline. In HawkDATA and a widely used dataset, Hawk achieves an average F1 score of 93.94% for state recognition and 97.07% for event recognition, which is a 47. 98% and 11. 57% increase over SOTA algorithms. Furthermore, selected appliance subsets and the model trained from HawkDATA are deployed in two real-world scenarios with many unknown background appliances. The average F1 scores of event recognition are 96.02% and 94.76%. Hawk's source code and HawkDATA are accessible at https://github.com/WZiJ/SenSys24-Hawk.</description>

      <title>Identification of Mean-Field Dynamics using Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of transformer architectures to approximate the mean-field dynamics of interacting particle systems exhibiting collective behavior. Such systems are fundamental in modeling phenomena across physics, biology, and engineering, including gas dynamics, opinion formation, biological networks, and swarm robotics. The key characteristic of these systems is that the particles are indistinguishable, leading to permutation-equivariant dynamics. We demonstrate that transformers, which inherently possess permutation equivariance, are well-suited for approximating these dynamics. Specifically, we prove that if a finite-dimensional transformer can effectively approximate the finite-dimensional vector field governing the particle system, then the expected output of this transformer provides a good approximation for the infinite-dimensional mean-field vector field. Leveraging this result, we establish theoretical bounds on the distance between the true mean-field dynamics and those obtained using the transformer. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations on the Cucker-Smale model for flocking, and the mean-field system for training two-layer neural networks.</description>

      <title>Computational design of target-specific linear peptide binders with TransformerBeta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational prediction and design of peptide binders targeting specific linear epitopes is crucial in biological and biomedical research, yet it remains challenging due to their highly dynamic nature and the scarcity of experimentally solved binding data. To address this problem, we built an unprecedentedly large-scale library of peptide pairs within stable secondary structures (beta sheets), leveraging newly available AlphaFold predicted structures. We then developed a machine learning method based on the Transformer architecture for the design of specific linear binders, in analogy to a language translation task. Our method, TransformerBeta, accurately predicts specific beta strand interactions and samples sequences with beta sheet-like molecular properties, while capturing interpretable physico-chemical interaction patterns. As such, it can propose specific candidate binders targeting linear epitope for experimental validation to inform protein design.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal 3D Point Clouds from WiFi-CSI Data via Transformer Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint communication and sensing (JC\&amp;S) is emerging as a key component in 5G and 6G networks, enabling dynamic adaptation to environmental changes and enhancing contextual awareness for optimized communication. By leveraging real-time environmental data, JC\&amp;S improves resource allocation, reduces latency, and enhances power efficiency, while also supporting simulations and predictive modeling. This makes it a key technology for reactive systems and digital twins. These systems can respond to environmental events in real-time, offering transformative potential in sectors like smart cities, healthcare, and Industry 5.0, where adaptive and multimodal interaction is critical to enhance real-time decision-making. In this work, we present a transformer-based architecture that processes temporal Channel State Information (CSI) data, specifically amplitude and phase, to generate 3D point clouds of indoor environments. The model utilizes a multi-head attention to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships in CSI data and is adaptable to different CSI configurations. We evaluate the architecture on the MM-Fi dataset, using two different protocols to capture human presence in indoor environments. The system demonstrates strong potential for accurate 3D reconstructions and effectively distinguishes between close and distant objects, advancing JC\&amp;S applications for spatial sensing in future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Steering Large Language Models using Conceptors: Improving Addition-Based Activation Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have transformed AI, yet reliably controlling their outputs remains a challenge. This paper explores activation engineering, where outputs of pre-trained LLMs are controlled by manipulating their activations at inference time. Unlike traditional methods using a single steering vector, we introduce conceptors - mathematical constructs that represent sets of activation vectors as ellipsoidal regions. Conceptors act as soft projection matrices and offer more precise control over complex activation patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that conceptors outperform traditional methods across multiple in-context learning steering tasks. We further use Boolean operations on conceptors that allows for combined steering goals that empirically outperforms combining steering vectors on a set of tasks. These results highlight conceptors as a promising tool for more effective steering of LLMs.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Physical Adversarial Attacks against Face Recognition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Face Recognition (FR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent in finance, the military, public safety, and everyday life, security concerns have grown substantially. Physical adversarial attacks targeting FR systems in real-world settings have attracted considerable research interest due to their practicality and the severe threats they pose. However, a systematic overview focused on physical adversarial attacks against FR systems is still lacking, hindering an in-depth exploration of the challenges and future directions in this field. In this paper, we bridge this gap by comprehensively collecting and analyzing physical adversarial attack methods targeting FR systems. Specifically, we first investigate the key challenges of physical attacks on FR systems. We then categorize existing physical attacks into three categories based on the physical medium used and summarize how the research in each category has evolved to address these challenges. Furthermore, we review current defense strategies and discuss potential future research directions. Our goal is to provide a fresh, comprehensive, and deep understanding of physical adversarial attacks against FR systems, thereby inspiring relevant research in this area.</description>

      <title>Exploring Quantum Neural Networks for Demand Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting demand for assets and services can be addressed in various markets, providing a competitive advantage when the predictive models used demonstrate high accuracy. However, the training of machine learning models incurs high computational costs, which may limit the training of prediction models based on available computational capacity. In this context, this paper presents an approach for training demand prediction models using quantum neural networks. For this purpose, a quantum neural network was used to forecast demand for vehicle financing. A classical recurrent neural network was used to compare the results, and they show a similar predictive capacity between the classical and quantum models, with the advantage of using a lower number of training parameters and also converging in fewer steps. Utilizing quantum computing techniques offers a promising solution to overcome the limitations of traditional machine learning approaches in training predictive models for complex market dynamics.</description>

      <title>Conformal Predictive Portfolio Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores portfolio selection using predictive models for portfolio returns. Portfolio selection is a fundamental task in finance, and various methods have been developed to achieve this goal. For example, the mean-variance approach constructs portfolios by balancing the trade-off between the mean and variance of asset returns, while the quantile-based approach optimizes portfolios by accounting for tail risk. These traditional methods often rely on distributional information estimated from historical data. However, a key concern is the uncertainty of future portfolio returns, which may not be fully captured by simple reliance on historical data, such as using the sample average. To address this, we propose a framework for predictive portfolio selection using conformal inference, called Conformal Predictive Portfolio Selection (CPPS). Our approach predicts future portfolio returns, computes corresponding prediction intervals, and selects the desirable portfolio based on these intervals. The framework is flexible and can accommodate a variety of predictive models, including autoregressive (AR) models, random forests, and neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our CPPS framework using an AR model and validate its performance through empirical studies, showing that it provides superior returns compared to simpler strategies.</description>

      <title>Advancing Gasoline Consumption Forecasting: A Novel Hybrid Model Integrating Transformers, LSTM, and CNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iran, endowed with abundant hydrocarbon resources, plays a crucial role in the global energy landscape. Gasoline, as a critical fuel, significantly supports the nation's transportation sector. Accurate forecasting of gasoline consumption is essential for strategic resource management and environmental planning. This research introduces a novel approach to predicting monthly gasoline consumption using a hybrid Transformer-LSTM-CNN model, which integrates the strengths of Transformer networks, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This advanced architecture offers a superior alternative to conventional methods such as artificial neural networks and regression models by capturing both short- and long-term dependencies in time series data. By leveraging the self-attention mechanism of Transformers, the temporal memory of LSTMs, and the local pattern detection of CNNs, our hybrid model delivers improved prediction accuracy. Implemented using Python, the model provides precise future gasoline consumption forecasts and evaluates the environmental impact through the analysis of greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines gasoline consumption trends from 2007 to 2021, which rose from 64.5 million liters per day in 2007 to 99.80 million liters per day in 2021. Our proposed model forecasts consumption levels up to 2031, offering a valuable tool for policymakers and energy analysts. The results highlight the superiority of this hybrid model in improving the accuracy of gasoline consumption forecasts, reinforcing the need for advanced machine learning techniques to optimize resource management and mitigate environmental risks in the energy sector.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent is a classic algorithm that has gained great popularity especially in the last decades as the most common approach for training models in machine learning. While the algorithm has been well-studied when stochastic gradients are assumed to have a finite variance, there is significantly less research addressing its theoretical properties in the case of infinite variance gradients. In this paper, we establish the asymptotic behavior of stochastic gradient descent in the context of infinite variance stochastic gradients, assuming that the stochastic gradient is regular varying with index $\alpha\in(1,2)$. The closest result in this context was established in 1969 , in the one-dimensional case and assuming that stochastic gradients belong to a more restrictive class of distributions. We extend it to the multidimensional case, covering a broader class of infinite variance distributions. As we show, the asymptotic distribution of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm can be characterized as the stationary distribution of a suitably defined Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process driven by an appropriate stable L\'evy process. Additionally, we explore the applications of these results in linear regression and logistic regression models.</description>

      <title>Vulnerabilities in Machine Learning-Based Voice Disorder Detection Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of voice disorders is becoming more widely acknowledged as a public health issue. Several machine learning-based classifiers with the potential to identify disorders have been used in recent studies to differentiate between normal and pathological voices and sounds. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the vulnerabilities of these systems by exploring the possibility of attacks that can reverse classification and compromise their reliability. Given the critical nature of personal health information, understanding which types of attacks are effective is a necessary first step toward improving the security of such systems. Starting from the original audios, we implement various attack methods, including adversarial, evasion, and pitching techniques, and evaluate how state-of-the-art disorder detection models respond to them. Our findings identify the most effective attack strategies, underscoring the need to address these vulnerabilities in machine-learning systems used in the healthcare domain.</description>

      <title>Domain-Adaptive Neural Posterior Estimation for Strong Gravitational Lens Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling strong gravitational lenses is prohibitively expensive for modern and next-generation cosmic survey data. Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a simulation-based inference (SBI) approach, has been studied as an avenue for efficient analysis of strong lensing data. However, NPE has not been demonstrated to perform well on out-of-domain target data -- e.g., when trained on simulated data and then applied to real, observational data. In this work, we perform the first study of the efficacy of NPE in combination with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). The source domain is noiseless, and the target domain has noise mimicking modern cosmology surveys. We find that combining UDA and NPE improves the accuracy of the inference by 1-2 orders of magnitude and significantly improves the posterior coverage over an NPE model without UDA. We anticipate that this combination of approaches will help enable future applications of NPE models to real observational data.</description>

      <title>A Simple Model of Inference Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural scaling laws have garnered significant interest due to their ability to predict model performance as a function of increasing parameters, data, and compute. In this work, we propose a simple statistical ansatz based on memorization to study scaling laws in the context of inference, specifically how performance improves with multiple inference attempts. We explore the coverage, or pass@k metric, which measures the chance of success over repeated attempts and provide a motivation for the observed functional form of the inference scaling behavior of the coverage in large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. We then define an "inference loss", which exhibits a power law decay as the number of trials increases, and connect this result with prompting costs. We further test our construction by conducting experiments on a simple generative model, and find that our predictions are in agreement with the empirical coverage curves in a controlled setting. Our simple framework sets the ground for incorporating inference scaling with other known scaling laws.</description>

      <title>LLM-based Optimization of Compound AI Systems: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a compound AI system, components such as an LLM call, a retriever, a code interpreter, or tools are interconnected. The system's behavior is primarily driven by parameters such as instructions or tool definitions. Recent advancements enable end-to-end optimization of these parameters using an LLM. Notably, leveraging an LLM as an optimizer is particularly efficient because it avoids gradient computation and can generate complex code and instructions. This paper presents a survey of the principles and emerging trends in LLM-based optimization of compound AI systems. It covers archetypes of compound AI systems, approaches to LLM-based end-to-end optimization, and insights into future directions and broader impacts. Importantly, this survey uses concepts from program analysis to provide a unified view of how an LLM optimizer is prompted to optimize a compound AI system. The exhaustive list of paper is provided at https://github.com/linyuhongg/LLM-based-Optimization-of-Compound-AI-Systems.</description>

      <title>Integrating Reinforcement Learning with Foundation Models for Autonomous Robotics: Methods and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), large deep learning models pre-trained on vast, unlabeled datasets, exhibit powerful capabilities in understanding complex patterns and generating sophisticated outputs. However, they often struggle to adapt to specific tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL), which allows agents to learn through interaction and feedback, offers a compelling solution. Integrating RL with FMs enables these models to achieve desired outcomes and excel at particular tasks. Additionally, RL can be enhanced by leveraging the reasoning and generalization capabilities of FMs. This synergy is revolutionizing various fields, including robotics. FMs, rich in knowledge and generalization, provide robots with valuable information, while RL facilitates learning and adaptation through real-world interactions.
  This survey paper comprehensively explores this exciting intersection, examining how these paradigms can be integrated to advance robotic intelligence. We analyze the use of foundation models as action planners, the development of robotics-specific foundation models, and the mutual benefits of combining FMs with RL. Furthermore, we present a taxonomy of integration approaches, including large language models, vision-language models, diffusion models, and transformer-based RL models. We also explore how RL can utilize world representations learned from FMs to enhance robotic task execution.
  Our survey aims to synthesize current research and highlight key challenges in robotic reasoning and control, particularly in the context of integrating FMs and RL--two rapidly evolving technologies. By doing so, we seek to spark future research and emphasize critical areas that require further investigation to enhance robotics. We provide an updated collection of papers based on our taxonomy, accessible on our open-source project website at: https://github.com/clmoro/Robotics-RL-FMs-Integration.</description>

      <title>Data Augmentation of Multivariate Sensor Time Series using Autoregressive Models and Application to Failure Prognostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel data augmentation solution for non-stationary multivariate time series and its application to failure prognostics. The method extends previous work from the authors which is based on time-varying autoregressive processes. It can be employed to extract key information from a limited number of samples and generate new synthetic samples in a way that potentially improves the performance of PHM solutions. This is especially valuable in situations of data scarcity which are very usual in PHM, especially for failure prognostics. The proposed approach is tested based on the CMAPSS dataset, commonly employed for prognostics experiments and benchmarks. An AutoML approach from PHM literature is employed for automating the design of the prognostics solution. The empirical evaluation provides evidence that the proposed method can substantially improve the performance of PHM solutions.</description>

      <title>BI-EqNO: Generalized Approximate Bayesian Inference with an Equivariant Neural Operator Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference offers a robust framework for updating prior beliefs based on new data using Bayes' theorem, but exact inference is often computationally infeasible, necessitating approximate methods. Though widely used, these methods struggle to estimate marginal likelihoods accurately, particularly due to the rigid functional structures of deterministic models like Gaussian processes and the limitations of small sample sizes in stochastic models like the ensemble Kalman method. In this work, we introduce BI-EqNO, an equivariant neural operator framework for generalized approximate Bayesian inference, designed to enhance both deterministic and stochastic approaches. BI-EqNO transforms priors into posteriors conditioned on observation data through data-driven training. The framework is flexible, supporting diverse prior and posterior representations with arbitrary discretizations and varying numbers of observations. Crucially, BI-EqNO's architecture ensures (1) permutation equivariance between prior and posterior representations, and (2) permutation invariance with respect to observational data. We demonstrate BI-EqNO's utility through two examples: (1) as a generalized Gaussian process (gGP) for regression, and (2) as an ensemble neural filter (EnNF) for sequential data assimilation. Results show that gGP outperforms traditional Gaussian processes by offering a more flexible representation of covariance functions. Additionally, EnNF not only outperforms the ensemble Kalman filter in small-ensemble settings but also has the potential to function as a "super" ensemble filter, capable of representing and integrating multiple ensemble filters for enhanced assimilation performance. This study highlights BI-EqNO's versatility and effectiveness, improving Bayesian inference through data-driven training while reducing computational costs across various applications.</description>

      <title>Position: Challenges and Opportunities for Differential Privacy in the U.S. Federal Government</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we seek to elucidate challenges and opportunities for differential privacy within the federal government setting, as seen by a team of differential privacy researchers, privacy lawyers, and data scientists working closely with the U.S. government. After introducing differential privacy, we highlight three significant challenges which currently restrict the use of differential privacy in the U.S. government. We then provide two examples where differential privacy can enhance the capabilities of government agencies. The first example highlights how the quantitative nature of differential privacy allows policy security officers to release multiple versions of analyses with different levels of privacy. The second example, which we believe is a novel realization, indicates that differential privacy can be used to improve staffing efficiency in classified applications. We hope that this article can serve as a nontechnical resource which can help frame future action from the differential privacy community, privacy regulators, security officers, and lawmakers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-assisted theorem proving refers to the process of conducting structured reasoning to automatically generate proofs for mathematical theorems. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in using machine learning models in conjunction with proof assistants to perform this task. In this paper, we introduce Pantograph, a tool that provides a versatile interface to the Lean 4 proof assistant and enables efficient proof search via powerful search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search. In addition, Pantograph enables high-level reasoning by enabling a more robust handling of Lean 4's inference steps. We provide an overview of Pantograph's architecture and features. We also report on an illustrative use case: using machine learning models and proof sketches to prove Lean 4 theorems. Pantograph's innovative features pave the way for more advanced machine learning models to perform complex proof searches and high-level reasoning, equipping future researchers to design more versatile and powerful theorem provers.</description>

      <title>Improving Neuron-level Interpretability with White-box Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurons in auto-regressive language models like GPT-2 can be interpreted by analyzing their activation patterns. Recent studies have shown that techniques such as dictionary learning, a form of post-hoc sparse coding, enhance this neuron-level interpretability. In our research, we are driven by the goal to fundamentally improve neural network interpretability by embedding sparse coding directly within the model architecture, rather than applying it as an afterthought. In our study, we introduce a white-box transformer-like architecture named Coding RAte TransformEr (CRATE), explicitly engineered to capture sparse, low-dimensional structures within data distributions. Our comprehensive experiments showcase significant improvements (up to 103% relative improvement) in neuron-level interpretability across a variety of evaluation metrics. Detailed investigations confirm that this enhanced interpretability is steady across different layers irrespective of the model size, underlining CRATE's robust performance in enhancing neural network interpretability. Further analysis shows that CRATE's increased interpretability comes from its enhanced ability to consistently and distinctively activate on relevant tokens. These findings point towards a promising direction for creating white-box foundation models that excel in neuron-level interpretation.</description>

      <title>Robust Feature Learning for Multi-Index Models in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there have been numerous studies on feature learning with neural networks, specifically on learning single- and multi-index models where the target is a function of a low-dimensional projection of the input. Prior works have shown that in high dimensions, the majority of the compute and data resources are spent on recovering the low-dimensional projection; once this subspace is recovered, the remainder of the target can be learned independently of the ambient dimension. However, implications of feature learning in adversarial settings remain unexplored. In this work, we take the first steps towards understanding adversarially robust feature learning with neural networks. Specifically, we prove that the hidden directions of a multi-index model offer a Bayes optimal low-dimensional projection for robustness against $\ell_2$-bounded adversarial perturbations under the squared loss, assuming that the multi-index coordinates are statistically independent from the rest of the coordinates. Therefore, robust learning can be achieved by first performing standard feature learning, then robustly tuning a linear readout layer on top of the standard representations. In particular, we show that adversarially robust learning is just as easy as standard learning, in the sense that the additional number of samples needed to robustly learn multi-index models when compared to standard learning, does not depend on dimensionality.</description>

      <title>STAR: A Simple Training-free Approach for Recommendations using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) offers promising new approaches for recommendation system (RecSys) tasks. While the current state-of-the-art methods rely on fine-tuning LLMs to achieve optimal results, this process is costly and introduces significant engineering complexities. Conversely, methods that bypass fine-tuning and use LLMs directly are less resource-intensive but often fail to fully capture both semantic and collaborative information, resulting in sub-optimal performance compared to their fine-tuned counterparts. In this paper, we propose a Simple Training-free Approach for Recommendation (STAR), a framework that utilizes LLMs and can be applied to various recommendation tasks without the need for fine-tuning. Our approach involves a retrieval stage that uses semantic embeddings from LLMs combined with collaborative user information to retrieve candidate items. We then apply an LLM for pairwise ranking to enhance next-item prediction. Experimental results on the Amazon Review dataset show competitive performance for next item prediction, even with our retrieval stage alone. Our full method achieves Hits@10 performance of +23.8% on Beauty, +37.5% on Toys and Games, and -1.8% on Sports and Outdoors relative to the best supervised models. This framework offers an effective alternative to traditional supervised models, highlighting the potential of LLMs in recommendation systems without extensive training or custom architectures.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Performance of a D-Wave Quantum Annealing System for Feature Subset Selection in Software Defect Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting software defects early in the development process not only enhances the quality and reliability of the software but also decreases the cost of development. A wide range of machine learning techniques can be employed to create software defect prediction models, but the effectiveness and accuracy of these models are often influenced by the choice of appropriate feature subset. Since finding the optimal feature subset is computationally intensive, heuristic and metaheuristic approaches are commonly employed to identify near-optimal solutions within a reasonable time frame. Recently, the quantum computing paradigm quantum annealing (QA) has been deployed to find solutions to complex optimization problems. This opens up the possibility of addressing the feature subset selection problem with a QA machine. Although several strategies have been proposed for feature subset selection using a QA machine, little exploration has been done regarding the viability of a QA machine for feature subset selection in software defect prediction. This study investigates the potential of D-Wave QA system for this task, where we formulate a mutual information (MI)-based filter approach as an optimization problem and utilize a D-Wave Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) solver as a QA solver for feature subset selection. We evaluate the performance of this approach using multiple software defect datasets from the AEEM, JIRA, and NASA projects. We also utilize a D-Wave classical solver for comparative analysis. Our experimental results demonstrate that QA-based feature subset selection can enhance software defect prediction. Although the D-Wave QPU solver exhibits competitive prediction performance with the classical solver in software defect prediction, it significantly reduces the time required to identify the best feature subset compared to its classical counterpart.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting a ligand's bound pose to a target protein is a key component of early-stage computational drug discovery. Recent developments in machine learning methods have focused on improving pose quality at the cost of model runtime. For high-throughput virtual screening applications, this exposes a capability gap that can be filled by moderately accurate but fast pose prediction. To this end, we developed QuickBind, a light-weight pose prediction algorithm. We assess QuickBind on widely used benchmarks and find that it provides an attractive trade-off between model accuracy and runtime. To facilitate virtual screening applications, we augment QuickBind with a binding affinity module and demonstrate its capabilities for multiple clinically-relevant drug targets. Finally, we investigate the mechanistic basis by which QuickBind makes predictions and find that it has learned key physicochemical properties of molecular docking, providing new insights into how machine learning models generate protein-ligand poses. By virtue of its simplicity, QuickBind can serve as both an effective virtual screening tool and a minimal test bed for exploring new model architectures and innovations.

      <title>Building Conformal Prediction Intervals with Approximate Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction has emerged as a powerful tool for building prediction intervals that are valid in a distribution-free way. However, its evaluation may be computationally costly, especially in the high-dimensional setting where the dimensionality and sample sizes are both large and of comparable magnitudes. To address this challenge in the context of generalized linear regression, we propose a novel algorithm based on Approximate Message Passing (AMP) to accelerate the computation of prediction intervals using full conformal prediction, by approximating the computation of conformity scores. Our work bridges a gap between modern uncertainty quantification techniques and tools for high-dimensional problems involving the AMP algorithm. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real data, and show that it produces prediction intervals that are close to the baseline methods, while being orders of magnitude faster. Additionally, in the high-dimensional limit and under assumptions on the data distribution, the conformity scores computed by AMP converge to the one computed exactly, which allows theoretical study and benchmarking of conformal methods in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Do Audio-Language Models Understand Linguistic Variations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary audio language models (ALMs), like Contrastive Language Audio Pretraining (CLAP), represent a promising new paradigm for audio-text retrieval using natural language queries. In this paper, for the first time, we perform controlled experiments on various benchmarks to show that existing ALMs struggle to generalize to linguistic variations in textual queries. To address this issue, we propose RobustCLAP, a novel and compute-efficient technique to learn audio-language representations agnostic to linguistic variations. Specifically, we reformulate the contrastive loss used in CLAP architectures by introducing a multi-view contrastive learning objective, where paraphrases are treated as different views of the same audio scene and use this for training. Our proposed approach improves the text-to-audio retrieval performance of CLAP by 0.8%-13% across benchmarks and enhances robustness to linguistic variation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the approximation property of ReLU neural networks (NNs) to piecewise constant functions with unknown interfaces in bounded regions in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Under the assumption that the discontinuity interface $\Gamma$ may be approximated by a connected series of hyperplanes with a prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon &gt;0$, we show that a three-layer ReLU NN is sufficient to accurately approximate any piecewise constant function and establish its error bound. Moreover, if the discontinuity interface is convex, an analytical formula of the ReLU NN approximation with exact weights and biases is provided.</description>

      <title>Learning from others' mistakes: Finetuning machine translation models with span-level error annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in incorporating feedback to improve language models, most efforts focus only on sequence-level annotations. In this work, we explore the potential of utilizing fine-grained span-level annotations from offline datasets to improve model quality. We develop a simple finetuning algorithm, called Training with Annotations (TWA), to directly train machine translation models on such annotated data. TWA utilizes targeted span-level error information while also flexibly learning what to penalize within a span. Moreover, TWA considers the overall trajectory of a sequence when deciding which non-error spans to utilize as positive signals. Experiments on English-German and Chinese-English machine translation show that TWA outperforms baselines such as Supervised FineTuning on sequences filtered for quality and Direct Preference Optimization on pairs constructed from the same data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report presents a comparative analysis of open-source vulnerability scanners for conversational large language models (LLMs). As LLMs become integral to various applications, they also present potential attack surfaces, exposed to security risks such as information leakage and jailbreak attacks. Our study evaluates prominent scanners - Garak, Giskard, PyRIT, and CyberSecEval - that adapt red-teaming practices to expose these vulnerabilities. We detail the distinctive features and practical use of these scanners, outline unifying principles of their design and perform quantitative evaluations to compare them. These evaluations uncover significant reliability issues in detecting successful attacks, highlighting a fundamental gap for future development. Additionally, we contribute a preliminary labelled dataset, which serves as an initial step to bridge this gap. Based on the above, we provide strategic recommendations to assist organizations choose the most suitable scanner for their red-teaming needs, accounting for customizability, test suite comprehensiveness, and industry-specific use cases.</description>

      <title>Bayesian scaling laws for in-context learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a powerful technique for getting language models to perform complex tasks with no training updates. Prior work has established strong correlations between the number of in-context examples provided and the accuracy of the model's predictions. In this paper, we seek to explain this correlation by showing that ICL approximates a Bayesian learner. This perspective gives rise to a family of novel Bayesian scaling laws for ICL. In experiments with \mbox{GPT-2} models of different sizes, our scaling laws exceed or match existing scaling laws in accuracy while also offering interpretable terms for task priors, learning efficiency, and per-example probabilities. To illustrate the analytic power that such interpretable scaling laws provide, we report on controlled synthetic dataset experiments designed to inform real-world studies of safety alignment. In our experimental protocol, we use SFT to suppress an unwanted existing model capability and then use ICL to try to bring that capability back (many-shot jailbreaking). We then experiment on real-world instruction-tuned LLMs using capabilities benchmarks as well as a new many-shot jailbreaking dataset. In all cases, Bayesian scaling laws accurately predict the conditions under which ICL will cause the suppressed behavior to reemerge, which sheds light on the ineffectiveness of post-training at increasing LLM safety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As virtual agents become increasingly prevalent in human-computer interaction, generating realistic and contextually appropriate gestures in real-time remains a significant challenge. While neural rendering techniques have made substantial progress with static scripts, their applicability to human-computer interactions remains limited. To address this, we introduce Large Body Language Models (LBLMs) and present LBLM-AVA, a novel LBLM architecture that combines a Transformer-XL large language model with a parallelized diffusion model to generate human-like gestures from multimodal inputs (text, audio, and video). LBLM-AVA incorporates several key components enhancing its gesture generation capabilities, such as multimodal-to-pose embeddings, enhanced sequence-to-sequence mapping with redefined attention mechanisms, a temporal smoothing module for gesture sequence coherence, and an attention-based refinement module for enhanced realism. The model is trained on our large-scale proprietary open-source dataset Allo-AVA. LBLM-AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating lifelike and contextually appropriate gestures with a 30% reduction in Fr\'echet Gesture Distance (FGD), and a 25% improvement in Fr\'echet Inception Distance compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>QIXAI: A Quantum-Inspired Framework for Enhancing Classical and Quantum Model Transparency and Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impressive performance of deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), is often hindered by their lack of interpretability, rendering them "black boxes." This opacity raises concerns in critical areas like healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, where trust and accountability are crucial. This paper introduces the QIXAI Framework (Quantum-Inspired Explainable AI), a novel approach for enhancing neural network interpretability through quantum-inspired techniques. By utilizing principles from quantum mechanics, such as Hilbert spaces, superposition, entanglement, and eigenvalue decomposition, the QIXAI framework reveals how different layers of neural networks process and combine features to make decisions.
  We critically assess model-agnostic methods like SHAP and LIME, as well as techniques like Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), highlighting their limitations in providing a comprehensive view of neural network operations. The QIXAI framework overcomes these limitations by offering deeper insights into feature importance, inter-layer dependencies, and information propagation. A CNN for malaria parasite detection is used as a case study to demonstrate how quantum-inspired methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Mutual Information (MI) provide interpretable explanations of model behavior. Additionally, we explore the extension of QIXAI to other architectures, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformers, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, and its application to generative models and time-series analysis. The framework applies to both quantum and classical systems, demonstrating its potential to improve interpretability and transparency across a range of models, advancing the broader goal of developing trustworthy AI systems.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Understanding of Chain-of-Thought: Coherent Reasoning and Error-Aware Demonstration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has demonstrated strong performance in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While theoretical investigations have been conducted to understand CoT, the underlying transformer used in these studies isolates the CoT reasoning process into separated in-context learning steps (Stepwise ICL). In this work, we theoretically show that, compared to Stepwise ICL, the transformer gains better error correction ability and more accurate predictions if the reasoning from earlier steps (Coherent CoT) is integrated. Given that this coherent reasoning changes the behavior of the transformer, we further investigate the sensitivity of the transformer with Coherent CoT when the demonstration examples are corrupted at the inference stage. Our theoretical results indicate that the transformer is more sensitive to errors in intermediate reasoning steps than the final outcome. Building upon this observation, we propose an improvement on CoT by incorporating both correct and incorrect reasoning paths in the demonstration. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Implicit Contact Diffuser: Sequential Contact Reasoning with Latent Point Cloud Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-horizon contact-rich manipulation has long been a challenging problem, as it requires reasoning over both discrete contact modes and continuous object motion. We introduce Implicit Contact Diffuser (ICD), a diffusion-based model that generates a sequence of neural descriptors that specify a series of contact relationships between the object and the environment. This sequence is then used as guidance for an MPC method to accomplish a given task. The key advantage of this approach is that the latent descriptors provide more task-relevant guidance to MPC, helping to avoid local minima for contact-rich manipulation tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that ICD outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation tasks, such as cable routing and notebook folding. Additionally, our experiments also indicate that \methodshort can generalize a target contact relationship to a different environment. More visualizations can be found on our website $\href{https://implicit-contact-diffuser.github.io/}{https://implicit-contact-diffuser.github.io}$</description>

      <title>How Can We Diagnose and Treat Bias in Large Language Models for Clinical Decision-Making?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as powerful tools for clinical decision-making, with rapidly expanding applications in healthcare. However, concerns about bias remain a significant challenge in the clinical implementation of LLMs, particularly regarding gender and ethnicity. This research investigates the evaluation and mitigation of bias in LLMs applied to complex clinical cases, focusing on gender and ethnicity biases. We introduce a novel Counterfactual Patient Variations (CPV) dataset derived from the JAMA Clinical Challenge. Using this dataset, we built a framework for bias evaluation, employing both Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and corresponding explanations. We explore prompting with eight LLMs and fine-tuning as debiasing methods. Our findings reveal that addressing social biases in LLMs requires a multidimensional approach as mitigating gender bias can occur while introducing ethnicity biases, and that gender bias in LLM embeddings varies significantly across medical specialities. We demonstrate that evaluating both MCQ response and explanation processes is crucial, as correct responses can be based on biased \textit{reasoning}. We provide a framework for evaluating LLM bias in real-world clinical cases, offer insights into the complex nature of bias in these models, and present strategies for bias mitigation.</description>

      <title>Graph Sampling for Scalable and Expressive Graph Neural Networks on Homophilic Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in many graph machine learning tasks but face challenges when scaling to large networks. GNN transferability allows training on smaller graphs and applying the model to larger ones, but existing methods often rely on random subsampling, leading to disconnected subgraphs and reduced model expressivity. We propose a novel graph sampling algorithm that leverages feature homophily to preserve graph structure. By minimizing the trace of the data correlation matrix, our method better preserves the graph Laplacian's rank than random sampling while achieving lower complexity than spectral methods. Experiments on citation networks show improved performance in preserving graph rank and GNN transferability compared to random sampling.</description>

      <title>Assessing and improving reliability of neighbor embedding methods: a map-continuity perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visualizing high-dimensional data is an important routine for understanding biomedical data and interpreting deep learning models. Neighbor embedding methods, such as t-SNE, UMAP, and LargeVis, among others, are a family of popular visualization methods which reduce high-dimensional data to two dimensions. However, recent studies suggest that these methods often produce visual artifacts, potentially leading to incorrect scientific conclusions. Recognizing that the current limitation stems from a lack of data-independent notions of embedding maps, we introduce a novel conceptual and computational framework, LOO-map, that learns the embedding maps based on a classical statistical idea known as the leave-one-out. LOO-map extends the embedding over a discrete set of input points to the entire input space, enabling a systematic assessment of map continuity, and thus the reliability of the visualizations. We find for many neighbor embedding methods, their embedding maps can be intrinsically discontinuous. The discontinuity induces two types of observed map distortion: ``overconfidence-inducing discontinuity," which exaggerates cluster separation, and ``fracture-inducing discontinuity," which creates spurious local structures. Building upon LOO-map, we propose two diagnostic point-wise scores -- perturbation score and singularity score -- to address these limitations. These scores can help identify unreliable embedding points, detect out-of-distribution data, and guide hyperparameter selection. Our approach is flexible and works as a wrapper around many neighbor embedding algorithms. We test our methods across multiple real-world datasets from computer vision and single-cell omics to demonstrate their effectiveness in enhancing the interpretability and accuracy of visualizations.</description>

Abstract: Analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to detect the epileptic seizure status of a subject presents a challenge to existing technologies aimed at providing timely and efficient diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to detect interictal and ictal periods of epileptic seizures using a spiking neural network (SNN). Our proposed approach provides an online and real-time preliminary diagnosis of epileptic seizures and helps to detect possible pathological conditions.To validate our approach, we conducted experiments using multiple datasets. We utilized a trained SNN to identify the presence of epileptic seizures and compared our results with those of related studies. The SNN model was deployed on Xylo, a digital SNN neuromorphic processor designed to process temporal signals. Xylo efficiently simulates spiking leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with exponential input synapses. Xylo has much lower energy requirments than traditional approaches to signal processing, making it an ideal platform for developing low-power seizure detection systems.Our proposed method has a high test accuracy of 93.3% and 92.9% when classifying ictal and interictal periods. At the same time, the application has an average power consumption of 87.4 uW(IO power) + 287.9 uW(computational power) when deployed to Xylo. Our method demonstrates excellent low-latency performance when tested on multiple datasets. Our work provides a new solution for seizure detection, and it is expected to be widely used in portable and wearable devices in the future.</description>

      <title>SoK: Dataset Copyright Auditing in Machine Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the implementation of machine learning (ML) systems becomes more widespread, especially with the introduction of larger ML models, we perceive a spring demand for massive data. However, it inevitably causes infringement and misuse problems with the data, such as using unauthorized online artworks or face images to train ML models. To address this problem, many efforts have been made to audit the copyright of the model training dataset. However, existing solutions vary in auditing assumptions and capabilities, making it difficult to compare their strengths and weaknesses. In addition, robustness evaluations usually consider only part of the ML pipeline and hardly reflect the performance of algorithms in real-world ML applications. Thus, it is essential to take a practical deployment perspective on the current dataset copyright auditing tools, examining their effectiveness and limitations. Concretely, we categorize dataset copyright auditing research into two prominent strands: intrusive methods and non-intrusive methods, depending on whether they require modifications to the original dataset. Then, we break down the intrusive methods into different watermark injection options and examine the non-intrusive methods using various fingerprints. To summarize our results, we offer detailed reference tables, highlight key points, and pinpoint unresolved issues in the current literature. By combining the pipeline in ML systems and analyzing previous studies, we highlight several future directions to make auditing tools more suitable for real-world copyright protection requirements.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Smoothness and Reducing High-Frequency Oscillations in Continuous Control Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies are prone to high-frequency oscillations, especially undesirable when deploying to hardware in the real-world. In this paper, we identify, categorize, and compare methods from the literature that aim to mitigate high-frequency oscillations in deep RL. We define two broad classes: loss regularization and architectural methods. At their core, these methods incentivize learning a smooth mapping, such that nearby states in the input space produce nearby actions in the output space. We present benchmarks in terms of policy performance and control smoothness on traditional RL environments from the Gymnasium and a complex manipulation task, as well as three robotics locomotion tasks that include deployment and evaluation with real-world hardware. Finally, we also propose hybrid methods that combine elements from both loss regularization and architectural methods. We find that the best-performing hybrid outperforms other methods, and improves control smoothness by 26.8% over the baseline, with a worst-case performance degradation of just 2.8%.</description>

      <title>General Frameworks for Conditional Two-Sample Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of conditional two-sample testing, which aims to determine whether two populations have the same distribution after accounting for confounding factors. This problem commonly arises in various applications, such as domain adaptation and algorithmic fairness, where comparing two groups is essential while controlling for confounding variables. We begin by establishing a hardness result for conditional two-sample testing, demonstrating that no valid test can have significant power against any single alternative without proper assumptions. We then introduce two general frameworks that implicitly or explicitly target specific classes of distributions for their validity and power. Our first framework allows us to convert any conditional independence test into a conditional two-sample test in a black-box manner, while preserving the asymptotic properties of the original conditional independence test. The second framework transforms the problem into comparing marginal distributions with estimated density ratios, which allows us to leverage existing methods for marginal two-sample testing. We demonstrate this idea in a concrete manner with classification and kernel-based methods. Finally, simulation studies are conducted to illustrate the proposed frameworks in finite-sample scenarios.</description>

      <title>LLMScan: Causal Scan for LLM Misbehavior Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various fields, their potential to generate untruthful, biased and harmful responses poses significant risks, particularly in critical applications. This highlights the urgent need for systematic methods to detect and prevent such misbehavior. While existing approaches target specific issues such as harmful responses, this work introduces LLMScan, an innovative LLM monitoring technique based on causality analysis, offering a comprehensive solution. LLMScan systematically monitors the inner workings of an LLM through the lens of causal inference, operating on the premise that the LLM's `brain' behaves differently when misbehaving. By analyzing the causal contributions of the LLM's input tokens and transformer layers, LLMScan effectively detects misbehavior. Extensive experiments across various tasks and models reveal clear distinctions in the causal distributions between normal behavior and misbehavior, enabling the development of accurate, lightweight detectors for a variety of misbehavior detection tasks.</description>

      <title>GE2E-KWS: Generalized End-to-End Training and Evaluation for Zero-shot Keyword Spotting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose GE2E-KWS -- a generalized end-to-end training and evaluation framework for customized keyword spotting. Specifically, enrollment utterances are separated and grouped by keywords from the training batch and their embedding centroids are compared to all other test utterance embeddings to compute the loss. This simulates runtime enrollment and verification stages, and improves convergence stability and training speed by optimizing matrix operations compared to SOTA triplet loss approaches. To benchmark different models reliably, we propose an evaluation process that mimics the production environment and compute metrics that directly measure keyword matching accuracy. Trained with GE2E loss, our 419KB quantized conformer model beats a 7.5GB ASR encoder by 23.6% relative AUC, and beats a same size triplet loss model by 60.7% AUC. Our KWS models are natively streamable with low memory footprints, and designed to continuously run on-device with no retraining needed for new keywords (zero-shot).</description>

      <title>Parsimonious Dynamic Mode Decomposition: A Robust and Automated Approach for Optimally Sparse Mode Selection in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Parsimonious Dynamic Mode Decomposition (parsDMD), a novel algorithm designed to automatically select an optimally sparse subset of dynamic modes for both spatiotemporal and purely temporal data. By incorporating time-delay embedding and leveraging Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), parsDMD ensures robustness against noise and effectively handles complex, nonlinear dynamics. The algorithm is validated on a diverse range of datasets, including standing wave signals, identifying hidden dynamics, fluid dynamics simulations (flow past a cylinder and transonic buffet), and atmospheric sea-surface temperature (SST) data. ParsDMD addresses a significant limitation of the traditional sparsity-promoting DMD (spDMD), which requires manual tuning of sparsity parameters through a rigorous trial-and-error process to balance between single-mode and all-mode solutions. In contrast, parsDMD autonomously determines the optimally sparse subset of modes without user intervention, while maintaining minimal computational complexity. Comparative analyses demonstrate that parsDMD consistently outperforms spDMD by providing more accurate mode identification and effective reconstruction in noisy environments. These advantages render parsDMD an effective tool for real-time diagnostics, forecasting, and reduced-order model construction across various disciplines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With increasing usage of generative models for text generation and widespread use of machine generated texts in various domains, being able to distinguish between human written and machine generated texts is a significant challenge. While existing models and proprietary systems focus on identifying whether given text is entirely human written or entirely machine generated, only a few systems provide insights at sentence or paragraph level at likelihood of being machine generated at a non reliable accuracy level, working well only for a set of domains and generators. This paper introduces few reliable approaches for the novel task of identifying which part of a given text is machine generated at a word level while comparing results from different approaches and methods. We present a comparison with proprietary systems , performance of our model on unseen domains' and generators' texts. The findings reveal significant improvements in detection accuracy along with comparison on other aspects of detection capabilities. Finally we discuss potential avenues for improvement and implications of our work. The proposed model is also well suited for detecting which parts of a text are machine generated in outputs of Instruct variants of many LLMs.</description>

      <title>QuasiNav: Asymmetric Cost-Aware Navigation Planning with Constrained Quasimetric Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unstructured outdoor environments is inherently challenging due to the presence of asymmetric traversal costs, such as varying energy expenditures for uphill versus downhill movement. Traditional reinforcement learning methods often assume symmetric costs, which can lead to suboptimal navigation paths and increased safety risks in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce QuasiNav, a novel reinforcement learning framework that integrates quasimetric embeddings to explicitly model asymmetric costs and guide efficient, safe navigation. QuasiNav formulates the navigation problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) and employs quasimetric embeddings to capture directionally dependent costs, allowing for a more accurate representation of the terrain. This approach is combined with adaptive constraint tightening within a constrained policy optimization framework to dynamically enforce safety constraints during learning. We validate QuasiNav across three challenging navigation scenarios-undulating terrains, asymmetric hill traversal, and directionally dependent terrain traversal-demonstrating its effectiveness in both simulated and real-world environments. Experimental results show that QuasiNav significantly outperforms conventional methods, achieving higher success rates, improved energy efficiency, and better adherence to safety constraints.</description>

      <title>Methods of improving LLM training stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training stability of large language models(LLMs) is an important research topic. Reproducing training instabilities can be costly, so we use a small language model with 830M parameters and experiment with higher learning rates to force models to diverge. One of the sources of training instability is the growth of logits in attention layers. We extend the focus of the previous work and look not only at the magnitude of the logits but at all outputs of linear layers in the Transformer block. We observe that with a high learning rate the L2 norm of all linear layer outputs can grow with each training step and the model diverges. Specifically we observe that QKV, Proj and FC2 layers have the largest growth of the output magnitude. This prompts us to explore several options: 1) apply layer normalization not only after QK layers but also after Proj and FC2 layers too; 2) apply layer normalization after the QKV layer (and remove pre normalization). 3) apply QK layer normalization together with softmax capping. We show that with the last two methods we can increase learning rate by 1.5x (without model divergence) in comparison to an approach based on QK layer normalization only. Also we observe significant perplexity improvements for all three methods in comparison to the baseline model.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Time-Varying Kernelized Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimization of black-box functions with noisy observations is a fundamental problem with widespread applications, and has been widely studied under the assumption that the function lies in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). This problem has been studied extensively in the stationary setting, and near-optimal regret bounds are known via developments in both upper and lower bounds. In this paper, we consider non-stationary scenarios, which are crucial for certain applications but are currently less well-understood. Specifically, we provide the first algorithm-independent lower bounds, where the time variations are subject satisfying a total variation budget according to some function norm. Under $\ell_{\infty}$-norm variations, our bounds are found to be close to the state-of-the-art upper bound (Hong \emph{et al.}, 2023). Under RKHS norm variations, the upper and lower bounds are still reasonably close but with more of a gap, raising the interesting open question of whether non-minor improvements in the upper bound are possible.</description>

      <title>Privacy-hardened and hallucination-resistant synthetic data generation with logic-solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-generated data is a valuable resource for training Artificial Intelligence algorithms, evaluating rare workflows, and sharing data under stricter data legislations. The challenge is to generate data that is accurate and private. Current statistical and deep learning methods struggle with large data volumes, are prone to hallucinating scenarios incompatible with reality, and seldom quantify privacy meaningfully. Here we introduce Genomator, a logic solving approach (SAT solving), which efficiently produces private and realistic representations of the original data. We demonstrate the method on genomic data, which arguably is the most complex and private information. Synthetic genomes hold great potential for balancing underrepresented populations in medical research and advancing global data exchange. We benchmark Genomator against state-of-the-art methodologies (Markov generation, Restricted Boltzmann Machine, Generative Adversarial Network and Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines), demonstrating an 84-93% accuracy improvement and 95-98% higher privacy. Genomator is also 1000-1600 times more efficient, making it the only tested method that scales to whole genomes. We show the universal trade-off between privacy and accuracy, and use Genomator's tuning capability to cater to all applications along the spectrum, from provable private representations of sensitive cohorts, to datasets with indistinguishable pharmacogenomic profiles. Demonstrating the production-scale generation of tuneable synthetic data can increase trust and pave the way into the clinic.</description>

      <title>Influential Language Data Selection via Gradient Trajectory Pursuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Curating a desirable dataset for training has been the core of building highly capable large language models (Touvron et al., 2023; Achiam et al., 2023; Team et al.,2024). Gradient influence scores (Pruthi et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2024) are shown to be correlated with model performance and are commonly used as the criterion for data selection. However, existing methods are built upon either individual sample rankings or inefficient matching process, leading to suboptimal performance or scaling up issues.In this paper, we propose Gradient Trajectory Pursuit (GTP), an algorithm that performs pursuit of gradient trajectories via jointly selecting data points under an L0-norm regularized objective. The proposed algorithm highlights: (1) joint selection instead of independent top-k selection, which automatically de-duplicates samples; (2) higher efficiency with compressive sampling processes, which can be further sped up using a distributed framework. In the experiments, we demonstrate the algorithm in both in-domain and target-domain selection benchmarks and show that it outperforms top-k selection and competitive algorithms consistently, for example, our algorithm chooses as low as 0.5% data to achieve full performance on the targeted instruction tuning tasks</description>

      <title>Progressive Compositionality In Text-to-Image Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the impressive text-to-image (T2I) synthesis capabilities of diffusion models, they often struggle to understand compositional relationships between objects and attributes, especially in complex settings. Existing solutions have tackled these challenges by optimizing the cross-attention mechanism or learning from the caption pairs with minimal semantic changes. However, can we generate high-quality complex contrastive images that diffusion models can directly discriminate based on visual representations? In this work, we leverage large-language models (LLMs) to compose realistic, complex scenarios and harness Visual-Question Answering (VQA) systems alongside diffusion models to automatically curate a contrastive dataset, ConPair, consisting of 15k pairs of high-quality contrastive images. These pairs feature minimal visual discrepancies and cover a wide range of attribute categories, especially complex and natural scenarios. To learn effectively from these error cases, i.e., hard negative images, we propose EvoGen, a new multi-stage curriculum for contrastive learning of diffusion models. Through extensive experiments across a wide range of compositional scenarios, we showcase the effectiveness of our proposed framework on compositional T2I benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Convergence Guarantees for Variational Autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAE) are popular generative models used to sample from complex data distributions. Despite their empirical success in various machine learning tasks, significant gaps remain in understanding their theoretical properties, particularly regarding convergence guarantees. This paper aims to bridge that gap by providing non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for VAE trained using both Stochastic Gradient Descent and Adam algorithms.We derive a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log n / \sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the number of iterations of the optimization algorithm, with explicit dependencies on the batch size, the number of variational samples, and other key hyperparameters. Our theoretical analysis applies to both Linear VAE and Deep Gaussian VAE, as well as several VAE variants, including $\beta$-VAE and IWAE. Additionally, we empirically illustrate the impact of hyperparameters on convergence, offering new insights into the theoretical understanding of VAE training.</description>

      <title>Survival Models: Proper Scoring Rule and Stochastic Optimization with Competing Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When dealing with right-censored data, where some outcomes are missing due to a limited observation period, survival analysis -- known as time-to-event analysis -- focuses on predicting the time until an event of interest occurs. Multiple classes of outcomes lead to a classification variant: predicting the most likely event, a less explored area known as competing risks. Classic competing risks models couple architecture and loss, limiting scalability.To address these issues, we design a strictly proper censoring-adjusted separable scoring rule, allowing optimization on a subset of the data as each observation is evaluated independently. The loss estimates outcome probabilities and enables stochastic optimization for competing risks, which we use for efficient gradient boosting trees. SurvivalBoost not only outperforms 12 state-of-the-art models across several metrics on 4 real-life datasets, both in competing risks and survival settings, but also provides great calibration, the ability to predict across any time horizon, and computation times faster than existing methods.</description>

      <title>Beyond Retrieval: Generating Narratives in Conversational Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent advances in Large Language Model's generation and reasoning capabilities present an opportunity to develop truly conversational recommendation systems. However, effectively integrating recommender system knowledge into LLMs for natural language generation which is tailored towards recommendation tasks remains a challenge. This paper addresses this challenge by making two key contributions.
  First, we introduce a new dataset (REGEN) for natural language generation tasks in conversational recommendations. REGEN (Reviews Enhanced with GEnerative Narratives) extends the Amazon Product Reviews dataset with rich user narratives, including personalized explanations of product preferences, product endorsements for recommended items, and summaries of user purchase history. REGEN is made publicly available to facilitate further research. Furthermore, we establish benchmarks using well-known generative metrics, and perform an automated evaluation of the new dataset using a rater LLM. Second, the paper introduces a fusion architecture (CF model with an LLM) which serves as a baseline for REGEN. And to the best of our knowledge, represents the first attempt to analyze the capabilities of LLMs in understanding recommender signals and generating rich narratives. We demonstrate that LLMs can effectively learn from simple fusion architectures utilizing interaction-based CF embeddings, and this can be further enhanced using the metadata and personalization data associated with items. Our experiments show that combining CF and content embeddings leads to improvements of 4-12% in key language metrics compared to using either type of embedding individually. We also provide an analysis to interpret how CF and content embeddings contribute to this new generative task.</description>

      <title>One-Step Diffusion Distillation through Score Implicit Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their strong performances on many generative tasks, diffusion models require a large number of sampling steps in order to generate realistic samples. This has motivated the community to develop effective methods to distill pre-trained diffusion models into more efficient models, but these methods still typically require few-step inference or perform substantially worse than the underlying model. In this paper, we present Score Implicit Matching (SIM) a new approach to distilling pre-trained diffusion models into single-step generator models, while maintaining almost the same sample generation ability as the original model as well as being data-free with no need of training samples for distillation. The method rests upon the fact that, although the traditional score-based loss is intractable to minimize for generator models, under certain conditions we can efficiently compute the gradients for a wide class of score-based divergences between a diffusion model and a generator. SIM shows strong empirical performances for one-step generators: on the CIFAR10 dataset, it achieves an FID of 2.06 for unconditional generation and 1.96 for class-conditional generation. Moreover, by applying SIM to a leading transformer-based diffusion model, we distill a single-step generator for text-to-image (T2I) generation that attains an aesthetic score of 6.42 with no performance decline over the original multi-step counterpart, clearly outperforming the other one-step generators including SDXL-TURBO of 5.33, SDXL-LIGHTNING of 5.34 and HYPER-SDXL of 5.85. We will release this industry-ready one-step transformer-based T2I generator along with this paper.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Effectiveness of Attack-Agnostic Features for Morphing Attack Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Morphing attacks have diversified significantly over the past years, with new methods based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models posing substantial threats to face recognition systems. Recent research has demonstrated the effectiveness of features extracted from large vision models pretrained on bonafide data only (attack-agnostic features) for detecting deep generative images. Building on this, we investigate the potential of these image representations for morphing attack detection (MAD). We develop supervised detectors by training a simple binary linear SVM on the extracted features and one-class detectors by modeling the distribution of bonafide features with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Our method is evaluated across a comprehensive set of attacks and various scenarios, including generalization to unseen attacks, different source datasets, and print-scan data. Our results indicate that attack-agnostic features can effectively detect morphing attacks, outperforming traditional supervised and one-class detectors from the literature in most scenarios. Additionally, we provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each considered representation and discuss potential future research directions to further enhance the robustness and generalizability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Guarantees of a Preconditioned Subgradient Algorithm for Overparameterized Asymmetric Low-rank Matrix Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on a matrix factorization-based approach for robust low-rank and asymmetric matrix recovery from corrupted measurements. We address the challenging scenario where the rank of the sought matrix is unknown and employ an overparameterized approach using the variational form of the nuclear norm as a regularizer. We propose a subgradient algorithm that inherits the merits of preconditioned algorithms, whose rate of convergence does not depend on the condition number of the sought matrix, and addresses their current limitation, i.e., the lack of convergence guarantees in the case of asymmetric matrices with unknown rank. In this setting, we provide, for the first time in the literature, linear convergence guarantees for the derived overparameterized preconditioned subgradient algorithm in the presence of gross corruptions. Additionally, by applying our approach to matrix sensing, we highlight its merits when the measurement operator satisfies the mixed-norm restricted isometry properties. Lastly, we present numerical experiments that validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Safe Load Balancing in Software-Defined-Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High performance, reliability and safety are crucial properties of any Software-Defined-Networking (SDN) system. Although the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms has been widely studied to improve performance, their practical applications are still limited as they fail to ensure safe operations in exploration and decision-making. To fill this gap, we explore the design of a Control Barrier Function (CBF) on top of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms for load-balancing. We show that our DRL-CBF approach is capable of meeting safety requirements during training and testing while achieving near-optimal performance in testing. We provide results using two simulators: a flow-based simulator, which is used for proof-of-concept and benchmarking, and a packet-based simulator that implements real protocols and scheduling. Thanks to the flow-based simulator, we compared the performance against the optimal policy, solving a Non Linear Programming (NLP) problem with the SCIP solver. Furthermore, we showed that pre-trained models in the flow-based simulator, which is faster, can be transferred to the packet simulator, which is slower but more accurate, with some fine-tuning. Overall, the results suggest that near-optimal Quality-of-Service (QoS) performance in terms of end-to-end delay can be achieved while safety requirements related to link capacity constraints are guaranteed. In the packet-based simulator, we also show that our DRL-CBF algorithms outperform non-RL baseline algorithms. When the models are fine-tuned over a few episodes, we achieved smoother QoS and safety in training, and similar performance in testing compared to the case where models have been trained from scratch.</description>

      <title>Polyak's Heavy Ball Method Achieves Accelerated Local Rate of Convergence under Polyak-Lojasiewicz Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the convergence of Polyak's heavy ball method, both in continuous and discrete time, on a non-convex objective function. We recover the convergence rates derived in [Polyak, U.S.S.R. Comput. Math. and Math. Phys., 1964] for strongly convex objective functions, assuming only validity of the Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality. In continuous time our result holds for all initializations, whereas in the discrete time setting we conduct a local analysis around the global minima. Our results demonstrate that the heavy ball method does, in fact, accelerate on the class of objective functions satisfying the Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality. This holds even in the discrete time setting, provided the method reaches a neighborhood of the global minima. Instead of the usually employed Lyapunov-type arguments, our approach leverages a new differential geometric perspective of the Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality proposed in [Rebjock and Boumal, Math. Program., 2024].</description>

      <title>Dynamic graph neural networks for enhanced volatility prediction in financial markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Volatility forecasting is essential for risk management and decision-making in financial markets. Traditional models like Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) effectively capture volatility clustering but often fail to model complex, non-linear interdependencies between multiple indices. This paper proposes a novel approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent global financial markets as dynamic graphs. The Temporal Graph Attention Network (Temporal GAT) combines Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to capture the temporal and structural dynamics of volatility spillovers. By utilizing correlation-based and volatility spillover indices, the Temporal GAT constructs directed graphs that enhance the accuracy of volatility predictions. Empirical results from a 15-year study of eight major global indices show that the Temporal GAT outperforms traditional GARCH models and other machine learning methods, particularly in short- to mid-term forecasts. The sensitivity and scenario-based analysis over a range of parameters and hyperparameters further demonstrate the significance of the proposed technique. Hence, this work highlights the potential of GNNs in modeling complex market behaviors, providing valuable insights for financial analysts and investors.</description>

      <title>Federated Causal Inference: Multi-Centric ATE Estimation beyond Meta-Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Federated Causal Inference, an approach to estimate treatment effects from decentralized data across centers. We compare three classes of Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimators derived from the Plug-in G-Formula, ranging from simple meta-analysis to one-shot and multi-shot federated learning, the latter leveraging the full data to learn the outcome model (albeit requiring more communication). Focusing on Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), we derive the asymptotic variance of these estimators for linear models. Our results provide practical guidance on selecting the appropriate estimator for various scenarios, including heterogeneity in sample sizes, covariate distributions, treatment assignment schemes, and center effects. We validate these findings with a simulation study.</description>

      <title>Contrasting Attitudes Towards Current and Future AI Applications for Computerised Interpretation of ECG: A Clinical Stakeholder Interview Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objectives: To investigate clinicians' attitudes towards current automated interpretation of ECG and novel AI technologies and their perception of computer-assisted interpretation. Materials and Methods: We conducted a series of interviews with clinicians in the UK. Our study: (i) explores the potential for AI, specifically future 'human-like' computing approaches, to facilitate ECG interpretation and support clinical decision making, and (ii) elicits their opinions about the importance of explainability and trustworthiness of AI algorithms. Results: We performed inductive thematic analysis on interview transcriptions from 23 clinicians and identified the following themes: (i) a lack of trust in current systems, (ii) positive attitudes towards future AI applications and requirements for these, (iii) the relationship between the accuracy and explainability of algorithms, and (iv) opinions on education, possible deskilling, and the impact of AI on clinical competencies. Discussion: Clinicians do not trust current computerised methods, but welcome future 'AI' technologies. Where clinicians trust future AI interpretation to be accurate, they are less concerned that it is explainable. They also preferred ECG interpretation that demonstrated the results of the algorithm visually. Whilst clinicians do not fear job losses, they are concerned about deskilling and the need to educate the workforce to use AI responsibly. Conclusion: Clinicians are positive about the future application of AI in clinical decision-making. Accuracy is a key factor of uptake and visualisations are preferred over current computerised methods. This is viewed as a potential means of training and upskilling, in contrast to the deskilling that automation might be perceived to bring.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-based Augmentation for Imbalanced Node Classification on Text-Attributed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Node classification on graphs frequently encounters the challenge of class imbalance, leading to biased performance and posing significant risks in real-world applications. Although several data-centric solutions have been proposed, none of them focus on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), and therefore overlook the potential of leveraging the rich semantics encoded in textual features for boosting the classification of minority nodes. Given this crucial gap, we investigate the possibility of augmenting graph data in the text space, leveraging the textual generation power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle imbalanced node classification on TAGs. Specifically, we propose a novel approach called LA-TAG (LLM-based Augmentation on Text-Attributed Graphs), which prompts LLMs to generate synthetic texts based on existing node texts in the graph. Furthermore, to integrate these synthetic text-attributed nodes into the graph, we introduce a text-based link predictor to connect the synthesized nodes with the existing nodes. Our experiments across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics show that our framework significantly outperforms traditional non-textual-based data augmentation strategies and specific node imbalance solutions. This highlights the promise of using LLMs to resolve imbalance issues on TAGs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization relies on iteratively constructing and optimizing an acquisition function. The latter turns out to be a challenging, non-convex optimization problem itself. Despite the relative importance of this step, most algorithms employ sampling- or gradient-based methods, which do not provably converge to global optima. This work investigates mixed-integer programming (MIP) as a paradigm for \textit{global} acquisition function optimization. Specifically, our Piecewise-linear Kernel Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (PK-MIQP) formulation introduces a piecewise-linear approximation for Gaussian process kernels and admits a corresponding MIQP representation for acquisition functions. We analyze the theoretical regret bounds of the proposed approximation, and empirically demonstrate the framework on synthetic functions, constrained benchmarks, and a hyperparameter tuning task.</description>

      <title>MBD: Multi b-value Denoising of Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to denoising diffusion magnetic resonance images (dMRI) using convolutional neural networks, that exploits the benefits of data acquired at multiple b-values to offset the need for many redundant observations. Denoising is especially relevant in dMRI since noise can have a deleterious impact on both quantification accuracy and image preprocessing. The most successful methods proposed to date, like Marchenko-Pastur Principal Component Analysis (MPPCA) denoising, are tailored to diffusion-weighting repeated for many encoding directions. They exploit high redundancy of the dataset that oversamples the diffusion-encoding direction space, since many directions have collinear components.
  However, there are many dMRI techniques that do not entail a large number of encoding directions or repetitions, and are therefore less suited to this approach. For example, clinical dMRI exams may include as few as three encoding directions, with low or negligible data redundancy across directions. Moreover, promising new dMRI approaches, like spherical b-tensor encoding (STE), benefit from high b-values while sensitizing the signal to diffusion along all directions in just a single shot.
  We introduce a convolutional neural network approach that we call multi-b-value-based denoising (MBD). MBD exploits the similarity in diffusion-weighted images (DWI) across different b-values but along the same diffusion encoding direction. It allows denoising of diffusion images with high noise variance while avoiding blurring, and using just a small number input images.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are already many DNA large language models, but most of them still follow traditional uses, such as extracting sequence features for classification tasks. More innovative applications of large language models, such as prompt engineering, RAG, and zero-shot or few-shot prediction, remain challenging for DNA-based models. The key issue lies in the fact that DNA models and human natural language models are entirely separate; however, techniques like prompt engineering require the use of natural language, thereby significantly limiting the application of DNA large language models. This paper introduces a hybrid model trained on the GPT-2 network, combining DNA sequences and English text to explore the potential of using prompts and fine-tuning in DNA models. The model has demonstrated its effectiveness in DNA related zero-shot prediction and multitask application.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated high reasoning capabilities, drawing attention for their applications as agents in various decision-making processes. One notably promising application of LLM agents is robotic manipulation. Recent research has shown that LLMs can generate text planning or control code for robots, providing substantial flexibility and interaction capabilities. However, these methods still face challenges in terms of flexibility and applicability across different environments, limiting their ability to adapt autonomously. Current approaches typically fall into two categories: those relying on environment-specific policy training, which restricts their transferability, and those generating code actions based on fixed prompts, which leads to diminished performance when confronted with new environments. These limitations significantly constrain the generalizability of agents in robotic manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called EnvBridge. This approach involves the retention and transfer of successful robot control codes from source environments to target environments. EnvBridge enhances the agent's adaptability and performance across diverse settings by leveraging insights from multiple environments. Notably, our approach alleviates environmental constraints, offering a more flexible and generalizable solution for robotic manipulation tasks. We validated the effectiveness of our method using robotic manipulation benchmarks: RLBench, MetaWorld, and CALVIN. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM agents can successfully leverage diverse knowledge sources to solve complex tasks. Consequently, our approach significantly enhances the adaptability and robustness of robotic manipulation agents in planning across diverse environments.</description>

      <title>ISImed: A Framework for Self-Supervised Learning using Intrinsic Spatial Information in Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that spatial information can be used to learn interpretable representations in medical images using Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). Our proposed method, ISImed, is based on the observation that medical images exhibit a much lower variability among different images compared to classic data vision benchmarks. By leveraging this resemblance of human body structures across multiple images, we establish a self-supervised objective that creates a latent representation capable of capturing its location in the physical realm. More specifically, our method involves sampling image crops and creating a distance matrix that compares the learned representation vectors of all possible combinations of these crops to the true distance between them. The intuition is, that the learned latent space is a positional encoding for a given image crop. We hypothesize, that by learning these positional encodings, comprehensive image representations have to be generated. To test this hypothesis and evaluate our method, we compare our learned representation with two state-of-the-art SSL benchmarking methods on two publicly available medical imaging datasets. We show that our method can efficiently learn representations that capture the underlying structure of the data and can be used to transfer to a downstream classification task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the ability of large language models to learn specific mathematical rules such as distributivity or simplifying equations. We present an empirical analysis of their ability to generalize these rules, as well as to reuse them in the context of word problems. For this purpose, we provide a rigorous methodology to build synthetic data incorporating such rules, and perform fine-tuning of large language models on such data. Our experiments show that our model can learn and generalize these rules to some extent, as well as suitably reuse them in the context of word problems.</description>

      <title>Publishing Neural Networks in Drug Discovery Might Compromise Training Data Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the risks of exposing confidential chemical structures when machine learning models trained on these structures are made publicly available. We use membership inference attacks, a common method to assess privacy that is largely unexplored in the context of drug discovery, to examine neural networks for molecular property prediction in a black-box setting. Our results reveal significant privacy risks across all evaluated datasets and neural network architectures. Combining multiple attacks increases these risks. Molecules from minority classes, often the most valuable in drug discovery, are particularly vulnerable. We also found that representing molecules as graphs and using message-passing neural networks may mitigate these risks. We provide a framework to assess privacy risks of classification models and molecular representations. Our findings highlight the need for careful consideration when sharing neural networks trained on proprietary chemical structures, informing organisations and researchers about the trade-offs between data confidentiality and model openness.</description>

      <title>Can a Machine Distinguish High and Low Amount of Social Creak in Speech?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objectives: ncreased prevalence of social creak particularly among female speakers has been reported in several studies. The study of social creak has been previously conducted by combining perceptual evaluation of speech with conventional acoustical parameters such as the harmonic-to-noise ratio and cepstral peak prominence. In the current study, machine learning (ML) was used to automatically distinguish speech of low amount of social creak from speech of high amount of social creak.
  Methods: The amount of creak in continuous speech samples produced in Finnish by 90 female speakers was first perceptually assessed by two voice specialists. Based on their assessments, the speech samples were divided into two categories (low $vs$. high amount of creak). Using the speech signals and their creak labels, seven different ML models were trained. Three spectral representations were used as feature for each model.
  Results: The results show that the best performance (accuracy of 71.1\%) was obtained by the following two systems: an Adaboost classifier using the mel-spectrogram feature and a decision tree classifier using the mel-frequency cepstral coefficient feature.
  Conclusions: The study of social creak is becoming increasingly popular in sociolinguistic and vocological research. The conventional human perceptual assessment of the amount of creak is laborious and therefore ML technology could be used to assist researchers studying social creak. The classification systems reported in this study could be considered as baselines in future ML-based studies on social creak.</description>

      <title>Deep Memory Search: A Metaheuristic Approach for Optimizing Heuristic Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metaheuristic search methods have proven to be essential tools for tackling complex optimization challenges, but their full potential is often constrained by conventional algorithmic frameworks. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Deep Heuristic Search (DHS), which models metaheuristic search as a memory-driven process. DHS employs multiple search layers and memory-based exploration-exploitation mechanisms to navigate large, dynamic search spaces. By utilizing model-free memory representations, DHS enhances the ability to traverse temporal trajectories without relying on probabilistic transition models. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in search efficiency and performance across a range of heuristic optimization problems.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Baseline Models and a Transformer Network for SOC Prediction in Lithium-Ion Batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the state of charge of Lithium-ion batteries is essential to the performance of battery management systems of electric vehicles. One of the main reasons for the slow global adoption of electric cars is driving range anxiety. The ability of a battery management system to accurately estimate the state of charge can help alleviate this problem. In this paper, a comparison between data-driven state-of-charge estimation methods is conducted. The paper compares different neural network-based models and common regression models for SOC estimation. These models include several ablated transformer networks, a neural network, a lasso regression model, a linear regression model and a decision tree. Results of various experiments conducted on data obtained from natural driving cycles of the BMW i3 battery show that the decision tree outperformed all other models including the more complex transformer network with self-attention and positional encoding.</description>

      <title>Neuronal Competition Groups with Supervised STDP for Spike-Based Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) is a promising substitute to backpropagation for local training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware. STDP allows SNNs to address classification tasks by combining unsupervised STDP for feature extraction and supervised STDP for classification. Unsupervised STDP is usually employed with Winner-Takes-All (WTA) competition to learn distinct patterns. However, WTA for supervised STDP classification faces unbalanced competition challenges. In this paper, we propose a method to effectively implement WTA competition in a spiking classification layer employing first-spike coding and supervised STDP training. We introduce the Neuronal Competition Group (NCG), an architecture that improves classification capabilities by promoting the learning of various patterns per class. An NCG is a group of neurons mapped to a specific class, implementing intra-class WTA and a novel competition regulation mechanism based on two-compartment thresholds. We incorporate our proposed architecture into spiking classification layers trained with state-of-the-art supervised STDP rules. On top of two different unsupervised feature extractors, we obtain significant accuracy improvements on image recognition datasets such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. We show that our competition regulation mechanism is crucial for ensuring balanced competition and improved class separation.</description>

      <title>Exploration and Persuasion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How to incentivize self-interested agents to explore when they prefer to exploit? Consider a population of self-interested agents that make decisions under uncertainty. They "explore" to acquire new information and "exploit" this information to make good decisions. Collectively they need to balance these two objectives, but their incentives are skewed toward exploitation. This is because exploration is costly, but its benefits are spread over many agents in the future.
  "Incentivized Exploration" addresses this issue via strategic communication. Consider a benign ``principal" which can communicate with the agents and make recommendations, but cannot force the agents to comply. Moreover, suppose the principal can observe the agents' decisions and the outcomes of these decisions. The goal is to design a communication and recommendation policy which (i) achieves a desirable balance between exploration and exploitation, and (ii) incentivizes the agents to follow recommendations. What makes it feasible is "information asymmetry": the principal knows more than any one agent, as it collects information from many. It is essential that the principal does not fully reveal all its knowledge to the agents.
  Incentivized exploration combines two important problems in, resp., machine learning and theoretical economics. First, if agents always follow recommendations, the principal faces a multi-armed bandit problem: essentially, design an algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation. Second, interaction with a single agent corresponds to "Bayesian persuasion", where a principal leverages information asymmetry to convince an agent to take a particular action. We provide a brief but self-contained introduction to each problem through the lens of incentivized exploration, solving a key special case of the former as a sub-problem of the latter.</description>

      <title>Human-LLM Hybrid Text Answer Aggregation for Crowd Annotations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quality is a crucial issue for crowd annotations. Answer aggregation is an important type of solution. The aggregated answers estimated from multiple crowd answers to the same instance are the eventually collected annotations, rather than the individual crowd answers themselves. Recently, the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) on data annotation tasks has attracted interest from researchers. Most of the existing studies mainly focus on the average performance of individual crowd workers; several recent works studied the scenarios of aggregation on categorical labels and LLMs used as label creators. However, the scenario of aggregation on text answers and the role of LLMs as aggregators are not yet well-studied. In this paper, we investigate the capability of LLMs as aggregators in the scenario of close-ended crowd text answer aggregation. We propose a human-LLM hybrid text answer aggregation method with a Creator-Aggregator Multi-Stage (CAMS) crowdsourcing framework. We make the experiments based on public crowdsourcing datasets. The results show the effectiveness of our approach based on the collaboration of crowd workers and LLMs.</description>

      <title>Exploring RL-based LLM Training for Formal Language Tasks with Programmed Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is commonly used in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback to align large language models (LLMs) with downstream tasks. This paper investigates the feasibility of using PPO for direct reinforcement learning (RL) from explicitly programmed reward signals, as opposed to indirect learning from human feedback via an intermediary reward model. We focus on tasks expressed through formal languages, such as mathematics and programming, where explicit reward functions can be programmed to automatically assess the quality of generated outputs. We apply this approach to a sentiment alignment task, a simple arithmetic task, and a more complex game synthesis task. The sentiment alignment task replicates prior research and serves to validate our experimental setup. Our results show that pure RL-based training for the two formal language tasks is challenging, with success being limited even for the simple arithmetic task. We propose a novel batch-entropy regularization term to aid exploration, although training is not yet entirely stable. Our findings suggest that direct RL training of LLMs may be more suitable for relatively minor changes, such as alignment, than for learning new tasks altogether, even if an informative reward signal can be expressed programmatically.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for exploring generalization errors of transfer learning through the lens of differential calculus on the space of probability measures. In particular, we consider two main transfer learning scenarios, $\alpha$-ERM and fine-tuning with the KL-regularized empirical risk minimization and establish generic conditions under which the generalization error and the population risk convergence rates for these scenarios are studied. Based on our theoretical results, we show the benefits of transfer learning with a one-hidden-layer neural network in the mean-field regime under some suitable integrability and regularity assumptions on the loss and activation functions.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Data-Driven Workflows in Radio Interferometry. I. Principal Demonstration in Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio interferometry is an observational technique used to study astrophysical phenomena. Data gathered by an interferometer requires substantial processing before astronomers can extract the scientific information from it. Data processing consists of a sequence of calibration and analysis procedures where choices must be made about the sequence of procedures as well as the specific configuration of the procedure itself. These choices are typically based on a combination of measurable data characteristics, an understanding of the instrument itself, an appreciation of the trade-offs between compute cost and accuracy, and a learned understanding of what is considered "best practice". A metric of absolute correctness is not always available and validity is often subject to human judgment. The underlying principles and software configurations to discern a reasonable workflow for a given dataset is the subject of training workshops for students and scientists. Our goal is to use objective metrics that quantify best practice, and numerically map out the decision space with respect to our metrics. With these objective metrics we demonstrate an automated, data-driven, decision system that is capable of sequencing the optimal action(s) for processing interferometric data. This paper introduces a simplified description of the principles behind interferometry and the procedures required for data processing. We highlight the issues with current automation approaches and propose our ideas for solving these bottlenecks. A prototype is demonstrated and the results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Can General-Purpose Large Language Models Generalize to English-Thai Machine Translation ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform well on common tasks but struggle with generalization in low-resource and low-computation settings. We examine this limitation by testing various LLMs and specialized translation models on English-Thai machine translation and code-switching datasets. Our findings reveal that under more strict computational constraints, such as 4-bit quantization, LLMs fail to translate effectively. In contrast, specialized models, with comparable or lower computational requirements, consistently outperform LLMs. This underscores the importance of specialized models for maintaining performance under resource constraints.</description>

      <title>Covariance estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the complexity of covariance matrix estimation for Gibbs distributions based on dependent samples from a Markov chain. We show that when $\pi$ satisfies a Poincar\'e inequality and the chain possesses a spectral gap, we can achieve similar sample complexity using MCMC as compared to an estimator constructed using i.i.d. samples, with potentially much better query complexity. As an application of our methods, we show improvements for the query complexity in both constrained and unconstrained settings for concrete instances of MCMC. In particular, we provide guarantees regarding isotropic rounding procedures for sampling uniformly on convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Interchangeable Token Embeddings for Extendable Vocabulary and Alpha-Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for learning interchangeable tokens in language models to obtain an extendable vocabulary that can generalize to new tokens. Our method is designed to address alpha-equivalence, the principle that renaming bound variables in a syntactic expression preserves semantics. This property arises in many formal languages such as temporal logics, in which all proposition symbols represent the same concept but are distinguishable from each other. To handle such tokens, we develop a dual-part embedding approach. The first part is shared across all interchangeable tokens, thereby enforcing that they represent the same core concept. The second part is randomly generated for each token, which enables distinguishability. We evaluate our method in a Transformer encoder-decoder model on two tasks: solving linear temporal logic formulae and copying with extendable vocabulary. Our method demonstrates promising generalization capabilities in addition to introducing a favorable inductive bias for alpha-equivalence.</description>

      <title>Remote Timing Attacks on Efficient Language Model Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling up language models has significantly increased their capabilities. But larger models are slower models, and so there is now an extensive body of work (e.g., speculative sampling or parallel decoding) that improves the (average case) efficiency of language model generation. But these techniques introduce data-dependent timing characteristics. We show it is possible to exploit these timing differences to mount a timing attack. By monitoring the (encrypted) network traffic between a victim user and a remote language model, we can learn information about the content of messages by noting when responses are faster or slower. With complete black-box access, on open source systems we show how it is possible to learn the topic of a user's conversation (e.g., medical advice vs. coding assistance) with 90%+ precision, and on production systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude we can distinguish between specific messages or infer the user's language. We further show that an active adversary can leverage a boosting attack to recover PII placed in messages (e.g., phone numbers or credit card numbers) for open source systems. We conclude with potential defenses and directions for future work.</description>

      <title>Audio-to-Score Conversion Model Based on Whisper methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis develops a Transformer model based on Whisper, which extracts melodies and chords from music audio and records them into ABC notation. A comprehensive data processing workflow is customized for ABC notation, including data cleansing, formatting, and conversion, and a mutation mechanism is implemented to increase the diversity and quality of training data. This thesis innovatively introduces the "Orpheus' Score", a custom notation system that converts music information into tokens, designs a custom vocabulary library, and trains a corresponding custom tokenizer. Experiments show that compared to traditional algorithms, the model has significantly improved accuracy and performance. While providing a convenient audio-to-score tool for music enthusiasts, this work also provides new ideas and tools for research in music information processing.</description>

      <title>Neuroevolution Neural Architecture Search for Evolving RNNs in Stock Return Prediction and Portfolio Trading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stock return forecasting is a major component of numerous finance applications. Predicted stock returns can be incorporated into portfolio trading algorithms to make informed buy or sell decisions which can optimize returns. In such portfolio trading applications, the predictive performance of a time series forecasting model is crucial. In this work, we propose the use of the Evolutionary eXploration of Augmenting Memory Models (EXAMM) algorithm to progressively evolve recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for stock return predictions. RNNs are evolved independently for each stocks and portfolio trading decisions are made based on the predicted stock returns. The portfolio used for testing consists of the 30 companies in the Dow-Jones Index (DJI) with each stock have the same weight. Results show that using these evolved RNNs and a simple daily long-short strategy can generate higher returns than both the DJI index and the S&amp;P 500 Index for both 2022 (bear market) and 2023 (bull market).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), a popular model for multi-agent control, pose a significant challenge to efficient learning due to the exponential growth of the global state-action space with the number of agents. In this work, utilizing the exponential decay property of network dynamics, we first derive scalable spectral local representations for network MDPs, which induces a network linear subspace for the local $Q$-function of each agent. Building on these local spectral representations, we design a scalable algorithmic framework for continuous state-action network MDPs, and provide end-to-end guarantees for the convergence of our algorithm. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of our scalable representation-based approach on two benchmark problems, and demonstrate the advantages of our approach over generic function approximation approaches to representing the local $Q$-functions.</description>

      <title>Dhoroni: Exploring Bengali Climate Change and Environmental Views with a Multi-Perspective News Dataset and Natural Language Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change poses critical challenges globally, disproportionately affecting low-income countries that often lack resources and linguistic representation on the international stage. Despite Bangladesh's status as one of the most vulnerable nations to climate impacts, research gaps persist in Bengali-language studies related to climate change and NLP. To address this disparity, we introduce Dhoroni, a novel Bengali (Bangla) climate change and environmental news dataset, comprising a 2300 annotated Bangla news articles, offering multiple perspectives such as political influence, scientific/statistical data, authenticity, stance detection, and stakeholder involvement. Furthermore, we present an in-depth exploratory analysis of Dhoroni and introduce BanglaBERT-Dhoroni family, a novel baseline model family for climate and environmental opinion detection in Bangla, fine-tuned on our dataset. This research contributes significantly to enhancing accessibility and analysis of climate discourse in Bengali (Bangla), addressing crucial communication and research gaps in climate-impacted regions like Bangladesh with 180 million people.</description>

      <title>Optimal Robust Estimation under Local and Global Corruptions: Stronger Adversary and Smaller Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic robust statistics has traditionally focused on the contamination model where a small fraction of the samples are arbitrarily corrupted. We consider a recent contamination model that combines two kinds of corruptions: (i) small fraction of arbitrary outliers, as in classical robust statistics, and (ii) local perturbations, where samples may undergo bounded shifts on average. While each noise model is well understood individually, the combined contamination model poses new algorithmic challenges, with only partial results known. Existing efficient algorithms are limited in two ways: (i) they work only for a weak notion of local perturbations, and (ii) they obtain suboptimal error for isotropic subgaussian distributions (among others). The latter limitation led [NGS24, COLT'24] to hypothesize that improving the error might, in fact, be computationally hard. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that information theoretically optimal error can indeed be achieved in polynomial time, under an even \emph{stronger} local perturbation model (the sliced-Wasserstein metric as opposed to the Wasserstein metric). Notably, our analysis reveals that the entire family of stability-based robust mean estimators continues to work optimally in a black-box manner for the combined contamination model. This generalization is particularly useful in real-world scenarios where the specific form of data corruption is not known in advance. We also present efficient algorithms for distribution learning and principal component analysis in the combined contamination model.</description>

      <title>Few-shot In-Context Preference Learning Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing reward functions is a core component of reinforcement learning but can be challenging for truly complex behavior. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been used to alleviate this challenge by replacing a hand-coded reward function with a reward function learned from preferences. However, it can be exceedingly inefficient to learn these rewards as they are often learned tabula rasa. We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can reduce this query inefficiency by converting an iterative series of human preferences into code representing the rewards. We propose In-Context Preference Learning (ICPL), a method that uses the grounding of an LLM to accelerate learning reward functions from preferences. ICPL takes the environment context and task description, synthesizes a set of reward functions, and then repeatedly updates the reward functions using human rankings of videos of the resultant policies. Using synthetic preferences, we demonstrate that ICPL is orders of magnitude more efficient than RLHF and is even competitive with methods that use ground-truth reward functions instead of preferences. Finally, we perform a series of human preference-learning trials and observe that ICPL extends beyond synthetic settings and can work effectively with humans-in-the-loop. Additional information and videos are provided at https://sites.google.com/view/few-shot-icpl/home.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Large Language Models to Appropriately Abstain with Semantic Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate, whereby they generate plausible but inaccurate text. This phenomenon poses significant risks in critical applications, such as medicine or law, necessitating robust hallucination mitigation strategies. While recent works have proposed fine-tuning methods to teach LLMs to abstain from answering questions beyond their knowledge or capabilities, these methods rely on the existence of ground-truth labels or are limited to short-form responses. To address these limitations, we propose fine-tuning using semantic entropy, an uncertainty measure derived from introspection into the model which does not require external labels. We demonstrate that our approach matches or outperforms models fine-tuned using prior work and achieves strong performance for both short and long-form generations on a range of datasets.</description>

      <title>SELA: Tree-Search Enhanced LLM Agents for Automated Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) approaches encompass traditional methods that optimize fixed pipelines for model selection and ensembling, as well as newer LLM-based frameworks that autonomously build pipelines. While LLM-based agents have shown promise in automating machine learning tasks, they often generate low-diversity and suboptimal code, even after multiple iterations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Tree-Search Enhanced LLM Agents (SELA), an innovative agent-based system that leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the AutoML process. By representing pipeline configurations as trees, our framework enables agents to conduct experiments intelligently and iteratively refine their strategies, facilitating a more effective exploration of the machine learning solution space. This novel approach allows SELA to discover optimal pathways based on experimental feedback, improving the overall quality of the solutions. In an extensive evaluation across 20 machine learning datasets, we compare the performance of traditional and agent-based AutoML methods, demonstrating that SELA achieves a win rate of 65% to 80% against each baseline across all datasets. These results underscore the significant potential of agent-based strategies in AutoML, offering a fresh perspective on tackling complex machine learning challenges.</description>

      <title>LVSM: A Large View Synthesis Model with Minimal 3D Inductive Bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the Large View Synthesis Model (LVSM), a novel transformer-based approach for scalable and generalizable novel view synthesis from sparse-view inputs. We introduce two architectures: (1) an encoder-decoder LVSM, which encodes input image tokens into a fixed number of 1D latent tokens, functioning as a fully learned scene representation, and decodes novel-view images from them; and (2) a decoder-only LVSM, which directly maps input images to novel-view outputs, completely eliminating intermediate scene representations. Both models bypass the 3D inductive biases used in previous methods -- from 3D representations (e.g., NeRF, 3DGS) to network designs (e.g., epipolar projections, plane sweeps) -- addressing novel view synthesis with a fully data-driven approach. While the encoder-decoder model offers faster inference due to its independent latent representation, the decoder-only LVSM achieves superior quality, scalability, and zero-shot generalization, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by 1.5 to 3.5 dB PSNR. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate that both LVSM variants achieve state-of-the-art novel view synthesis quality. Notably, our models surpass all previous methods even with reduced computational resources (1-2 GPUs).

      <description>arXiv:2203.09659v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{F}_{n,d}$ be the class of all functions $f:\{-1,1\}^n\to[-1,1]$ on the $n$-dimensional discrete hypercube of degree at most $d$. In the first part of this paper, we prove that any (deterministic or randomized) algorithm which learns $\mathscr{F}_{n,d}$ with $L_2$-accuracy $\varepsilon$ requires at least $\Omega((1-\sqrt{\varepsilon})2^d\log n)$ queries for large enough $n$, thus establishing the sharpness as $n\to\infty$ of a recent upper bound of Eskenazis and Ivanisvili (2021). To do this, we show that the $L_2$-packing numbers $\mathsf{M}(\mathscr{F}_{n,d},\|\cdot\|_{L_2},\varepsilon)$ of the concept class $\mathscr{F}_{n,d}$ satisfy the two-sided estimate $$c(1-\varepsilon)2^d\log n \leq \log \mathsf{M}(\mathscr{F}_{n,d},\|\cdot\|_{L_2},\varepsilon) \leq \frac{2^{Cd}\log n}{\varepsilon^4}$$ for large enough $n$, where $c, C&gt;0$ are universal constants. In the second part of the paper, we present a logarithmic upper bound for the randomized query complexity of classes of bounded approximate polynomials whose Fourier spectra are concentrated on few subsets. As an application, we prove new estimates for the number of random queries required to learn approximate juntas of a given degree, functions with rapidly decaying Fourier tails and constant depth circuits of given size. Finally, we obtain bounds for the number of queries required to learn the polynomial class $\mathscr{F}_{n,d}$ without error in the query and random example models.</description>

      <title>Multimodal hierarchical Variational AutoEncoders with Factor Analysis latent space</title>

Abstract: Purpose: Handling heterogeneous and mixed data types has become increasingly critical with the exponential growth in real-world databases. While deep generative models attempt to merge diverse data views into a common latent space, they often sacrifice interpretability, flexibility, and modularity. This study proposes a novel method to address these limitations by combining Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) with a Factor Analysis latent space (FA-VAE).
  Methods: The proposed FA-VAE method employs multiple VAEs to learn a private representation for each heterogeneous data view in a continuous latent space. Information is shared between views using a low-dimensional latent space, generated via a linear projection matrix. This modular design creates a hierarchical dependency between private and shared latent spaces, allowing for the flexible addition of new views and conditioning of pre-trained models.
  Results: The FA-VAE approach facilitates cross-generation of data from different domains and enables transfer learning between generative models. This allows for effective integration of information across diverse data views while preserving their distinct characteristics.
  Conclusions: By overcoming the limitations of existing methods, the FA-VAE provides a more interpretable, flexible, and modular solution for managing heterogeneous data types. It offers a pathway to more efficient and scalable data-handling strategies, enhancing the potential for cross-domain data synthesis and model transferability.</description>

      <title>BeGin: Extensive Benchmark Scenarios and An Easy-to-use Framework for Graph Continual Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14568v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is the process of learning ceaselessly a sequence of tasks. Most existing CL methods deal with independent data (e.g., images and text) for which many benchmark frameworks and results under standard experimental settings are available. Compared to them, however, CL methods for graph data (graph CL) are relatively underexplored because of (a) the lack of standard experimental settings, especially regarding how to deal with the dependency between instances, (b) the lack of benchmark datasets and scenarios, and (c) high complexity in implementation and evaluation due to the dependency. In this paper, regarding (a) we define four standard incremental settings (task-, class-, domain-, and time-incremental) for node-, link-, and graph-level problems, extending the previously explored scope. Regarding (b), we provide 35 benchmark scenarios based on 24 real-world graphs. Regarding (c), we develop BeGin, an easy and fool-proof framework for graph CL. BeGin is easily extended since it is modularized with reusable modules for data processing, algorithm design, and evaluation. Especially, the evaluation module is completely separated from user code to eliminate potential mistakes. Regarding benchmark results, we cover 3x more combinations of incremental settings and levels of problems than the latest benchmark. All assets for the benchmark framework are publicly available at https://github.com/ShinhwanKang/BeGin.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the problem of online collaborative filtering under no-repetition constraints, whereby users need to be served content in an online fashion and a given user cannot be recommended the same content item more than once. We start by designing and analyzing an algorithm that works under biclustering assumptions on the user-item preference matrix, and show that this algorithm exhibits an optimal regret guarantee, while being fully adaptive, in that it is oblivious to any prior knowledge about the sequence of users, the universe of items, as well as the biclustering parameters of the preference matrix. We then propose a more robust version of this algorithm which operates with general matrices. Also this algorithm is parameter free, and we prove regret guarantees that scale with the amount by which the preference matrix deviates from a biclustered structure. To our knowledge, these are the first results on online collaborative filtering that hold at this level of generality and adaptivity under no-repetition constraints. Finally, we complement our theoretical findings with simple experiments on real-world datasets aimed at both validating the theory and empirically comparing to standard baselines. This comparison shows the competitive advantage of our approach over these baselines.</description>

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification and robustness to distribution shifts are important goals in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Although Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) allow for uncertainty in the predictions to be assessed, different sources of predictive uncertainty cannot be distinguished properly. We present Credal Bayesian Deep Learning (CBDL). Heuristically, CBDL allows to train an (uncountably) infinite ensemble of BNNs, using only finitely many elements. This is possible thanks to prior and likelihood finitely generated credal sets (FGCSs), a concept from the imprecise probability literature. Intuitively, convex combinations of a finite collection of prior-likelihood pairs are able to represent infinitely many such pairs. After training, CBDL outputs a set of posteriors on the parameters of the neural network. At inference time, such posterior set is used to derive a set of predictive distributions that is in turn utilized to distinguish between (predictive) aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and to quantify them. The predictive set also produces either (i) a collection of outputs enjoying desirable probabilistic guarantees, or (ii) the single output that is deemed the best, that is, the one having the highest predictive lower probability -- another imprecise-probabilistic concept. CBDL is more robust than single BNNs to prior and likelihood misspecification, and to distribution shift. We show that CBDL is better at quantifying and disentangling different types of (predictive) uncertainties than single BNNs and ensemble of BNNs. In addition, we apply CBDL to two case studies to demonstrate its downstream tasks capabilities: one, for motion prediction in autonomous driving scenarios, and two, to model blood glucose and insulin dynamics for artificial pancreas control. We show that CBDL performs better when compared to an ensemble of BNNs baseline.</description>

Abstract: Sparse graph recovery methods work well where the data follows their assumptions but often they are not designed for doing downstream probabilistic queries. This limits their adoption to only identifying connections among the input variables. On the other hand, the Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) assume an underlying base graph between variables and learns a distribution over them. PGM design choices are carefully made such that the inference \&amp; sampling algorithms are efficient. This brings in certain restrictions and often simplifying assumptions. In this work, we propose Neural Graph Revealers (NGRs), that are an attempt to efficiently merge the sparse graph recovery methods with PGMs into a single flow. The problem setting consists of an input data X with D features and M samples and the task is to recover a sparse graph showing connection between the features and jointly learn a probability distribution over them. NGRs view the neural networks as a `glass box' or more specifically as a multitask learning framework. We introduce `Graph-constrained path norm' that NGRs leverage to learn a graphical model that captures complex non-linear functional dependencies between the features in the form of an undirected sparse graph. Furthermore, NGRs can handle multimodal inputs like images, text, categorical data, embeddings etc. which is not straightforward to incorporate in the existing methods. We show experimental results of doing sparse graph recovery and probabilistic inference on data from Gaussian graphical models and a multimodal infant mortality dataset by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</description>

Abstract: We frequently encounter multiple series that are temporally correlated in our surroundings, such as EEG data to examine alterations in brain activity or sensors to monitor body movements. Segmentation of multivariate time series data is a technique for identifying meaningful patterns or changes in the time series that can signal a shift in the system's behavior. However, most segmentation algorithms have been designed primarily for univariate time series, and their performance on multivariate data remains largely unsatisfactory, making this a challenging problem. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for multivariate time series segmentation using conditional independence (CI) graphs. CI graphs are probabilistic graphical models that represents the partial correlations between the nodes. We propose a domain agnostic multivariate segmentation framework $\texttt{tGLAD}$ which draws a parallel between the CI graph nodes and the variables of the time series. Consider applying a graph recovery model $\texttt{uGLAD}$ to a short interval of the time series, it will result in a CI graph that shows partial correlations among the variables. We extend this idea to the entire time series by utilizing a sliding window to create a batch of time intervals and then run a single $\texttt{uGLAD}$ model in multitask learning mode to recover all the CI graphs simultaneously. As a result, we obtain a corresponding temporal CI graphs representation. We then designed a first-order and second-order based trajectory tracking algorithms to study the evolution of these graphs across distinct intervals. Finally, an `Allocation' algorithm is used to determine a suitable segmentation of the temporal graph sequence. $\texttt{tGLAD}$ provides a competitive time complexity of $O(N)$ for settings where number of variables $D&lt;&lt;N$. We demonstrate successful empirical results on a Physical Activity Monitoring data.</description>

      <title>Forgettable Federated Linear Learning with Certified Data Unlearning</title>

Abstract: The advent of Federated Learning (FL) has revolutionized the way distributed systems handle collaborative model training while preserving user privacy. Recently, Federated Unlearning (FU) has emerged to address demands for the "right to be forgotten"" and unlearning of the impact of poisoned clients without requiring retraining in FL. Most FU algorithms require the cooperation of retained or target clients (clients to be unlearned), introducing additional communication overhead and potential security risks. In addition, some FU methods need to store historical models to execute the unlearning process. These challenges hinder the efficiency and memory constraints of the current FU methods. Moreover, due to the complexity of nonlinear models and their training strategies, most existing FU methods for deep neural networks (DNN) lack theoretical certification. In this work, we introduce a novel FL training and unlearning strategy in DNN, termed Forgettable Federated Linear Learning (F^2L^2). F^2L^2 considers a common practice of using pre-trained models to approximate DNN linearly, allowing them to achieve similar performance as the original networks via Federated Linear Training (FLT). We then present FedRemoval, a certified, efficient, and secure unlearning strategy that enables the server to unlearn a target client without requiring client communication or adding additional storage. We have conducted extensive empirical validation on small- to large-scale datasets, using both convolutional neural networks and modern foundation models. These experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of F^2L^2 in balancing model accuracy with the successful unlearning of target clients. F^2L^2 represents a promising pipeline for efficient and trustworthy FU. The code is available here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MAAD, a novel, sample-efficient on-policy algorithm for Imitation Learning from Observations. MAAD utilizes a surrogate reward signal, which can be derived from various sources such as adversarial games, trajectory matching objectives, or optimal transport criteria. To compensate for the non-availability of expert actions, we rely on an inverse dynamics model that infers plausible actions distribution given the expert's state-state transitions; we regularize the imitator's policy by aligning it to the inferred action distribution. MAAD leads to significantly improved sample efficiency and stability. We demonstrate its effectiveness in a number of MuJoCo environments, both int the OpenAI Gym and the DeepMind Control Suite. We show that it requires considerable fewer interactions to achieve expert performance, outperforming current state-of-the-art on-policy methods. Remarkably, MAAD often stands out as the sole method capable of attaining expert performance levels, underscoring its simplicity and efficacy.</description>

      <title>One-Versus-Others Attention: Scalable Multimodal Integration for Biomedical Data</title>

Abstract: Multimodal learning models have become increasingly important as they surpass single-modality approaches on diverse tasks ranging from question-answering to autonomous driving. Despite the importance of multimodal learning, existing efforts focus on NLP applications, where the number of modalities is typically less than four (audio, video, text, images). However, data inputs in other domains, such as the medical field, may include X-rays, PET scans, MRIs, genetic screening, clinical notes, and more, creating a need for both efficient and accurate information fusion. Many state-of-the-art models rely on pairwise cross-modal attention, which does not scale well for applications with more than three modalities. For $n$ modalities, computing attention will result in $n \choose 2$ operations, potentially requiring considerable amounts of computational resources. To address this, we propose a new domain-neutral attention mechanism, One-Versus-Others (OvO) attention, that scales linearly with the number of modalities and requires only $n$ attention operations, thus offering a significant reduction in computational complexity compared to existing cross-modal attention algorithms. Using three diverse real-world datasets as well as an additional simulation experiment, we show that our method improves performance compared to popular fusion techniques while decreasing computation costs.</description>

      <title>SMARLA: A Safety Monitoring Approach for Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has made significant advancements in various fields, such as autonomous driving, healthcare, and robotics, by enabling agents to learn optimal policies through interactions with their environments. However, the application of DRL in safety-critical domains presents challenges, particularly concerning the safety of the learned policies. DRL agents, which are focused on maximizing rewards, may select unsafe actions, leading to safety violations. Runtime safety monitoring is thus essential to ensure the safe operation of these agents, especially in unpredictable and dynamic environments. This paper introduces SMARLA, a black-box safety monitoring approach specifically designed for DRL agents. SMARLA utilizes machine learning to predict safety violations by observing the agent's behavior during execution. The approach is based on Q-values, which reflect the expected reward for taking actions in specific states. SMARLA employs state abstraction to reduce the complexity of the state space, enhancing the predictive capabilities of the monitoring model. Such abstraction enables the early detection of unsafe states, allowing for the implementation of corrective and preventive measures before incidents occur. We quantitatively and qualitatively validated SMARLA on three well-known case studies widely used in DRL research. Empirical results reveal that SMARLA is accurate at predicting safety violations, with a low false positive rate, and can predict violations at an early stage, approximately halfway through the execution of the agent, before violations occur. We also discuss different decision criteria, based on confidence intervals of the predicted violation probabilities, to trigger safety mechanisms aiming at a trade-off between early detection and low false positive rates.</description>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) addresses the need to create models based on proprietary data in such a way that multiple clients retain exclusive control over their data, while all benefit from improved model accuracy due to pooled resources. Recently proposed Neural Graphical Models (NGMs) are Probabilistic Graphical models that utilize the expressive power of neural networks to learn complex non-linear dependencies between the input features. They learn to capture the underlying data distribution and have efficient algorithms for inference and sampling. We develop a FL framework which maintains a global NGM model that learns the averaged information from the local NGM models while keeping the training data within the client's environment. Our design, FedNGMs, avoids the pitfalls and shortcomings of neuron matching frameworks like Federated Matched Averaging that suffers from model parameter explosion. Our global model size remains constant throughout the process. In the cases where clients have local variables that are not part of the combined global distribution, we propose a `Stitching' algorithm, which personalizes the global NGM models by merging the additional variables using the client's data. FedNGM is robust to data heterogeneity, large number of participants, and limited communication bandwidth. We experimentally demonstrated the use of FedNGMs for extracting insights from CDC's Infant Mortality dataset and discuss interesting future applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce StochGradAdam, a novel optimizer designed as an extension of the Adam algorithm, incorporating stochastic gradient sampling techniques to improve computational efficiency while maintaining robust performance. StochGradAdam optimizes by selectively sampling a subset of gradients during training, reducing the computational cost while preserving the advantages of adaptive learning rates and bias corrections found in Adam. Our experimental results, applied to image classification and segmentation tasks, demonstrate that StochGradAdam can achieve comparable or superior performance to Adam, even when using fewer gradient updates per iteration. By focusing on key gradient updates, StochGradAdam offers stable convergence and enhanced exploration of the loss landscape, while mitigating the impact of noisy gradients. The results suggest that this approach is particularly effective for large-scale models and datasets, providing a promising alternative to traditional optimization techniques for deep learning applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks often exhibit simplicity bias, favoring simpler features over more complex ones, even when both are equally predictive. We introduce a novel method called imbalanced label coupling to explore and extend this simplicity bias across multiple hierarchical levels. Our approach demonstrates that trained networks sequentially consider features of increasing complexity based on their correlation with labels in the training set, regardless of their actual predictive power. For example, in CIFAR-10, simple spurious features can cause misclassifications where most cats are predicted as dogs and most trucks as automobiles. We empirically show that last-layer retraining with target data distribution \citep{kirichenko2022last} is insufficient to fully recover core features when spurious features perfectly correlate with target labels in our synthetic datasets. Our findings deepen the understanding of the implicit biases inherent in neural networks.</description>

      <title>Causal Fairness under Unobserved Confounding: A Neural Sensitivity Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fairness for machine learning predictions is widely required in practice for legal, ethical, and societal reasons. Existing work typically focuses on settings without unobserved confounding, even though unobserved confounding can lead to severe violations of causal fairness and, thus, unfair predictions. In this work, we analyze the sensitivity of causal fairness to unobserved confounding. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we derive bounds for causal fairness metrics under different sources of unobserved confounding. This enables practitioners to examine the sensitivity of their machine learning models to unobserved confounding in fairness-critical applications. Second, we propose a novel neural framework for learning fair predictions, which allows us to offer worst-case guarantees of the extent to which causal fairness can be violated due to unobserved confounding. Third, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in a series of experiments, including a real-world case study about predicting prison sentences. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to study causal fairness under unobserved confounding. To this end, our work is of direct practical value as a refutation strategy to ensure the fairness of predictions in high-stakes applications.</description>

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a subject of significant scientific and industrial importance. Despite the widespread utilization of forecasting methods, there is a dearth of research aimed at comprehending the conditions under which these methods yield favorable or unfavorable performances. Empirical studies, although common, are challenged by the limited availability of time series datasets, restricting the extraction of reliable insights. To address this limitation, we present tsMorph, a tool for generating semi-synthetic time series through dataset morphing. tsMorph works by creating a sequence of datasets from two original datasets. The characteristics of the generated datasets progressively depart from those of one of the datasets and converge toward the attributes of the other dataset. This method provides a valuable alternative for obtaining substantial datasets. In this paper, we show the benefits of tsMorph by assessing the predictive performance of the Long Short-Term Memory Network and DeepAR forecasting algorithms. The time series used for the experiments comes from the NN5 Competition. The experimental results provide important insights. Notably, the performances of the two algorithms improve proportionally with the frequency of the time series. These experiments confirm that tsMorph can be an effective tool for better understanding the behavior of forecasting algorithms, delivering a pathway to overcoming the limitations posed by empirical studies and enabling more extensive and reliable experiments.</description>

      <title>Universal approximation property of Banach space-valued random feature models including random neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a Banach space-valued extension of random feature learning, a data-driven supervised machine learning technique for large-scale kernel approximation. By randomly initializing the feature maps, only the linear readout needs to be trained, which reduces the computational complexity substantially. Viewing random feature models as Banach space-valued random variables, we prove a universal approximation result in the corresponding Bochner space. Moreover, we derive approximation rates and an explicit algorithm to learn an element of the given Banach space by such models. The framework of this paper includes random trigonometric/Fourier regression and in particular random neural networks which are single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks whose weights and biases are randomly initialized, whence only the linear readout needs to be trained. For the latter, we can then lift the universal approximation property of deterministic neural networks to random neural networks, even within function spaces over non-compact domains, e.g., weighted spaces, $L^p$-spaces, and (weighted) Sobolev spaces, where the latter includes the approximation of the (weak) derivatives. In addition, we analyze when the training costs for approximating a given function grow polynomially in both the input/output dimension and the reciprocal of a pre-specified tolerated approximation error. Furthermore, we demonstrate in a numerical example the empirical advantages of random feature models over their deterministic counterparts.</description>

      <title>Improving Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with Efficient Reward Model Ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely adopted approach for aligning large language models with human values. However, RLHF relies on a reward model that is trained with a limited amount of human preference data, which could lead to inaccurate predictions. As a result, RLHF may produce outputs that are misaligned with human values. To mitigate this issue, we contribute a reward ensemble method that allows the reward model to make more accurate predictions. As using an ensemble of large language model-based reward models can be computationally and resource-expensive, we explore efficient ensemble methods including linear-layer ensemble and LoRA-based ensemble. Empirically, we run Best-of-$n$ and Proximal Policy Optimization with our ensembled reward models, and verify that our ensemble methods help improve the alignment performance of RLHF outputs.</description>

      <title>Adaptive $Q$-Aid for Conditional Supervised Learning in Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has progressed with return-conditioned supervised learning (RCSL), but its lack of stitching ability remains a limitation. We introduce $Q$-Aided Conditional Supervised Learning (QCS), which effectively combines the stability of RCSL with the stitching capability of $Q$-functions. By analyzing $Q$-function over-generalization, which impairs stable stitching, QCS adaptively integrates $Q$-aid into RCSL's loss function based on trajectory return. Empirical results show that QCS significantly outperforms RCSL and value-based methods, consistently achieving or exceeding the maximum trajectory returns across diverse offline RL benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Online Structured Prediction with Fenchel--Young Losses and Improved Surrogate Regret for Online Multiclass Classification with Logistic Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies online structured prediction with full-information feedback. For online multiclass classification, Van der Hoeven (2020) established \emph{finite} surrogate regret bounds, which are independent of the time horizon, by introducing an elegant \emph{exploit-the-surrogate-gap} framework. However, this framework has been limited to multiclass classification primarily because it relies on a classification-specific procedure for converting estimated scores to outputs. We extend the exploit-the-surrogate-gap framework to online structured prediction with \emph{Fenchel--Young losses}, a large family of surrogate losses that includes the logistic loss for multiclass classification as a special case, obtaining finite surrogate regret bounds in various structured prediction problems. To this end, we propose and analyze \emph{randomized decoding}, which converts estimated scores to general structured outputs. Moreover, by applying our decoding to online multiclass classification with the logistic loss, we obtain a surrogate regret bound of $O(\| \mathbf{U} \|_\mathrm{F}^2)$, where $\mathbf{U}$ is the best offline linear estimator and $\| \cdot \|_\mathrm{F}$ denotes the Frobenius norm. This bound is tight up to logarithmic factors and improves the previous bound of $O(d\| \mathbf{U} \|_\mathrm{F}^2)$ due to Van der Hoeven (2020) by a factor of $d$, the number of classes.</description>

Abstract: We discovered that the neural networks, especially the deep ReLU networks, demonstrate an `over-generalization' phenomenon. That is, the output values for the inputs that were not seen during training are mapped close to the output range that were observed during the learning process. In other words, the neural networks learn a many-to-one mapping and this effect is more prominent as we increase the number of layers or the depth of the neural network. We utilize this property of neural networks to design a dataset kaleidoscope, termed as `Generative Kaleidoscopic Networks'. Succinctly, if we learn a model to map from input $x\in\mathbb{R}^D$ to itself $f_\mathcal{N}(x)\rightarrow x$, the proposed `Kaleidoscopic sampling' procedure starts with a random input noise $z\in\mathbb{R}^D$ and recursively applies $f_\mathcal{N}(\cdots f_\mathcal{N}(z)\cdots )$. After a burn-in period duration, we start observing samples from the input distribution and the quality of samples recovered improves as we increase the depth of the model. Scope: We observed this phenomenon to various degrees for the other deep learning architectures like CNNs, Transformers &amp; U-Nets and we are currently investigating them further.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation-Based Model Extraction Attack using GAN-based Private Counterfactual Explanations</title>

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the deployment of machine learning (ML) models as services (MLaaS) across diverse production software applications. In parallel, explainable AI (XAI) continues to evolve, addressing the necessity for transparency and trustworthiness in ML models. XAI techniques aim to enhance the transparency of ML models by providing insights, in terms of model's explanations, into their decision-making process. Simultaneously, some MLaaS platforms now offer explanations alongside the ML prediction outputs. This setup has elevated concerns regarding vulnerabilities in MLaaS, particularly in relation to privacy leakage attacks such as model extraction attacks (MEA). This is due to the fact that explanations can unveil insights about the inner workings of the model which could be exploited by malicious users. In this work, we focus on investigating how model explanations, particularly counterfactual explanations (CFs), can be exploited for performing MEA within the MLaaS platform. We also delve into assessing the effectiveness of incorporating differential privacy (DP) as a mitigation strategy. To this end, we first propose a novel approach for MEA based on Knowledge Distillation (KD) to enhance the efficiency of extracting a substitute model of a target model exploiting CFs, without any knowledge about the training data distribution by the attacker. Then, we advise an approach for training CF generators incorporating DP to generate private CFs. We conduct thorough experimental evaluations on real-world datasets and demonstrate that our proposed KD-based MEA can yield a high-fidelity substitute model with a reduced number of queries with respect to baseline approaches. Furthermore, our findings reveal that including a privacy layer can allow mitigating the MEA. However, on the account of the quality of CFs, impacts the performance of the explanations.</description>

      <title>A Self-Organizing Clustering System for Unsupervised Distribution Shift Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling non-stationary data is a challenging problem in the field of continual learning, and data distribution shifts may result in negative consequences on the performance of a machine learning model. Classic learning tools are often vulnerable to perturbations of the input covariates, and are sensitive to outliers and noise, and some tools are based on rigid algebraic assumptions. Distribution shifts are frequently occurring due to changes in raw materials for production, seasonality, a different user base, or even adversarial attacks. Therefore, there is a need for more effective distribution shift detection techniques. In this work, we propose a continual learning framework for monitoring and detecting distribution changes. We explore the problem in a latent space generated by a bio-inspired self-organizing clustering and statistical aspects of the latent space. In particular, we investigate the projections made by two topology-preserving maps: the Self-Organizing Map and the Scale Invariant Map. Our method can be applied in both a supervised and an unsupervised context. We construct the assessment of changes in the data distribution as a comparison of Gaussian signals, making the proposed method fast and robust. We compare it to other unsupervised techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Kernel-PCA. Our comparison involves conducting experiments using sequences of images (based on MNIST and injected shifts with adversarial samples), chemical sensor measurements, and the environmental variable related to ozone levels. The empirical study reveals the potential of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Economic Impact of Rationality through Reinforcement Learning and Agent-Based Modelling</title>

Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) are simulation models used in economics to overcome some of the limitations of traditional frameworks based on general equilibrium assumptions. However, agents within an ABM follow predetermined 'bounded rational' behavioural rules which can be cumbersome to design and difficult to justify. Here we leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) to expand the capabilities of ABMs with the introduction of 'fully rational' agents that learn their policy by interacting with the environment and maximising a reward function. Specifically, we propose a 'Rational macro ABM' (R-MABM) framework by extending a paradigmatic macro ABM from the economic literature. We show that gradually substituting ABM firms in the model with RL agents, trained to maximise profits, allows for studying the impact of rationality on the economy. We find that RL agents spontaneously learn three distinct strategies for maximising profits, with the optimal strategy depending on the level of market competition and rationality. We also find that RL agents with independent policies, and without the ability to communicate with each other, spontaneously learn to segregate into different strategic groups, thus increasing market power and overall profits. Finally, we find that a higher number of rational (RL) agents in the economy always improves the macroeconomic environment as measured by total output. Depending on the specific rational policy, this can come at the cost of higher instability. Our R-MABM framework allows for stable multi-agent learning, is available in open source, and represents a principled and robust direction to extend economic simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In environments with delayed observation, state augmentation by including actions within the delay window is adopted to retrieve Markovian property to enable reinforcement learning (RL). However, state-of-the-art (SOTA) RL techniques with Temporal-Difference (TD) learning frameworks often suffer from learning inefficiency, due to the significant expansion of the augmented state space with the delay. To improve learning efficiency without sacrificing performance, this work introduces a novel framework called Variational Delayed Policy Optimization (VDPO), which reformulates delayed RL as a variational inference problem. This problem is further modelled as a two-step iterative optimization problem, where the first step is TD learning in the delay-free environment with a small state space, and the second step is behaviour cloning which can be addressed much more efficiently than TD learning. We not only provide a theoretical analysis of VDPO in terms of sample complexity and performance, but also empirically demonstrate that VDPO can achieve consistent performance with SOTA methods, with a significant enhancement of sample efficiency (approximately 50\% less amount of samples) in the MuJoCo benchmark.</description>

      <title>Thinking Forward: Memory-Efficient Federated Finetuning of Language Models</title>

Abstract: Finetuning large language models (LLMs) in federated learning (FL) settings has become increasingly important as it allows resource-constrained devices to finetune a model using private data. However, finetuning LLMs using backpropagation requires excessive memory (especially from intermediate activations) for resource-constrained devices. While Forward-mode Auto-Differentiation (AD) can significantly reduce memory footprint from activations, we observe that directly applying it to LLM finetuning results in slow convergence and poor accuracy. In this paper, we introduce Spry, an FL algorithm that splits trainable weights of an LLM among participating clients, such that each client computes gradients using forward-mode AD that are closer estimations of the true gradients. Spry achieves a low memory footprint, high accuracy, and fast convergence. We formally prove that the global gradients in Spry are unbiased estimators of true global gradients for homogeneous data distributions across clients, while heterogeneity increases bias of the estimates. We also derive Spry's convergence rate, showing that the gradients decrease inversely proportional to the number of FL rounds, indicating the convergence up to the limits of heterogeneity. Empirically, Spry reduces the memory footprint during training by 1.4-7.1x in contrast to backpropagation, while reaching comparable accuracy, across a wide range of language tasks, models, and FL settings. Spry reduces the convergence time by 1.2-20.3x and achieves 5.2-13.5% higher accuracy against zero-order methods. When finetuning Llama2-7B with LoRA, compared to the peak memory consumption of 33.9GB of backpropagation, Spry only consumes 6.2GB of peak memory. For OPT13B, the reduction is from 76.5GB to 10.8GB. Spry makes feasible previously impossible FL deployments on commodity edge devices. Our source code is available at https://github.com/Astuary/Spry.</description>

Abstract: Imitation learning aims to learn a policy from observing expert demonstrations without access to reward signals from environments. Generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) formulates imitation learning as adversarial learning, employing a generator policy learning to imitate expert behaviors and discriminator learning to distinguish the expert demonstrations from agent trajectories. Despite its encouraging results, GAIL training is often brittle and unstable. Inspired by the recent dominance of diffusion models in generative modeling, we propose Diffusion-Reward Adversarial Imitation Learning (DRAIL), which integrates a diffusion model into GAIL, aiming to yield more robust and smoother rewards for policy learning. Specifically, we propose a diffusion discriminative classifier to construct an enhanced discriminator, and design diffusion rewards based on the classifier's output for policy learning. Extensive experiments are conducted in navigation, manipulation, and locomotion, verifying DRAIL's effectiveness compared to prior imitation learning methods. Moreover, additional experimental results demonstrate the generalizability and data efficiency of DRAIL. Visualized learned reward functions of GAIL and DRAIL suggest that DRAIL can produce more robust and smoother rewards. Project page: https://nturobotlearninglab.github.io/DRAIL/</description>

      <title>Exploring Edge Probability Graph Models Beyond Edge Independency: Concepts, Analyses, and Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Desirable random graph models (RGMs) should (i) generate realistic structures such as high clustering (i.e., high subgraph densities), (ii) generate variable (i.e., not overly similar) graphs, and (iii) remain tractable to compute and control graph statistics. A common class of RGMs (e.g., Erd\H{o}s-R'{e}nyi and stochastic Kronecker) outputs edge probabilities, and we need to realize (i.e., sample from) the edge probabilities to generate graphs. Typically, each edge's existence is assumed to be determined independently for simplicity and tractability. However, with edge independency, RGMs theoretically cannot produce high subgraph densities and high output variability simultaneously. In this work, we explore realization beyond edge independence that can produce more realistic structures while maintaining high traceability and variability. Theoretically, we propose an edge-dependent realization framework called binding that provably preserves output variability, and derive closed-form tractability results on subgraph (e.g., triangle) densities in generated graphs. Practically, we propose algorithms for graph generation with binding and parameter fitting of binding. Our empirical results demonstrate that binding exhibits high tractability and generates realistic graphs with high clustering, significantly improving upon existing RGMs assuming edge independency.</description>

      <title>Understanding Linear Probing then Fine-tuning Language Models from NTK Perspective</title>

Abstract: The two-stage fine-tuning (FT) method, linear probing (LP) then fine-tuning (LP-FT), outperforms linear probing and FT alone. This holds true for both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. One key reason for its success is the preservation of pre-trained features, achieved by obtaining a near-optimal linear head during LP. However, despite the widespread use of large language models, there has been limited exploration of more complex architectures such as Transformers. In this paper, we analyze the training dynamics of LP-FT for classification tasks on the basis of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory. Our analysis decomposes the NTK matrix into two components. This decomposition highlights the importance of the linear head norm alongside the prediction accuracy at the start of the FT stage. We also observe a significant increase in the linear head norm during LP, which stems from training with the cross-entropy (CE) loss. This increase in the linear head norm effectively reduces changes in learned features. Furthermore, we find that this increased norm can adversely affect model calibration, which can be corrected using temperature scaling. Additionally, we extend our analysis with the NTK to the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method and validate its effectiveness. Our experiments using a Transformer-based model on multiple natural language processing datasets confirm our theoretical analysis. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of LP-FT for fine-tuning language models. Code is available at https://github.com/tom4649/lp-ft_ntk.</description>

      <title>Crowdsourcing with Difficulty: A Bayesian Rating Model for Heterogeneous Items</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In applied statistics and machine learning, the "gold standards" used for training are often biased and almost always noisy. Dawid and Skene's justifiably popular crowdsourcing model adjusts for rater (coder, annotator) sensitivity and specificity, but fails to capture distributional properties of rating data gathered for training, which in turn biases training. In this study, we introduce a general purpose measurement-error model with which we can infer consensus categories by adding item-level effects for difficulty, discriminativeness, and guessability. We further show how to constrain the bimodal posterior of these models to avoid (or if necessary, allow) adversarial raters. We validate our model's goodness of fit with posterior predictive checks, the Bayesian analogue of $\chi^2$ tests. Dawid and Skene's model is rejected by goodness of fit tests, whereas our new model, which adjusts for item heterogeneity, is not rejected. We illustrate our new model with two well-studied data sets, binary rating data for caries in dental X-rays and implication in natural language.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Navigation Context into Inland Vessel Trajectory Prediction: A Gaussian Mixture Model and Transformer Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using data sources beyond the Automatic Identification System to represent the context a vessel is navigating in and consequently improve situation awareness is still rare in machine learning approaches to vessel trajectory prediction (VTP). In inland shipping, where vessel movement is constrained within fairways, navigational context information is indispensable. In this contribution targeting inland VTP, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are applied, on a fused dataset of AIS and discharge measurements, to generate multi-modal distribution curves, capturing typical lateral vessel positioning in the fairway and dislocation speeds along the waterway. By sampling the probability density curves of the GMMs, feature vectors are derived which are used, together with spatio-temporal vessel features and fairway geometries, as input to a VTP transformer model. The incorporation of these distribution features of both the current and forthcoming navigation context improves prediction accuracy. The superiority of the model over a previously proposed transformer model for inland VTP is shown. The novelty lies in the provision of preprocessed, statistics-based features representing the conditioned spatial context, rather than relying on the model to extract relevant features for the VTP task from contextual data. Oversimplification of the complexity of inland navigation patterns by assuming a single typical route or selecting specific clusters prior to model application is avoided by giving the model access to the entire distribution information. The methodology's generalizability is demonstrated through the usage of data of 3 distinct river sections. It can be integrated into an interaction-aware prediction framework, where insights into the positioning of the actual vessel behavior in the overall distribution at the current location and discharge can enhance trajectory prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Temporal Graph Rewiring with Expander Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolving relations in real-world networks are often modelled by temporal graphs. Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) emerged to model evolutionary behaviour of such graphs by leveraging the message passing primitive at the core of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It is well-known that GNNs are vulnerable to several issues directly related to the input graph topology, such as under-reaching and over-squashing - we argue that these issues can often get exacerbated in temporal graphs, particularly as the result of stale nodes and edges. While graph rewiring techniques have seen frequent usage in GNNs to make the graph topology more favourable for message passing, they have not seen any mainstream usage on TGNNs. In this work, we propose Temporal Graph Rewiring (TGR), the first approach for graph rewiring on temporal graphs, to the best of our knowledge. TGR constructs message passing highways between temporally distant nodes in a continuous-time dynamic graph by utilizing expander graph propagation, a prominent framework used for graph rewiring on static graphs which makes minimal assumptions on the underlying graph structure. On the challenging TGB benchmark, TGR achieves state-of-the-art results on tgbl-review, tgbl-coin, tgbl-comment and tgbl-flight datasets at the time of writing. For tgbl-review, TGR has 50.5% improvement in MRR over the base TGN model and 22.2% improvement over the base TNCN model. The significant improvement over base models demonstrates clear benefits of temporal graph rewiring.</description>

      <title>Treeffuser: Probabilistic Predictions via Conditional Diffusions with Gradient-Boosted Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probabilistic prediction aims to compute predictive distributions rather than single point predictions. These distributions enable practitioners to quantify uncertainty, compute risk, and detect outliers. However, most probabilistic methods assume parametric responses, such as Gaussian or Poisson distributions. When these assumptions fail, such models lead to bad predictions and poorly calibrated uncertainty. In this paper, we propose Treeffuser, an easy-to-use method for probabilistic prediction on tabular data. The idea is to learn a conditional diffusion model where the score function is estimated using gradient-boosted trees. The conditional diffusion model makes Treeffuser flexible and non-parametric, while the gradient-boosted trees make it robust and easy to train on CPUs. Treeffuser learns well-calibrated predictive distributions and can handle a wide range of regression tasks -- including those with multivariate, multimodal, and skewed responses. We study Treeffuser on synthetic and real data and show that it outperforms existing methods, providing better calibrated probabilistic predictions. We further demonstrate its versatility with an application to inventory allocation under uncertainty using sales data from Walmart. We implement Treeffuser in https://github.com/blei-lab/treeffuser.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contextual bandit algorithms are essential for solving real-world decision making problems. In practice, collecting a contextual bandit's feedback from different domains may involve different costs. For example, measuring drug reaction from mice (as a source domain) and humans (as a target domain). Unfortunately, adapting a contextual bandit algorithm from a source domain to a target domain with distribution shift still remains a major challenge and largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce the first general domain adaptation method for contextual bandits. Our approach learns a bandit model for the target domain by collecting feedback from the source domain. Our theoretical analysis shows that our algorithm maintains a sub-linear regret bound even adapting across domains. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art contextual bandit algorithms on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Slicing Through Bias: Explaining Performance Gaps in Medical Image Analysis using Slice Discovery Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning models have achieved high overall accuracy in medical image analysis. However, performance disparities on specific patient groups pose challenges to their clinical utility, safety, and fairness. This can affect known patient groups - such as those based on sex, age, or disease subtype - as well as previously unknown and unlabeled groups. Furthermore, the root cause of such observed performance disparities is often challenging to uncover, hindering mitigation efforts. In this paper, to address these issues, we leverage Slice Discovery Methods (SDMs) to identify interpretable underperforming subsets of data and formulate hypotheses regarding the cause of observed performance disparities. We introduce a novel SDM and apply it in a case study on the classification of pneumothorax and atelectasis from chest x-rays. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of SDMs in hypothesis formulation and yields an explanation of previously observed but unexplained performance disparities between male and female patients in widely used chest X-ray datasets and models. Our findings indicate shortcut learning in both classification tasks, through the presence of chest drains and ECG wires, respectively. Sex-based differences in the prevalence of these shortcut features appear to cause the observed classification performance gap, representing a previously underappreciated interaction between shortcut learning and model fairness analyses.</description>

      <title>BPO: Staying Close to the Behavior LLM Creates Better Online LLM Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12168v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct alignment from preferences (DAP) has emerged as a promising paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) to human desiderata from pre-collected, offline preference datasets. While recent studies indicate that existing offline DAP methods can directly benefit from online training samples, we highlight the need to develop specific online DAP algorithms to fully harness the power of online training. Specifically, we identify that the learned LLM should adhere to the proximity of the behavior LLM, which collects the training samples. To this end, we propose online Preference Optimization in proximity to the Behavior LLM (BPO), emphasizing the importance of constructing a proper trust region for LLM alignment.
  We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness and applicability of our approach by integrating it with various DAP methods, resulting in significant performance improvements across a wide range of tasks when training with the same amount of preference data. Even when only introducing one additional data collection phase, our online BPO improves its offline DAP baseline from 72.0% to 80.2% on TL;DR and from 82.2% to 89.1% on Anthropic Helpfulness in terms of win rate against human reference text.</description>

      <title>Pessimistic asynchronous sampling in high-cost Bayesian optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asynchronous Bayesian optimization is a recently implemented technique that allows for parallel operation of experimental systems and disjointed workflows. Contrasting with serial Bayesian optimization which individually selects experiments one at a time after conducting a measurement for each experiment, asynchronous policies sequentially assign multiple experiments before measurements can be taken and evaluate new measurements continuously as they are made available. This technique allows for faster data generation and therefore faster optimization of an experimental space. This work extends the capabilities of asynchronous optimization methods beyond prior studies by evaluating four additional policies that incorporate pessimistic predictions in the training data set. Combined with a conventional policy that uses model predictions, the five total policies were evaluated in a simulated environment and benchmarked with serial sampling. Under some conditions and parameter space dimensionalities, the pessimistic prediction asynchronous policy reached optimum experimental conditions in significantly fewer experiments than equivalent serial policies and proved to be less susceptible to convergence onto local optima at higher dimensions. Without accounting for the faster sampling rate, the pessimistic asynchronous algorithm presented in this work could result in more efficient algorithm driven optimization of high-cost experimental spaces. Accounting for sampling rate, the presented asynchronous algorithm could allow for faster optimization in experimental spaces where multiple experiments can be run before results are collected.</description>

      <title>GLBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Graph with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the way we interact with graphs, leading to a new paradigm called GraphLLM. Despite the rapid development of GraphLLM methods in recent years, the progress and understanding of this field remain unclear due to the lack of a benchmark with consistent experimental protocols. To bridge this gap, we introduce GLBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GraphLLM methods in both supervised and zero-shot scenarios. GLBench provides a fair and thorough evaluation of different categories of GraphLLM methods, along with traditional baselines such as graph neural networks. Through extensive experiments on a collection of real-world datasets with consistent data processing and splitting strategies, we have uncovered several key findings. Firstly, GraphLLM methods outperform traditional baselines in supervised settings, with LLM-as-enhancers showing the most robust performance. However, using LLMs as predictors is less effective and often leads to uncontrollable output issues. We also notice that no clear scaling laws exist for current GraphLLM methods. In addition, both structures and semantics are crucial for effective zero-shot transfer, and our proposed simple baseline can even outperform several models tailored for zero-shot scenarios. The data and code of the benchmark can be found at https://github.com/NineAbyss/GLBench.</description>

Abstract: This work analyzes average-reward reinforcement learning with general parametrization. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) guarantees for this problem are either suboptimal or demand prior knowledge of the mixing time of the underlying Markov process, which is unavailable in most practical scenarios. We introduce a Multi-level Monte Carlo-based Natural Actor-Critic (MLMC-NAC) algorithm to address these issues. Our approach is the first to achieve a global convergence rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{T})$ without needing the knowledge of mixing time. It significantly surpasses the SOTA bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$ where $T$ is the horizon length.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new approach to processing complex-valued data using DNNs consisting of parallel real-valued subnetworks with coupled outputs. Our proposed class of architectures, referred to as Steinmetz Neural Networks, leverages multi-view learning to construct more interpretable representations within the latent space. Moreover, we present the Analytic Neural Network, which incorporates a consistency penalty that encourages analytic signal representations in the latent space of the Steinmetz neural network. This penalty enforces a deterministic and orthogonal relationship between the real and imaginary components. Utilizing an information-theoretic construction, we demonstrate that the generalization error upper bound posited by the analytic neural network is lower than that of the general class of Steinmetz neural networks. Our numerical experiments depict the improved performance and robustness to additive noise, afforded by these networks on benchmark datasets and synthetic examples.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Message Passing for Glycan Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glycans are the most complex biological sequence, with monosaccharides forming extended, non-linear sequences. As post-translational modifications, they modulate protein structure, function, and interactions. Due to their diversity and complexity, predictive models of glycan properties and functions are still insufficient. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are deep learning models designed to process and analyze graph-structured data. These architectures leverage the connectivity and relational information in graphs to learn effective representations of nodes, edges, and entire graphs. Iteratively aggregating information from neighboring nodes, GNNs capture complex patterns within graph data, making them particularly well-suited for tasks such as link prediction or graph classification across domains. This work presents a new model architecture based on combinatorial complexes and higher-order message passing to extract features from glycan structures into a latent space representation. The architecture is evaluated on an improved GlycanML benchmark suite, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance. We envision that these improvements will spur further advances in computational glycosciences and reveal the roles of glycans in biology.</description>

      <title>A Historical Trajectory Assisted Optimization Method for Zeroth-Order Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15955v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning heavily relies on distributed gradient descent techniques. In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. The proposed method uses a covariance matrix for sampling which is a convex combination of two parts. The first part is a thin projection matrix containing the basis of the subspace which is designed to improve the exploitation ability. The second part is the historical trajectories. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Merging LoRAs like Playing LEGO: Pushing the Modularity of LoRA to Extremes Through Rank-Wise Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a popular technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to various domains due to its modular design and widespread availability on platforms like Huggingface. This modularity has sparked interest in combining multiple LoRAs to enhance LLM capabilities. However, existing methods for LoRA composition primarily focus on task-specific adaptations that require additional training, and current model merging techniques often fail to fully leverage LoRA's modular nature, leading to parameter interference and performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of disassembling and reassembling multiple LoRAs at a finer granularity, analogous to assembling LEGO blocks. We introduce the concept of Minimal Semantic Units (MSUs), where the parameters corresponding to each rank in LoRA function as independent units. These MSUs demonstrate permutation invariance and concatenation-summation equivalence properties, enabling flexible combinations to create new LoRAs. Building on these insights, we propose the LoRA-LEGO framework. This framework conducts rank-wise parameter clustering by grouping MSUs from different LoRAs into $k$ clusters. The centroid of each cluster serves as a representative MSU, enabling the assembly of a merged LoRA with an adjusted rank of $k$. Additionally, we apply a dual reweighting strategy to optimize the scale of the merged LoRA. Experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in LoRA merging.</description>

      <title>ABCFair: an Adaptable Benchmark approach for Comparing Fairness Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous methods have been implemented that pursue fairness with respect to sensitive features by mitigating biases in machine learning. Yet, the problem settings that each method tackles vary significantly, including the stage of intervention, the composition of sensitive features, the fairness notion, and the distribution of the output. Even in binary classification, these subtle differences make it highly complicated to benchmark fairness methods, as their performance can strongly depend on exactly how the bias mitigation problem was originally framed.
  Hence, we introduce ABCFair, a benchmark approach which allows adapting to the desiderata of the real-world problem setting, enabling proper comparability between methods for any use case. We apply ABCFair to a range of pre-, in-, and postprocessing methods on both large-scale, traditional datasets and on a dual label (biased and unbiased) dataset to sidestep the fairness-accuracy trade-off.</description>

      <title>Sample Compression Unleashed: New Generalization Bounds for Real Valued Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sample compression theory provides generalization guarantees for predictors that can be fully defined using a subset of the training dataset and a (short) message string, generally defined as a binary sequence. Previous works provided generalization bounds for the zero-one loss, which is restrictive notably when applied to deep learning approaches. In this paper, we present a general framework for deriving new sample compression bounds that hold for real-valued unbounded losses. Using the Pick-To-Learn (P2L) meta-algorithm, which transforms the training method of any machine-learning predictor to yield sample-compressed predictors, we empirically demonstrate the tightness of the bounds and their versatility by evaluating them on random forests and multiple types of neural networks.</description>

      <title>Boosting Sample Efficiency and Generalization in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning via Equivariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) struggles with sample inefficiency and poor generalization [1]. These challenges are partially due to a lack of structure or inductive bias in the neural networks typically used in learning the policy. One such form of structure that is commonly observed in multi-agent scenarios is symmetry. The field of Geometric Deep Learning has developed Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNN) that are equivariant (or symmetric) to rotations, translations, and reflections of nodes. Incorporating equivariance has been shown to improve learning efficiency and decrease error [ 2 ]. In this paper, we demonstrate that EGNNs improve the sample efficiency and generalization in MARL. However, we also show that a naive application of EGNNs to MARL results in poor early exploration due to a bias in the EGNN structure. To mitigate this bias, we present Exploration-enhanced Equivariant Graph Neural Networks or E2GN2. We compare E2GN2 to other common function approximators using common MARL benchmarks MPE and SMACv2. E2GN2 demonstrates a significant improvement in sample efficiency, greater final reward convergence, and a 2x-5x gain in over standard GNNs in our generalization tests. These results pave the way for more reliable and effective solutions in complex multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable Simulation-free Entropic Unbalanced Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Optimal Transport (OT) problem investigates a transport map that connects two distributions while minimizing a given cost function. Finding such a transport map has diverse applications in machine learning, such as generative modeling and image-to-image translation. In this paper, we introduce a scalable and simulation-free approach for solving the Entropic Unbalanced Optimal Transport (EUOT) problem. We derive the dynamical form of this EUOT problem, which is a generalization of the Schr\"odinger bridges (SB) problem. Based on this, we derive dual formulation and optimality conditions of the EUOT problem from the stochastic optimal control interpretation. By leveraging these properties, we propose a simulation-free algorithm to solve EUOT, called Simulation-free EUOT (SF-EUOT). While existing SB models require expensive simulation costs during training and evaluation, our model achieves simulation-free training and one-step generation by utilizing the reciprocal property. Our model demonstrates significantly improved scalability in generative modeling and image-to-image translation tasks compared to previous SB methods.</description>

      <title>Improving Neural Optimal Transport via Displacement Interpolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) theory investigates the cost-minimizing transport map that moves a source distribution to a target distribution. Recently, several approaches have emerged for learning the optimal transport map for a given cost function using neural networks. We refer to these approaches as the OT Map. OT Map provides a powerful tool for diverse machine learning tasks, such as generative modeling and unpaired image-to-image translation. However, existing methods that utilize max-min optimization often experience training instability and sensitivity to hyperparameters. In this paper, we propose a novel method to improve stability and achieve a better approximation of the OT Map by exploiting displacement interpolation, dubbed Displacement Interpolation Optimal Transport Model (DIOTM). We derive the dual formulation of displacement interpolation at specific time $t$ and prove how these dual problems are related across time. This result allows us to utilize the entire trajectory of displacement interpolation in learning the OT Map. Our method improves the training stability and achieves superior results in estimating optimal transport maps. We demonstrate that DIOTM outperforms existing OT-based models on image-to-image translation tasks.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Assessment of Landscape Shifts Based on Persistent Entropy and Topological Preservation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Continual Learning (CL) contexts, concept drift typically refers to the analysis of changes in data distribution. A drift in the input data can have negative consequences on a learning predictor and the system's stability. The majority of concept drift methods emphasize the analysis of statistical changes in non-stationary data over time. In this context, we consider another perspective, where the concept drift also integrates substantial changes in the topological characteristics of the data stream. In this article, we introduce a novel framework for monitoring changes in multi-dimensional data streams. We explore variations in the topological structures of the data, presenting another angle on the standard concept drift. Our developed approach is based on persistent entropy and topology-preserving projections in a continual learning scenario. The framework operates in both unsupervised and supervised environments. To show the utility of the proposed framework, we analyze the model across three scenarios using data streams generated with MNIST samples. The obtained results reveal the potential of applying topological data analysis for shift detection and encourage further research in this area.</description>

      <title>Is the MMI Criterion Necessary for Interpretability? Degenerating Non-causal Features to Plain Noise for Self-Rationalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06003v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important line of research in the field of explainability is to extract a small subset of crucial rationales from the full input. The most widely used criterion for rationale extraction is the maximum mutual information (MMI) criterion. However, in certain datasets, there are spurious features non-causally correlated with the label and also get high mutual information, complicating the loss landscape of MMI. Although some penalty-based methods have been developed to penalize the spurious features (e.g., invariance penalty, intervention penalty, etc) to help MMI work better, these are merely remedial measures. In the optimization objectives of these methods, spurious features are still distinguished from plain noise, which hinders the discovery of causal rationales. This paper aims to develop a new criterion that treats spurious features as plain noise, allowing the model to work on datasets rich in spurious features as if it were working on clean datasets, thereby making rationale extraction easier. We theoretically observe that removing either plain noise or spurious features from the input does not alter the conditional distribution of the remaining components relative to the task label. However, significant changes in the conditional distribution occur only when causal features are eliminated. Based on this discovery, the paper proposes a criterion for \textbf{M}aximizing the \textbf{R}emaining \textbf{D}iscrepancy (MRD). Experiments on six widely used datasets show that our MRD criterion improves rationale quality (measured by the overlap with human-annotated rationales) by up to $10.4\%$ as compared to several recent competitive MMI variants.

      <title>Stochastic Sparse Sampling: A Framework for Variable-Length Medical Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the majority of time series classification research has focused on modeling fixed-length sequences, variable-length time series classification (VTSC) remains critical in healthcare, where sequence length may vary among patients and events. To address this challenge, we propose $\textbf{S}$tochastic $\textbf{S}$parse $\textbf{S}$ampling (SSS), a novel VTSC framework developed for medical time series. SSS manages variable-length sequences by sparsely sampling fixed windows to compute local predictions, which are then aggregated and calibrated to form a global prediction. We apply SSS to the task of seizure onset zone (SOZ) localization, a critical VTSC problem requiring identification of seizure-inducing brain regions from variable-length electrophysiological time series. We evaluate our method on the Epilepsy iEEG Multicenter Dataset, a heterogeneous collection of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings obtained from four independent medical centers. SSS demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across most medical centers, and superior performance on all out-of-distribution (OOD) unseen medical centers. Additionally, SSS naturally provides post-hoc insights into local signal characteristics related to the SOZ, by visualizing temporally averaged local predictions throughout the signal.</description>

      <title>Q-WSL: Optimizing Goal-Conditioned RL with Weighted Supervised Learning via Dynamic Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06648v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel class of advanced algorithms, termed Goal-Conditioned Weighted Supervised Learning (GCWSL), has recently emerged to tackle the challenges posed by sparse rewards in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL). GCWSL consistently delivers strong performance across a diverse set of goal-reaching tasks due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and stability. However, GCWSL methods lack a crucial capability known as trajectory stitching, which is essential for learning optimal policies when faced with unseen skills during testing. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced when the replay buffer is predominantly filled with sub-optimal trajectories. In contrast, traditional TD-based RL methods, such as Q-learning, which utilize Dynamic Programming, do not face this issue but often experience instability due to the inherent difficulties in value function approximation. In this paper, we propose Q-learning Weighted Supervised Learning (Q-WSL), a novel framework designed to overcome the limitations of GCWSL by incorporating the strengths of Dynamic Programming found in Q-learning. Q-WSL leverages Dynamic Programming results to output the optimal action of (state, goal) pairs across different trajectories within the replay buffer. This approach synergizes the strengths of both Q-learning and GCWSL, effectively mitigating their respective weaknesses and enhancing overall performance. Empirical evaluations on challenging goal-reaching tasks demonstrate that Q-WSL surpasses other goal-conditioned approaches in terms of both performance and sample efficiency. Additionally, Q-WSL exhibits notable robustness in environments characterized by binary reward structures and environmental stochasticity.</description>

      <title>On Divergence Measures for Training GFlowNets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are amortized inference models designed to sample from unnormalized distributions over composable objects, with applications in generative modeling for tasks in fields such as causal discovery, NLP, and drug discovery. Traditionally, the training procedure for GFlowNets seeks to minimize the expected log-squared difference between a proposal (forward policy) and a target (backward policy) distribution, which enforces certain flow-matching conditions. While this training procedure is closely related to variational inference (VI), directly attempting standard Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization can lead to proven biased and potentially high-variance estimators. Therefore, we first review four divergence measures, namely, Renyi-$\alpha$'s, Tsallis-$\alpha$'s, reverse and forward KL's, and design statistically efficient estimators for their stochastic gradients in the context of training GFlowNets. Then, we verify that properly minimizing these divergences yields a provably correct and empirically effective training scheme, often leading to significantly faster convergence than previously proposed optimization. To achieve this, we design control variates based on the REINFORCE leave-one-out and score-matching estimators to reduce the variance of the learning objectives' gradients. Our work contributes by narrowing the gap between GFlowNets training and generalized variational approximations, paving the way for algorithmic ideas informed by the divergence minimization viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Context-Parametric Inversion: Why Instruction Finetuning May Not Actually Improve Context Reliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A standard practice when using large language models is for users to supplement their instruction with an input context containing new information for the model to process. However, models struggle to reliably follow the input context, especially when it conflicts with their parametric knowledge from pretraining. In-principle, one would expect models to adapt to the user context better after instruction finetuning, particularly when handling knowledge conflicts. However, we observe a surprising failure mode: during instruction tuning, the context reliance under knowledge conflicts initially increases as expected, but then gradually decreases as instruction finetuning progresses. This happens while the performance on standard benchmarks keeps on increasing far after this drop. We call this phenomenon context-parametric inversion and observe it across multiple general purpose instruction tuning datasets such as TULU, Alpaca and Ultrachat, across different model families like Llama, Mistral, and Pythia. We perform various controlled studies and theoretical analysis to show that context-parametric inversion occurs due to examples in the instruction finetuning data where the input context provides information that aligns with model's parametric knowledge. Our analysis suggests some natural mitigation strategies with limited but insightful gains, and serves as a useful starting point in addressing this deficiency in instruction finetuning.</description>

      <title>Advancing Training Efficiency of Deep Spiking Neural Networks through Rate-based Backpropagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent insights have revealed that rate-coding is a primary form of information representation captured by surrogate-gradient-based Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) in training deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Motivated by these findings, we propose rate-based backpropagation, a training strategy specifically designed to exploit rate-based representations to reduce the complexity of BPTT. Our method minimizes reliance on detailed temporal derivatives by focusing on averaged dynamics, streamlining the computational graph to reduce memory and computational demands of SNNs training. We substantiate the rationality of the gradient approximation between BPTT and the proposed method through both theoretical analysis and empirical observations. Comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR10-DVS validate that our method achieves comparable performance to BPTT counterparts, and surpasses state-of-the-art efficient training techniques. By leveraging the inherent benefits of rate-coding, this work sets the stage for more scalable and efficient SNNs training within resource-constrained environments. Our code is available at https://github.com/Tab-ct/rate-based-backpropagation.</description>

      <title>The Persian Rug: solving toy models of superposition using large-scale symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a complete mechanistic description of the algorithm learned by a minimal non-linear sparse data autoencoder in the limit of large input dimension. The model, originally presented in arXiv:2209.10652, compresses sparse data vectors through a linear layer and decompresses using another linear layer followed by a ReLU activation. We notice that when the data is permutation symmetric (no input feature is privileged) large models reliably learn an algorithm that is sensitive to individual weights only through their large-scale statistics. For these models, the loss function becomes analytically tractable. Using this understanding, we give the explicit scalings of the loss at high sparsity, and show that the model is near-optimal among recently proposed architectures. In particular, changing or adding to the activation function any elementwise or filtering operation can at best improve the model's performance by a constant factor. Finally, we forward-engineer a model with the requisite symmetries and show that its loss precisely matches that of the trained models. Unlike the trained model weights, the low randomness in the artificial weights results in miraculous fractal structures resembling a Persian rug, to which the algorithm is oblivious. Our work contributes to neural network interpretability by introducing techniques for understanding the structure of autoencoders. Code to reproduce our results can be found at https://github.com/KfirD/PersianRug .</description>

      <title>From PINNs to PIKANs: Recent Advances in Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a key tool in Scientific Machine Learning since their introduction in 2017, enabling the efficient solution of ordinary and partial differential equations using sparse measurements. Over the past few years, significant advancements have been made in the training and optimization of PINNs, covering aspects such as network architectures, adaptive refinement, domain decomposition, and the use of adaptive weights and activation functions. A notable recent development is the Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANS), which leverage a representation model originally proposed by Kolmogorov in 1957, offering a promising alternative to traditional PINNs. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in PINNs, focusing on improvements in network design, feature expansion, optimization techniques, uncertainty quantification, and theoretical insights. We also survey key applications across a range of fields, including biomedicine, fluid and solid mechanics, geophysics, dynamical systems, heat transfer, chemical engineering, and beyond. Finally, we review computational frameworks and software tools developed by both academia and industry to support PINN research and applications.</description>

Abstract: Time series forecasting is vital in numerous web applications, influencing critical decision-making across industries. While diffusion models have recently gained increasing popularity for this task, we argue they suffer from a significant drawback: indiscriminate noise addition to the original time series followed by denoising, which can obscure underlying dynamic evolving trend and complicate forecasting. To address this limitation, we propose a novel flexible decoupled framework (FDF) that learns high-quality time series representations for enhanced forecasting performance. A key characteristic of our approach leverages the inherent inductive bias of time series data by decomposing it into trend and seasonal components, each modeled separately to enable decoupled analysis and modeling. Specifically, we propose an innovative Conditional Denoising Seasonal Module (CDSM) within the diffusion model, which leverages statistical information from the historical window to conditionally model the complex seasonal component. Notably, we incorporate a Polynomial Trend Module (PTM) to effectively capture the smooth trend component, thereby enhancing the model's ability to represent temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and higlighting its flexibility in time series forecasting. We hope our work can bring a new perspective for time series forecasting. We intend to make our code publicly available as open-source in the future.</description>

      <title>Data-driven rainfall prediction at a regional scale: a case study with Ghana</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With a warming planet, tropical regions are expected to experience the brunt of climate change, with more intense and more volatile rainfall events. Currently, state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are known to struggle to produce skillful rainfall forecasts in tropical regions of Africa. There is thus a pressing need for improved rainfall forecasting in these regions. Over the last decade or so, the increased availability of large-scale meteorological datasets and the development of powerful machine learning models have opened up new opportunities for data-driven weather forecasting. Focusing on Ghana in this study, we use these tools to develop two U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) models, to predict 24h rainfall at 12h and 30h lead-time. The models were trained using data from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, and the GPM-IMERG dataset. A special attention was paid to interpretability. We developed a novel statistical methodology that allowed us to probe the relative importance of the meteorological variables input in our model, offering useful insights into the factors that drive precipitation in the Ghana region. Empirically, we found that our 12h lead-time model has performances that match, and in some accounts are better than the 18h lead-time forecasts produced by the ECMWF (as available in the TIGGE dataset). We also found that combining our data-driven model with classical NWP further improves forecast accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Framework for Clustered Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main challenges of federated learning (FL) is handling non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) client data, which may occur in practice due to unbalanced datasets and use of different data sources across clients. Knowledge sharing and model personalization are key strategies for addressing this issue. Clustered federated learning is a class of FL methods that groups clients that observe similarly distributed data into clusters, such that every client is typically associated with one data distribution and participates in training a model for that distribution along their cluster peers. In this paper, we present a unified Bayesian framework for clustered FL which associates clients to clusters. Then we propose several practical algorithms to handle the, otherwise growing, data associations in a way that trades off performance and computational complexity. This work provides insights on client-cluster associations and enables client knowledge sharing in new ways. The proposed framework circumvents the need for unique client-cluster associations, which is seen to increase the performance of the resulting models in a variety of experiments.</description>

      <title>Mesa-Extrapolation: A Weave Position Encoding Method for Enhanced Extrapolation in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), although having revolutionized many fields, still suffer from the challenging extrapolation problem, where the inference ability of LLMs sharply declines beyond their max training lengths. In this work, we conduct a theoretical analysis to better understand why No Position Encoding (NoPE) fails outside its effective range, as well as examining the power of Position Encoding (PE) in this context. Our findings reveal that with meticulous weave position, PE can indeed be extended beyond effective range. Our theorems establish that LLMs equipped with weave PE can achieve improved extrapolation performance without additional cost. Furthermore, we introduce a novel weave PE method, Mesa-Extrapolation, which utilizes a chunk-based triangular attention matrix and applies Stair PE to manage the final chunk. This method not only retains competitive performance but also offers substantial benefits such as significantly reduced memory demand and faster inference speed. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Mesa-Extrapolation, demonstrating its potential as a scalable solution to enhancing LLMs applicative reach.</description>

      <title>Diverse Policies Recovering via Pointwise Mutual Information Weighted Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recovering a spectrum of diverse policies from a set of expert trajectories is an important research topic in imitation learning. After determining a latent style for a trajectory, previous diverse policies recovering methods usually employ a vanilla behavioral cloning learning objective conditioned on the latent style, treating each state-action pair in the trajectory with equal importance. Based on an observation that in many scenarios, behavioral styles are often highly relevant with only a subset of state-action pairs, this paper presents a new principled method in diverse polices recovery. In particular, after inferring or assigning a latent style for a trajectory, we enhance the vanilla behavioral cloning by incorporating a weighting mechanism based on pointwise mutual information. This additional weighting reflects the significance of each state-action pair's contribution to learning the style, thus allowing our method to focus on state-action pairs most representative of that style. We provide theoretical justifications for our new objective, and extensive empirical evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our method in recovering diverse policies from expert data.</description>

      <title>CartesianMoE: Boosting Knowledge Sharing among Experts via Cartesian Product Routing in Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have been attracting much attention from the community recently, due to their remarkable performance in all kinds of downstream tasks. According to the well-known scaling law, scaling up a dense LLM enhances its capabilities, but also significantly increases the computational complexity. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models address that by allowing the model size to grow without substantially raising training or inference costs. Yet MoE models face challenges regarding knowledge sharing among experts, making their performance somehow sensitive to routing accuracy. To tackle that, previous works introduced shared experts and combined their outputs with those of the top $K$ routed experts in an ``addition'' manner. In this paper, inspired by collective matrix factorization to learn shared knowledge among data, we propose CartesianMoE, which implements more effective knowledge sharing among experts in more like a ``multiplication'' manner. Extensive experimental results indicate that CartesianMoE outperforms previous MoE models for building LLMs, in terms of both perplexity and downstream task performance. And we also find that CartesianMoE achieves better expert routing robustness.</description>

      <title>ExDBN: Exact learning of Dynamic Bayesian Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal learning from data has received much attention in recent years. One way of capturing causal relationships is by utilizing Bayesian networks. There, one recovers a weighted directed acyclic graph, in which random variables are represented by vertices, and the weights associated with each edge represent the strengths of the causal relationships between them. This concept is extended to capture dynamic effects by introducing a dependency on past data, which may be captured by the structural equation model, which is utilized in the present contribution to formulate a score-based learning approach. A mixed-integer quadratic program is formulated and an algorithmic solution proposed, in which the pre-generation of exponentially many acyclicity constraints is avoided by utilizing the so-called branch-and-cut ("lazy constraint") method. Comparing the novel approach to the state of the art, we show that the proposed approach turns out to produce excellent results when applied to small and medium-sized synthetic instances of up to 25 time-series. Lastly, two interesting applications in bio-science and finance, to which the method is directly applied, further stress the opportunities in developing highly accurate, globally convergent solvers that can handle modest instances.</description>

      <title>TensorProjection Layer: A Tensor-Based Dimension Reduction Method in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.04454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a dimension reduction method specifically designed for tensor-structured feature data in deep neural networks. The method is implemented as a hidden layer, called the TensorProjection layer, which transforms input tensors into output tensors with reduced dimensions through mode-wise projections. The projection directions are treated as model parameters of the layer and are optimized during model training. Our method can serve as an alternative to pooling layers for summarizing image data, or to convolutional layers as a technique for reducing the number of channels. We conduct experiments on tasks such as medical image classification and segmentation, integrating the TensorProjection layer into commonly used baseline architectures to evaluate its effectiveness. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed method can outperform traditional downsampling methods, such as pooling layers, in our tasks, suggesting it as a promising alternative for feature summarization.</description>

      <title>Beyond Trading Data: The Hidden Influence of Public Awareness and Interest on Cryptocurrency Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since Bitcoin first appeared on the scene in 2009, cryptocurrencies have become a worldwide phenomenon as important decentralized financial assets. Their decentralized nature, however, leads to notable volatility against traditional fiat currencies, making the task of accurately forecasting the crypto-fiat exchange rate complex. This study examines the various independent factors that affect the volatility of the Bitcoin-Dollar exchange rate. To this end, we propose CoMForE, a multimodal AdaBoost-LSTM ensemble model, which not only utilizes historical trading data but also incorporates public sentiments from related tweets, public interest demonstrated by search volumes, and blockchain hash-rate data. Our developed model goes a step further by predicting fluctuations in the overall cryptocurrency value distribution, thus increasing its value for investment decision-making. We have subjected this method to extensive testing via comprehensive experiments, thereby validating the importance of multimodal combination over exclusive reliance on trading data. Further experiments show that our method significantly surpasses existing forecasting tools and methodologies, demonstrating a 19.29% improvement. This result underscores the influence of external independent factors on cryptocurrency volatility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12835v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maximum mean discrepancies (MMDs) like the kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD) have grown central to a wide range of applications, including hypothesis testing, sampler selection, distribution approximation, and variational inference. In each setting, these kernel-based discrepancy measures are required to (i) separate a target P from other probability measures or even (ii) control weak convergence to P. In this article we derive new sufficient and necessary conditions to ensure (i) and (ii). For MMDs on separable metric spaces, we characterize those kernels that separate Bochner embeddable measures and introduce simple conditions for separating all measures with unbounded kernels and for controlling convergence with bounded kernels. We use these results on $\mathbb{R}^d$ to substantially broaden the known conditions for KSD separation and convergence control and to develop the first KSDs known to exactly metrize weak convergence to P. Along the way, we highlight the implications of our results for hypothesis testing, measuring and improving sample quality, and sampling with Stein variational gradient descent.</description>

      <title>On the Power of Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16327v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With infinitely many high-quality data points, infinite computational power, an infinitely large foundation model with a perfect training algorithm and guaranteed zero generalization error on the pretext task, can the model be used for everything? This question cannot be answered by the existing theory of representation, optimization or generalization, because the issues they mainly investigate are assumed to be nonexistent here. In this paper, we show that category theory provides powerful machinery to answer this question. We have proved three results. The first one limits the power of prompt-based learning, saying that the model can solve a downstream task with prompts if and only if the task is representable. The second one says fine tuning does not have this limit, as a foundation model with the minimum required power (up to symmetry) can theoretically solve downstream tasks for the category defined by pretext task, with fine tuning and enough resources. Our final result can be seen as a new type of generalization theorem, showing that the foundation model can generate unseen objects from the target category (e.g., images) using the structural information from the source category (e.g., texts). Along the way, we provide a categorical framework for supervised and self-supervised learning, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Complex Queries on Knowledge Graphs with Neural Link Predictors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07063v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reasoning on knowledge graphs is a challenging task because it utilizes observed information to predict the missing one. Particularly, answering complex queries based on first-order logic is one of the crucial tasks to verify learning to reason abilities for generalization and composition. Recently, the prevailing method is query embedding which learns the embedding of a set of entities and treats logic operations as set operations and has shown great empirical success. Though there has been much research following the same formulation, many of its claims lack a formal and systematic inspection. In this paper, we rethink this formulation and justify many of the previous claims by characterizing the scope of queries investigated previously and precisely identifying the gap between its formulation and its goal, as well as providing complexity analysis for the currently investigated queries. Moreover, we develop a new dataset containing ten new types of queries with features that have never been considered and therefore can provide a thorough investigation of complex queries. Finally, we propose a new neural-symbolic method, Fuzzy Inference with Truth value (FIT), where we equip the neural link predictors with fuzzy logic theory to support end-to-end learning using complex queries with provable reasoning capability. Empirical results show that our method outperforms previous methods significantly in the new dataset and also surpasses previous methods in the existing dataset at the same time.</description>

      <title>Explaining Provenance-Based GNN Detectors with Graph Structural Features</title>

Abstract: The opaqueness of ML-based security models hinders their broad adoption and consequently restricts transparent security operations due to their limited verifiability and explainability. To enhance the explainability of ML-based security models, we introduce PROVEXPLAINER, a framework offering security-aware explanations by translating an ML model's decision boundary onto the interpretable feature space of a surrogate DT. Our PROVEXPLAINER framework primarily focuses on explaining security models that are built using GNNs since recent studies employ GNNs to comprehensively digest system provenance graphs for security critical tasks. PROVEXPLAINER uses graph structural features based on security domain knowledge gained from extensive data analysis, utilizing public and private system provenance datasets.
  PROVEXPLAINER's interpretable feature space can be directly mapped to the system provenance problem space, making the explanations human understandable. Because the security landscape is constantly changing, PROVEXPLAINER can be easily extended with new explanatory features as they are identified in the wild. By considering prominent GNN architectures (e.g., GAT and GraphSAGE) for program classification and anomaly detection tasks, we show how PROVEXPLAINER synergizes with current SOTA GNN explainers to deliver domain-specific explanations. On malware and APT datasets, PROVEXPLAINER achieves up to 9.14% and 6.97% higher precision and recall, respectively, compared to SOTA GNN explainers. When combined with a general-purpose SOTA GNN explainer, PROVEXPLAINER shows a further improvement of 7.22% and 4.86% precision and recall over the best individual explainer.</description>

      <title>Online Tensor Learning: Computational and Statistical Trade-offs, Adaptivity and Optimal Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large tensor learning algorithms are typically computationally expensive and require storing a vast amount of data. In this paper, we propose a unified online Riemannian gradient descent (oRGrad) algorithm for tensor learning, which is computationally efficient, consumes much less memory, and can handle sequentially arriving data while making timely predictions. The algorithm is applicable to both linear and generalized linear models. If the time horizon T is known, oRGrad achieves statistical optimality by choosing an appropriate fixed step size. We find that noisy tensor completion particularly benefits from online algorithms by avoiding the trimming procedure and ensuring sharp entry-wise statistical error, which is often technically challenging for offline methods. The regret of oRGrad is analyzed, revealing a fascinating trilemma concerning the computational convergence rate, statistical error, and regret bound. By selecting an appropriate constant step size, oRGrad achieves an $O(T^{1/2})$ regret. We then introduce the adaptive-oRGrad algorithm, which can achieve the optimal $O(\log T)$ regret by adaptively selecting step sizes, regardless of whether the time horizon is known. The adaptive-oRGrad algorithm can attain a statistically optimal error rate without knowing the horizon. Comprehensive numerical simulations corroborate our theoretical findings. We show that oRGrad significantly outperforms its offline counterpart in predicting the solar F10.7 index with tensor predictors that monitor space weather impacts.</description>

Abstract: Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms have gained popularity due to their accessibility, cost-efficiency, scalability, and rapid development capabilities. However, recent research has highlighted the vulnerability of cloud-based models in MLaaS to model extraction attacks. In this paper, we introduce FDINET, a novel defense mechanism that leverages the feature distribution of deep neural network (DNN) models. Concretely, by analyzing the feature distribution from the adversary's queries, we reveal that the feature distribution of these queries deviates from that of the model's training set. Based on this key observation, we propose Feature Distortion Index (FDI), a metric designed to quantitatively measure the feature distribution deviation of received queries. The proposed FDINET utilizes FDI to train a binary detector and exploits FDI similarity to identify colluding adversaries from distributed extraction attacks. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate FDINET against six state-of-the-art extraction attacks on four benchmark datasets and four popular model architectures. Empirical results demonstrate the following findings FDINET proves to be highly effective in detecting model extraction, achieving a 100% detection accuracy on DFME and DaST. FDINET is highly efficient, using just 50 queries to raise an extraction alarm with an average confidence of 96.08% for GTSRB. FDINET exhibits the capability to identify colluding adversaries with an accuracy exceeding 91%. Additionally, it demonstrates the ability to detect two types of adaptive attacks.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Propagation over Conditional Independence Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conditional Independence (CI) graph is a special type of a Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) where the feature connections are modeled using an undirected graph and the edge weights show the partial correlation strength between the features. Since the CI graphs capture direct dependence between features, they have been garnering increasing interest within the research community for gaining insights into the systems from various domains, in particular discovering the domain topology. In this work, we propose algorithms for performing knowledge propagation over the CI graphs. Our experiments demonstrate that our techniques improve upon the state-of-the-art on the publicly available Cora and PubMed datasets.</description>

      <title>Soft ascent-descent as a stable and flexible alternative to flooding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a heuristic for improving test accuracy in classification, the "flooding" method proposed by Ishida et al. (2020) sets a threshold for the average surrogate loss at training time; above the threshold, gradient descent is run as usual, but below the threshold, a switch to gradient ascent is made. While setting the threshold is non-trivial and is usually done with validation data, this simple technique has proved remarkably effective in terms of accuracy. On the other hand, what if we are also interested in other metrics such as model complexity or average surrogate loss at test time? As an attempt to achieve better overall performance with less fine-tuning, we propose a softened, pointwise mechanism called SoftAD (soft ascent-descent) that downweights points on the borderline, limits the effects of outliers, and retains the ascent-descent effect of flooding, with no additional computational overhead. We contrast formal stationarity guarantees with those for flooding, and empirically demonstrate how SoftAD can realize classification accuracy competitive with flooding (and the more expensive alternative SAM) while enjoying a much smaller loss generalization gap and model norm.</description>

      <title>Community Detection Guarantees Using Embeddings Learned by Node2Vec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embedding the nodes of a large network into an Euclidean space is a common objective in modern machine learning, with a variety of tools available. These embeddings can then be used as features for tasks such as community detection/node clustering or link prediction, where they achieve state of the art performance. With the exception of spectral clustering methods, there is little theoretical understanding for commonly used approaches to learning embeddings. In this work we examine the theoretical properties of the embeddings learned by node2vec. Our main result shows that the use of $k$-means clustering on the embedding vectors produced by node2vec gives weakly consistent community recovery for the nodes in (degree corrected) stochastic block models. We also discuss the use of these embeddings for node and link prediction tasks. We demonstrate this result empirically, and examine how this relates to other embedding tools for network data.</description>

      <title>Scaling transformer neural networks for skillful and reliable medium-range weather forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weather forecasting is a fundamental problem for anticipating and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recently, data-driven approaches for weather forecasting based on deep learning have shown great promise, achieving accuracies that are competitive with operational systems. However, those methods often employ complex, customized architectures without sufficient ablation analysis, making it difficult to understand what truly contributes to their success. Here we introduce Stormer, a simple transformer model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on weather forecasting with minimal changes to the standard transformer backbone. We identify the key components of Stormer through careful empirical analyses, including weather-specific embedding, randomized dynamics forecast, and pressure-weighted loss. At the core of Stormer is a randomized forecasting objective that trains the model to forecast the weather dynamics over varying time intervals. During inference, this allows us to produce multiple forecasts for a target lead time and combine them to obtain better forecast accuracy. On WeatherBench 2, Stormer performs competitively at short to medium-range forecasts and outperforms current methods beyond 7 days, while requiring orders-of-magnitude less training data and compute. Additionally, we demonstrate Stormer's favorable scaling properties, showing consistent improvements in forecast accuracy with increases in model size and training tokens. Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/tung-nd/stormer.</description>

      <title>Learning to Denoise Biomedical Knowledge Graph for Robust Molecular Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular interaction prediction plays a crucial role in forecasting unknown interactions between molecules, such as drug-target interaction (DTI) and drug-drug interaction (DDI), which are essential in the field of drug discovery and therapeutics. Although previous prediction methods have yielded promising results by leveraging the rich semantics and topological structure of biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs), they have primarily focused on enhancing predictive performance without addressing the presence of inevitable noise and inconsistent semantics. This limitation has hindered the advancement of KG-based prediction methods. To address this limitation, we propose BioKDN (Biomedical Knowledge Graph Denoising Network) for robust molecular interaction prediction. BioKDN refines the reliable structure of local subgraphs by denoising noisy links in a learnable manner, providing a general module for extracting task-relevant interactions. To enhance the reliability of the refined structure, BioKDN maintains consistent and robust semantics by smoothing relations around the target interaction. By maximizing the mutual information between reliable structure and smoothed relations, BioKDN emphasizes informative semantics to enable precise predictions. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that BioKDN surpasses state-of-the-art models in DTI and DDI prediction tasks, confirming the effectiveness and robustness of BioKDN in denoising unreliable interactions within contaminated KGs</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00691v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an iterative algorithm for training nonparametric additive models that enjoys favorable memory storage and computational requirements. The algorithm can be viewed as the functional counterpart of stochastic gradient descent, applied to the coefficients of a truncated basis expansion of the component functions. We show that the resulting estimator satisfies an oracle inequality that allows for model mis-specification. In the well-specified setting, by choosing the learning rate carefully across three distinct stages of training, we demonstrate that its risk is minimax optimal in terms of the dependence on the dimensionality of the data and the size of the training sample. We also provide polynomial convergence rates even when the covariates do not have full support on their domain.</description>

      <title>Towards Enhancing the Reproducibility of Deep Learning Bugs: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03069v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: Deep learning has achieved remarkable progress in various domains. However, like any software system, deep learning systems contain bugs, some of which can have severe impacts, as evidenced by crashes involving autonomous vehicles. Despite substantial advancements in deep learning techniques, little research has focused on reproducing deep learning bugs, which is an essential step for their resolution. Existing literature suggests that only 3% of deep learning bugs are reproducible, underscoring the need for further research.
  Objective: This paper examines the reproducibility of deep learning bugs. We identify edit actions and useful information that could improve the reproducibility of deep learning bugs.
  Method: First, we construct a dataset of 668 deep-learning bugs from Stack Overflow and GitHub across three frameworks and 22 architectures. Second, out of the 668 bugs, we select 165 bugs using stratified sampling and attempt to determine their reproducibility. While reproducing these bugs, we identify edit actions and useful information for their reproduction. Third, we used the Apriori algorithm to identify useful information and edit actions required to reproduce specific types of bugs. Finally, we conducted a user study involving 22 developers to assess the effectiveness of our findings in real-life settings.
  Results: We successfully reproduced 148 out of 165 bugs attempted. We identified ten edit actions and five useful types of component information that can help us reproduce the deep learning bugs. With the help of our findings, the developers were able to reproduce 22.92% more bugs and reduce their reproduction time by 24.35%.
  Conclusions: Our research addresses the critical issue of deep learning bug reproducibility. Practitioners and researchers can leverage our findings to improve deep learning bug reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Point Cloud Matters: Rethinking the Impact of Different Observation Spaces on Robot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In robot learning, the observation space is crucial due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities, which can potentially become a bottleneck alongside policy design. In this study, we explore the influence of various observation spaces on robot learning, focusing on three predominant modalities: RGB, RGB-D, and point cloud. We introduce OBSBench, a benchmark comprising two simulators and 125 tasks, along with standardized pipelines for various encoders and policy baselines. Extensive experiments on diverse contact-rich manipulation tasks reveal a notable trend: point cloud-based methods, even those with the simplest designs, frequently outperform their RGB and RGB-D counterparts. This trend persists in both scenarios: training from scratch and utilizing pre-training. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that point cloud observations often yield better policy performance and significantly stronger generalization capabilities across various geometric and visual conditions. These outcomes suggest that the 3D point cloud is a valuable observation modality for intricate robotic tasks. We also suggest that incorporating both appearance and coordinate information can enhance the performance of point cloud methods. We hope our work provides valuable insights and guidance for designing more generalizable and robust robotic models.

      <title>TopoNav: Topological Navigation for Efficient Exploration in Sparse Reward Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous robots exploring unknown environments face a significant challenge: navigating effectively without prior maps and with limited external feedback. This challenge intensifies in sparse reward environments, where traditional exploration techniques often fail. In this paper, we present TopoNav, a novel topological navigation framework that integrates active mapping, hierarchical reinforcement learning, and intrinsic motivation to enable efficient goal-oriented exploration and navigation in sparse-reward settings. TopoNav dynamically constructs a topological map of the environment, capturing key locations and pathways. A two-level hierarchical policy architecture, comprising a high-level graph traversal policy and low-level motion control policies, enables effective navigation and obstacle avoidance while maintaining focus on the overall goal. Additionally, TopoNav incorporates intrinsic motivation to guide exploration toward relevant regions and frontier nodes in the topological map, addressing the challenges of sparse extrinsic rewards. We evaluate TopoNav both in the simulated and real-world off-road environments using a Clearpath Jackal robot, across three challenging navigation scenarios: goal-reaching, feature-based navigation, and navigation in complex terrains. We observe an increase in exploration coverage by 7- 20%, in success rates by 9-19%, and reductions in navigation times by 15-36% across various scenarios, compared to state-of-the-art methods</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning Bayesian Optimization to Design Competitor DNA Molecules for Use in Diagnostic Assays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise in engineered biomolecular devices, there is an increased need for tailor-made biological sequences. Often, many similar biological sequences need to be made for a specific application meaning numerous, sometimes prohibitively expensive, lab experiments are necessary for their optimization. This paper presents a transfer learning design of experiments workflow to make this development feasible. By combining a transfer learning surrogate model with Bayesian optimization, we show how the total number of experiments can be reduced by sharing information between optimization tasks. We demonstrate the reduction in the number of experiments using data from the development of DNA competitors for use in an amplification-based diagnostic assay. We use cross-validation to compare the predictive accuracy of different transfer learning models, and then compare the performance of the models for both single objective and penalized optimization tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce NADA, the first framework to autonomously design network algorithms by leveraging the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Starting with an existing algorithm implementation, NADA enables LLMs to create a wide variety of alternative designs in the form of code blocks. It then efficiently identifies the top-performing designs through a series of filtering techniques, minimizing the need for full-scale evaluations and significantly reducing computational costs. Using adaptive bitrate (ABR) streaming as a case study, we demonstrate that NADA produces novel ABR algorithms -- previously unknown to human developers -- that consistently outperform the original algorithm in diverse network environments, including broadband, satellite, 4G, and 5G.</description>

      <title>Agent-driven Generative Semantic Communication with Cross-Modality and Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of 6G, with compelling visions of intelligent transportation systems and digital twins, remote surveillance is poised to become a ubiquitous practice. Substantial data volume and frequent updates present challenges in wireless networks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel agent-driven generative semantic communication (A-GSC) framework based on reinforcement learning. In contrast to the existing research on semantic communication (SemCom), which mainly focuses on either semantic extraction or semantic sampling, we seamlessly integrate both by jointly considering the intrinsic attributes of source information and the contextual information regarding the task. Notably, the introduction of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) enables the independent design of semantic encoders and decoders. In this work, we develop an agent-assisted semantic encoder with cross-modality capability, which can track the semantic changes, channel condition, to perform adaptive semantic extraction and sampling. Accordingly, we design a semantic decoder with both predictive and generative capabilities, consisting of two tailored modules. Moreover, the effectiveness of the designed models has been verified using the UA-DETRAC dataset, demonstrating the performance gains of the overall A-GSC framework in both energy saving and reconstruction accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is significantly influenced by the quality of the prompts provided. In response, researchers have developed enormous prompt engineering strategies aimed at modifying the prompt text to enhance task performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique termed position engineering, which offers a more efficient way to guide large language models. Unlike prompt engineering, which requires substantial effort to modify the text provided to LLMs, position engineering merely involves altering the positional information in the prompt without modifying the text itself. We have evaluated position engineering in two widely-used LLM scenarios: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and in-context learning (ICL). Our findings show that position engineering substantially improves upon the baseline in both cases. Position engineering thus represents a promising new strategy for exploiting the capabilities of large language models.</description>

      <title>RectifID: Personalizing Rectified Flow with Anchored Classifier Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Customizing diffusion models to generate identity-preserving images from user-provided reference images is an intriguing new problem. The prevalent approaches typically require training on extensive domain-specific images to achieve identity preservation, which lacks flexibility across different use cases. To address this issue, we exploit classifier guidance, a training-free technique that steers diffusion models using an existing classifier, for personalized image generation. Our study shows that based on a recent rectified flow framework, the major limitation of vanilla classifier guidance in requiring a special classifier can be resolved with a simple fixed-point solution, allowing flexible personalization with off-the-shelf image discriminators. Moreover, its solving procedure proves to be stable when anchored to a reference flow trajectory, with a convergence guarantee. The derived method is implemented on rectified flow with different off-the-shelf image discriminators, delivering advantageous personalization results for human faces, live subjects, and certain objects. Code is available at https://github.com/feifeiobama/RectifID.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding the Working Mechanism of Text-to-Image Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the strong latent Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) has been applied to high-quality Text-to-Image (T2I) generation (e.g., Stable Diffusion), by injecting the encoded target text prompt into the gradually denoised diffusion image generator. Despite the success of DPM in practice, the mechanism behind it remains to be explored. To fill this blank, we begin by examining the intermediate statuses during the gradual denoising generation process in DPM. The empirical observations indicate, the shape of image is reconstructed after the first few denoising steps, and then the image is filled with details (e.g., texture). The phenomenon is because the low-frequency signal (shape relevant) of the noisy image is not corrupted until the final stage in the forward process (initial stage of generation) of adding noise in DPM. Inspired by the observations, we proceed to explore the influence of each token in the text prompt during the two stages. After a series of experiments of T2I generations conditioned on a set of text prompts. We conclude that in the earlier generation stage, the image is mostly decided by the special token [\texttt{EOS}] in the text prompt, and the information in the text prompt is already conveyed in this stage. After that, the diffusion model completes the details of generated images by information from themselves. Finally, we propose to apply this observation to accelerate the process of T2I generation by properly removing text guidance, which finally accelerates the sampling up to 25\%+.</description>

      <title>Superposed Decoding: Multiple Generations from a Single Autoregressive Inference Pass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18400v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many applications today provide users with multiple auto-complete drafts as they type, including GitHub's code completion, Gmail's smart compose, and Apple's messaging auto-suggestions. Under the hood, language models support this by running an autoregressive inference pass to provide a draft. Consequently, providing $k$ drafts to the user requires running an expensive language model $k$ times. To alleviate the computation cost of running $k$ inference passes, we propose Superposed Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that generates $k$ drafts at the computation cost of one autoregressive inference pass. We achieve this by feeding a superposition of the most recent token embeddings from the $k$ drafts as input to the next decoding step of the language model. At every inference step we combine the $k$ drafts with the top-$k$ tokens to get $k^2$ new drafts and cache the $k$ most likely options, using an n-gram interpolation with minimal compute overhead to filter out incoherent generations. Our experiments show that $k$ drafts from Superposed Decoding are at least as coherent and factual as Nucleus Sampling and Greedy Decoding respectively, while being at least $2.44\times$ faster for $k\ge3$. In a compute-normalized setting, user evaluations demonstrably favor text generated by Superposed Decoding over Nucleus Sampling. Superposed Decoding can also be combined with other decoding strategies, resulting in universal coverage gains when scaling inference time compute.

      <title>Faster Cascades via Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cascades and speculative decoding are two common approaches to improving language models' inference efficiency. Both approaches involve interleaving models of different sizes, but via fundamentally distinct mechanisms: cascades employ a deferral rule that invokes the larger model only for "hard" inputs, while speculative decoding uses speculative execution to primarily invoke the larger model in parallel verification mode. These mechanisms offer different benefits: empirically, cascades offer better cost-quality trade-offs, often even outperforming the large model, while theoretically, speculative decoding offers a guarantee of quality-neutrality. In this paper, we leverage the best of both these approaches by designing new speculative cascading techniques that implement their deferral rule through speculative execution. We characterize the optimal deferral rule for our speculative cascades, and employ a plug-in approximation to the optimal rule. Experiments with Gemma and T5 models on a range of language benchmarks show that our approach yields better cost quality trade-offs than cascading and speculative decoding baselines.</description>

      <title>ControlSpeech: Towards Simultaneous Zero-shot Speaker Cloning and Zero-shot Language Style Control With Decoupled Codec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present ControlSpeech, a text-to-speech (TTS) system capable of fully cloning the speaker's voice and enabling arbitrary control and adjustment of speaking style, merely based on a few seconds of audio prompt and a simple textual style description prompt. Prior zero-shot TTS models and controllable TTS models either could only mimic the speaker's voice without further control and adjustment capabilities or were unrelated to speaker-specific voice generation. Therefore, ControlSpeech focuses on a more challenging new task-a TTS system with controllable timbre, content, and style at the same time. ControlSpeech takes speech prompts, content prompts, and style prompts as inputs and utilizes bidirectional attention and mask-based parallel decoding to capture corresponding codec representations in a discrete decoupling codec space. Moreover, we discovered the issue of text style controllability in a many-to-many mapping fashion and proposed the Style Mixture Semantic Density (SMSD) model to resolve this problem. SMSD module which is based on Gaussian mixture density networks, is designed to enhance the fine-grained partitioning and sampling capabilities of style semantic information and generate speech with more diverse styles. In terms of experiments, we make available a controllable model toolkit called ControlToolkit with a new style controllable dataset, some replicated baseline models and propose new metrics to evaluate both the control capability and the quality of generated audio in ControlSpeech. The relevant ablation studies validate the necessity of each component in ControlSpeech is necessary. We hope that ControlSpeech can establish the next foundation paradigm of controllable speech synthesis.

      <title>Critical Phase Transition in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance. To understand their behaviors, we need to consider the fact that LLMs sometimes show qualitative changes. The natural world also presents such changes called phase transitions, which are defined by singular, divergent statistical quantities. Therefore, an intriguing question is whether qualitative changes in LLMs are phase transitions. In this work, we have conducted extensive analysis on texts generated by LLMs and suggested that a phase transition occurs in LLMs when varying the temperature parameter. Specifically, statistical quantities have divergent properties just at the point between the low-temperature regime, where LLMs generate sentences with clear repetitive structures, and the high-temperature regime, where generated sentences are often incomprehensible. In addition, critical behaviors near the phase transition point, such as a power-law decay of correlation and slow convergence toward the stationary state, are similar to those in natural languages. Our results suggest a meaningful analogy between LLMs and natural phenomena.</description>

      <title>PRIMER: Perception-Aware Robust Learning-based Multiagent Trajectory Planner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In decentralized multiagent trajectory planners, agents need to communicate and exchange their positions to generate collision-free trajectories. However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Finite Operator Learning: Bridging Neural Operators and Numerical Methods for Efficient Parametric Solution and Optimization of PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method that combines neural operators, physics-informed machine learning, and standard numerical methods for solving PDEs. The proposed approach extends each of the aforementioned methods and unifies them within a single framework. We can parametrically solve partial differential equations in a data-free manner and provide accurate sensitivities, meaning the derivatives of the solution space with respect to the design space. These capabilities enable gradient-based optimization without the typical sensitivity analysis costs, unlike adjoint methods that scale directly with the number of response functions. Our Finite Operator Learning (FOL) approach uses an uncomplicated feed-forward neural network model to directly map the discrete design space (i.e. parametric input space) to the discrete solution space (i.e. finite number of sensor points in the arbitrary shape domain) ensuring compliance with physical laws by designing them into loss functions. The discretized governing equations, as well as the design and solution spaces, can be derived from any well-established numerical techniques. In this work, we employ the Finite Element Method (FEM) to approximate fields and their spatial derivatives. Subsequently, we conduct Sobolev training to minimize a multi-objective loss function, which includes the discretized weak form of the energy functional, boundary conditions violations, and the stationarity of the residuals with respect to the design variables. Our study focuses on the steady-state heat equation within heterogeneous materials that exhibits significant phase contrast and possibly temperature-dependent conductivity. The network's tangent matrix is directly used for gradient-based optimization to improve the microstructure's heat transfer characteristics. ...</description>

      <title>On high-dimensional modifications of the nearest neighbor classifier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nearest neighbor classifier is arguably the most simple and popular nonparametric classifier available in the literature. However, due to the concentration of pairwise distances and the violation of the neighborhood structure, this classifier often suffers in high-dimension, low-sample size (HDLSS) situations, especially when the scale difference between the competing classes dominates their location difference. Several attempts have been made in the literature to take care of this problem. In this article, we discuss some of these existing methods and propose some new ones. We carry out some theoretical investigations in this regard and analyze several simulated and benchmark datasets to compare the empirical performances of proposed methods with some of the existing ones.</description>

      <title>ReCAP: Recursive Cross Attention Network for Pseudo-Label Generation in Robotic Surgical Skill Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In surgical skill assessment, Objective Structured Assessments of Technical Skills (OSATS scores) and the Global Rating Scale (GRS) are established tools for evaluating the performance of surgeons during training. These metrics, coupled with feedback on their performance, enable surgeons to improve and achieve standards of practice. Recent studies on the open-source dataset JIGSAW, which contains both GRS and OSATS labels, have focused on regressing GRS scores from kinematic signals, video data, or a combination of both. In this paper, we argue that regressing the GRS score, a unitless value, by itself is too restrictive, and variations throughout the surgical trial do not hold significant clinical meaning. To address this gap, we developed a recurrent transformer model that outputs the surgeon's performance throughout their training session by relating the model's hidden states to five OSATS scores derived from kinematic signals. These scores are averaged and aggregated to produce a GRS prediction, enabling assessment of the model's performance against the state-of-the-art (SOTA). We report Spearman's Correlation Coefficient (SCC), demonstrating that our model outperforms SOTA models for all tasks, except for Suturing under the leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) scheme (SCC 0.68-0.89), while achieving comparable performance for suturing and across tasks under the leave-one-user-out (LOUO) scheme (SCC 0.45-0.68) and beating SOTA for Needle Passing (0.69). We argue that relating final OSATS scores to short instances throughout a surgeon's procedure is more clinically meaningful than a single GRS score. This approach also allows us to translate quantitative predictions into qualitative feedback, which is crucial for any automated surgical skill assessment pipeline. A senior surgeon validated our model's behaviour and agreed with the semi-supervised predictions 77 \% (p = 0.006) of the time.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Comparison of Vocabulary Expansion and Initialization Approaches for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language Models (LMs) excel in natural language processing tasks for English but show reduced performance in most other languages. This problem is commonly tackled by continually pre-training and fine-tuning these models for said languages. A significant issue in this process is the limited vocabulary coverage in the original model's tokenizer, leading to inadequate representation of new languages and necessitating an expansion of the tokenizer. The initialization of the embeddings corresponding to new vocabulary items presents a further challenge. Current strategies require cross-lingual embeddings and lack a solid theoretical foundation as well as comparisons with strong baselines. In this paper, we first establish theoretically that initializing within the convex hull of existing embeddings is a good initialization, followed by a novel but simple approach, Constrained Word2Vec (CW2V), which does not require cross-lingual embeddings. Our study evaluates different initialization methods for expanding RoBERTa and LLaMA 2 across four languages and five tasks. The results show that CW2V performs equally well or even better than more advanced techniques. Additionally, simpler approaches like multivariate initialization perform on par with these advanced methods indicating that efficient large-scale multilingual continued pretraining can be achieved even with simpler initialization methods. We release our code publicly (https://github.com/AI4Bharat/VocabAdaptation_LLM/tree/CW2V).</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Modular Framework for Low-Cost Open-Vocabulary Object Detection Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Object detection is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, centered on recognizing objects within images, with diverse applications in areas like image analysis, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. Although existing methods have achieved great success, they are often constrained by a fixed vocabulary of objects. To overcome this limitation, approaches like MDETR have redefined object detection by incorporating region-level vision-language pre-training, enabling open-vocabulary object detectors. However, these methods are computationally heavy due to the simultaneous training of large models for both vision and language representations. To address this, we introduce a lightweight framework that significantly reduces the number of parameters while preserving, or even improving, performance. Our solution is applied to MDETR, resulting in the development of Lightweight MDETR (LightMDETR), an optimized version of MDETR designed to enhance computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. The core of our approach involves freezing the MDETR backbone and training only the Universal Projection module (UP), which bridges vision and language representations. A learnable modality token parameter allows the UP to seamlessly switch between modalities. Evaluations on tasks like phrase grounding, referring expression comprehension, and segmentation show that LightMDETR not only reduces computational costs but also outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy.</description>

      <title>WavTokenizer: an Efficient Acoustic Discrete Codec Tokenizer for Audio Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models have been effectively applied to modeling natural signals, such as images, video, speech, and audio. A crucial component of these models is the codec tokenizer, which compresses high-dimensional natural signals into lower-dimensional discrete tokens. In this paper, we introduce WavTokenizer, which offers several advantages over previous SOTA acoustic codec models in the audio domain: 1)extreme compression. By compressing the layers of quantizers and the temporal dimension of the discrete codec, one-second audio of 24kHz sampling rate requires only a single quantizer with 40 or 75 tokens. 2)improved subjective quality. Despite the reduced number of tokens, WavTokenizer achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with outstanding UTMOS scores and inherently contains richer semantic information. Specifically, we achieve these results by designing a broader VQ space, extended contextual windows, and improved attention networks, as well as introducing a powerful multi-scale discriminator and an inverse Fourier transform structure. We conducted extensive reconstruction experiments in the domains of speech, audio, and music. WavTokenizer exhibited strong performance across various objective and subjective metrics compared to state-of-the-art models. We also tested semantic information, VQ utilization, and adaptability to generative models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each module in WavTokenizer. The related code, demos, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/jishengpeng/WavTokenizer.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Large Language Models in Academia: from Writing to Speaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly impacting human society, particularly in textual information. Based on more than 30,000 papers and 1,000 presentations from machine learning conferences, we examined and compared the words used in writing and speaking, representing the first large-scale study of how LLMs influence the two main modes of verbal communication and expression within the same group of people. Our empirical results show that LLM-style words such as "significant" have been used more frequently in abstracts and oral presentations. The impact on speaking is beginning to emerge and is likely to grow in the future, calling attention to the implicit influence and ripple effect of LLMs on human society.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Increasing use of large language models (LLMs) demand performant guardrails to ensure the safety of inputs and outputs of LLMs. When these safeguards are trained on imbalanced data, they can learn the societal biases. We present a light-weight, post-processing method for mitigating counterfactual fairness in closed-source text safety classifiers. Our approach involves building an ensemble that not only outperforms the input classifiers and policy-aligns them, but also acts as a debiasing regularizer. We introduce two threshold-agnostic metrics to assess the counterfactual fairness of a model, and demonstrate how combining these metrics with Fair Data Reweighting (FDW) helps mitigate biases. We create an expanded Open AI dataset, and a new templated LLM-generated dataset based on user-prompts, both of which are counterfactually balanced across identity groups and cover four key areas of safety; we will work towards publicly releasing these datasets. Our results show that our approach improves counterfactual fairness with minimal impact on model performance.</description>

      <title>Developing a Thailand solar irradiance map using Himawari-8 satellite imageries and deep learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an online platform that shows Thailand's solar irradiance map every 30 minutes. It is available at https://www.cusolarforecast.com. The methodology for estimating global horizontal irradiance (GHI) across Thailand relies on cloud index extracted from Himawari-8 satellite imagery, Ineichen clear-sky model with locally-tuned Linke turbidity, and machine learning models. The methods take clear-sky irradiance, cloud index, re-analyzed GHI and temperature data from the MERRA-2 database, and date-time as inputs for GHI estimation models, including LightGBM, LSTM, Informer, and Transformer. These are benchmarked with the estimate from a commercial service X by evaluating 15-minute ground GHI data from 53 ground stations over 1.5 years from 2022-2023. The results show that the four models have competitive performances and outperform the service X. The best model is LightGBM, with an MAE of 78.58 W/sqm and RMSE of 118.97 W/sqm. Obtaining re-analyzed MERRA-2 data for Thailand is not economically feasible for deployment. When removing these features, the Informer model has a winning performance of 78.67 W/sqm in MAE. The obtained performance aligns with existing literature by taking the climate zone and time granularity of data into consideration. As the map shows an estimate of GHI over 93,000 grids with a frequent update, the paper also describes a computational framework for displaying the entire map. It tests the runtime performance of deep learning models in the GHI estimation process.</description>

      <title>Accelerating PoT Quantization on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-uniform quantization, such as power-of-two (PoT) quantization, matches data distributions better than uniform quantization, which reduces the quantization error of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). PoT quantization also allows bit-shift operations to replace multiplications, but there are limited studies on the efficiency of shift-based accelerators for PoT quantization. Furthermore, existing pipelines for accelerating PoT-quantized DNNs on edge devices are not open-source. In this paper, we first design shift-based processing elements (shift-PE) for different PoT quantization methods and evaluate their efficiency using synthetic benchmarks. Then we design a shift-based accelerator using our most efficient shift-PE and propose PoTAcc, an open-source pipeline for end-to-end acceleration of PoT-quantized DNNs on resource-constrained edge devices. Using PoTAcc, we evaluate the performance of our shift-based accelerator across three DNNs. On average, it achieves a 1.23x speedup and 1.24x energy reduction compared to a multiplier-based accelerator, and a 2.46x speedup and 1.83x energy reduction compared to CPU-only execution. Our code is available at https://github.com/gicLAB/PoTAcc</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce PLaMo-100B, a large-scale language model designed for Japanese proficiency. The model was trained from scratch using 2 trillion tokens, with architecture such as QK Normalization and Z-Loss to ensure training stability during the training process. Post-training techniques, including Supervised Fine-Tuning and Direct Preference Optimization, were applied to refine the model's performance. Benchmark evaluations suggest that PLaMo-100B performs well, particularly in Japanese-specific tasks, achieving results that are competitive with frontier models like GPT-4. The base model is available at https://huggingface.co/pfnet/plamo-100b.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Personalization in FedProx: A Fine-grained Analysis on Statistical Accuracy and Communication Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: FedProx is a simple yet effective federated learning method that enables model personalization via regularization. Despite remarkable success in practice, a rigorous analysis of how such a regularization provably improves the statistical accuracy of each client's local model hasn't been fully established. Setting the regularization strength heuristically presents a risk, as an inappropriate choice may even degrade accuracy. This work fills in the gap by analyzing the effect of regularization on statistical accuracy, thereby providing a theoretical guideline for setting the regularization strength for achieving personalization. We prove that by adaptively choosing the regularization strength under different statistical heterogeneity, FedProx can consistently outperform pure local training and achieve a nearly minimax-optimal statistical rate. In addition, to shed light on resource allocation, we design an algorithm, provably showing that stronger personalization reduces communication complexity without increasing the computation cost overhead. Finally, our theory is validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets and its generalizability is verified in a non-convex setting.</description>

      <title>LLM Gesticulator: Leveraging Large Language Models for Scalable and Controllable Co-Speech Gesture Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present LLM Gesticulator, an LLM-based audio-driven co-speech gesture generation framework that synthesizes full-body animations that are rhythmically aligned with the input audio while exhibiting natural movements and editability. Compared to previous work, our model demonstrates substantial scalability. As the size of the backbone LLM model increases, our framework shows proportional improvements in evaluation metrics (a.k.a. scaling law). Our method also exhibits strong controllability where the content, style of the generated gestures can be controlled by text prompt. To the best of our knowledge, LLM gesticulator is the first work that use LLM on the co-speech generation task. Evaluation with existing objective metrics and user studies indicate that our framework outperforms prior works.</description>

      <title>Towards Fair Graph Representation Learning in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the widespread use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for representation learning from network data, the fairness of GNN models has raised great attention lately. Fair GNNs aim to ensure that node representations can be accurately classified, but not easily associated with a specific group. Existing advanced approaches essentially enhance the generalisation of node representation in combination with data augmentation strategy, and do not directly impose constraints on the fairness of GNNs. In this work, we identify that a fundamental reason for the unfairness of GNNs in social network learning is the phenomenon of social homophily, i.e., users in the same group are more inclined to congregate. The message-passing mechanism of GNNs can cause users in the same group to have similar representations due to social homophily, leading model predictions to establish spurious correlations with sensitive attributes. Inspired by this reason, we propose a method called Equity-Aware GNN (EAGNN) towards fair graph representation learning. Specifically, to ensure that model predictions are independent of sensitive attributes while maintaining prediction performance, we introduce constraints for fair representation learning based on three principles: sufficiency, independence, and separation. We theoretically demonstrate that our EAGNN method can effectively achieve group fairness. Extensive experiments on three datasets with varying levels of social homophily illustrate that our EAGNN method achieves the state-of-the-art performance across two fairness metrics and offers competitive effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Refusal-Trained LLMs Are Easily Jailbroken As Browser Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For safety reasons, large language models (LLMs) are trained to refuse harmful user instructions, such as assisting dangerous activities. We study an open question in this work: does the desired safety refusal, typically enforced in chat contexts, generalize to non-chat and agentic use cases? Unlike chatbots, LLM agents equipped with general-purpose tools, such as web browsers and mobile devices, can directly influence the real world, making it even more crucial to refuse harmful instructions. In this work, we primarily focus on red-teaming browser agents, LLMs that manipulate information via web browsers. To this end, we introduce Browser Agent Red teaming Toolkit (BrowserART), a comprehensive test suite designed specifically for red-teaming browser agents. BrowserART is consist of 100 diverse browser-related harmful behaviors (including original behaviors and ones sourced from HarmBench [Mazeika et al., 2024] and AirBench 2024 [Zeng et al., 2024b]) across both synthetic and real websites. Our empirical study on state-of-the-art browser agents reveals that, while the backbone LLM refuses harmful instructions as a chatbot, the corresponding agent does not. Moreover, attack methods designed to jailbreak refusal-trained LLMs in the chat settings transfer effectively to browser agents. With human rewrites, GPT-4o and o1-preview-based browser agents attempted 98 and 63 harmful behaviors (out of 100), respectively. We publicly release BrowserART and call on LLM developers, policymakers, and agent developers to collaborate on improving agent safety</description>

      <title>Can AI weather models predict out-of-distribution gray swan tropical cyclones?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting gray swan weather extremes, which are possible but so rare that they are absent from the training dataset, is a major concern for AI weather/climate models. An important open question is whether AI models can extrapolate from weaker weather events present in the training set to stronger, unseen weather extremes. To test this, we train independent versions of the AI model FourCastNet on the 1979-2015 ERA5 dataset with all data, or with Category 3-5 tropical cyclones (TCs) removed, either globally or only over the North Atlantic or Western Pacific basin. We then test these versions of FourCastNet on 2018-2023 Category 5 TCs (gray swans). All versions yield similar accuracy for global weather, but the one trained without Category 3-5 TCs cannot accurately forecast Category 5 TCs, indicating that these models cannot extrapolate from weaker storms. The versions trained without Category 3-5 TCs in one basin show some skill forecasting Category 5 TCs in that basin, suggesting that FourCastNet can generalize across tropical basins. This is encouraging and surprising because regional information is implicitly encoded in inputs. No version satisfies gradient-wind balance, implying that enforcing such physical constraints may not improve generalizability to gray swans. Given that current state-of-the-art AI weather/climate models have similar learning strategies, we expect our findings to apply to other models and extreme events. Our work demonstrates that novel learning strategies are needed for AI weather/climate models to provide early warning or estimated statistics for the rarest, most impactful weather extremes.</description>

      <title>Wireless Link Quality Estimation Using LSTM Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, various services have been provided through high-speed and high-capacity wireless networks on mobile communication devices, necessitating stable communication regardless of indoor or outdoor environments. To achieve stable communication, it is essential to implement proactive measures, such as switching to an alternative path and ensuring data buffering before the communication quality becomes unstable. The technology of Wireless Link Quality Estimation (WLQE), which predicts the communication quality of wireless networks in advance, plays a crucial role in this context. In this paper, we propose a novel WLQE model for estimating the communication quality of wireless networks by leveraging sequential information. Our proposed method is based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), enabling highly accurate estimation by considering the sequential information of link quality. We conducted a comparative evaluation with the conventional model, stacked autoencoder-based link quality estimator (LQE-SAE), using a dataset recorded in real-world environmental conditions. Our LSTM-based LQE model demonstrates its superiority, achieving a 4.0% higher accuracy and a 4.6% higher macro-F1 score than the LQE-SAE model in the evaluation.</description>

      <title>Multi-Layer Feature Fusion with Cross-Channel Attention-Based U-Net for Kidney Tumor Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renal tumors, especially renal cell carcinoma (RCC), show significant heterogeneity, posing challenges for diagnosis using radiology images such as MRI, echocardiograms, and CT scans. U-Net based deep learning techniques are emerging as a promising approach for automated medical image segmentation for minimally invasive diagnosis of renal tumors. However, current techniques need further improvements in accuracy to become clinically useful to radiologists. In this study, we present an improved U-Net based model for end-to-end automated semantic segmentation of CT scan images to identify renal tumors. The model uses residual connections across convolution layers, integrates a multi-layer feature fusion (MFF) and cross-channel attention (CCA) within encoder blocks, and incorporates skip connections augmented with additional information derived using MFF and CCA. We evaluated our model on the KiTS19 dataset, which contains data from 210 patients. For kidney segmentation, our model achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.97 and a Jaccard index (JI) of 0.95. For renal tumor segmentation, our model achieves a DSC of 0.96 and a JI of 0.91. Based on a comparison of available DSC scores, our model outperforms the current leading models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Moonshine, a family of speech recognition models optimized for live transcription and voice command processing. Moonshine is based on an encoder-decoder transformer architecture and employs Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) instead of traditional absolute position embeddings. The model is trained on speech segments of various lengths, but without using zero-padding, leading to greater efficiency for the encoder during inference time. When benchmarked against OpenAI's Whisper tiny-en, Moonshine Tiny demonstrates a 5x reduction in compute requirements for transcribing a 10-second speech segment while incurring no increase in word error rates across standard evaluation datasets. These results highlight Moonshine's potential for real-time and resource-constrained applications.</description>

      <title>Reducing Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models via Latent Space Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hallucination poses a challenge to the deployment of large vision-language models (LVLMs) in applications. Unlike in large language models (LLMs), hallucination in LVLMs often arises from misalignments between visual inputs and textual outputs. This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of hallucination, focusing on the unique structure of LVLMs that distinguishes them from large language models (LLMs). We identify that hallucinations often arise from the sensitivity of text decoders to vision inputs, a natural phenomenon when image encoders and text decoders are pre-trained separately. Inspired by this, we introduce Visual and Textual Intervention (VTI), a novel technique designed to reduce hallucinations by steering latent space representations during inference to enhance the stability of vision features. As a task-agnostic test-time intervention, VTI can be easily applied to any problem without additional cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it can effectively reduce hallucinations and outperform baseline methods across multiple metrics, highlighting the critical role of vision feature stability in LVLMs.</description>

Abstract: Using image models naively for solving inverse video problems often suffers from flickering, texture-sticking, and temporal inconsistency in generated videos. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we view frames as continuous functions in the 2D space, and videos as a sequence of continuous warping transformations between different frames. This perspective allows us to train function space diffusion models only on images and utilize them to solve temporally correlated inverse problems. The function space diffusion models need to be equivariant with respect to the underlying spatial transformations. To ensure temporal consistency, we introduce a simple post-hoc test-time guidance towards (self)-equivariant solutions. Our method allows us to deploy state-of-the-art latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion XL to solve video inverse problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for video inpainting and $8\times$ video super-resolution, outperforming existing techniques based on noise transformations.
