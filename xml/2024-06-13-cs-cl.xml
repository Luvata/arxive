      <title>Enhancing Presentation Slide Generation by LLMs with a Multi-Staged End-to-End Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating presentation slides from a long document with multimodal elements such as text and images is an important task. This is time consuming and needs domain expertise if done manually. Existing approaches for generating a rich presentation from a document are often semi-automatic or only put a flat summary into the slides ignoring the importance of a good narrative. In this paper, we address this research gap by proposing a multi-staged end-to-end model which uses a combination of LLM and VLM. We have experimentally shown that compared to applying LLMs directly with state-of-the-art prompting, our proposed multi-staged solution is better in terms of automated metrics and human evaluation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Text Authenticity: A Novel Hybrid Approach for AI-Generated Text Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in an era where AI-generated text is increasingly indistinguishable from human-generated content. Detecting AI-generated text has become imperative to combat misinformation, ensure content authenticity, and safeguard against malicious uses of AI. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach that combines traditional TF-IDF techniques with advanced machine learning models, including Bayesian classifiers, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Categorical Gradient Boosting (CatBoost), and 12 instances of Deberta-v3-large models. Our approach aims to address the challenges associated with detecting AI-generated text by leveraging the strengths of both traditional feature extraction methods and state-of-the-art deep learning models. Through extensive experiments on a comprehensive dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in accurately distinguishing between human and AI-generated text. Our approach achieves superior performance compared to existing methods. This research contributes to the advancement of AI-generated text detection techniques and lays the foundation for developing robust solutions to mitigate the challenges posed by AI-generated content.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Fortune Analytics Language Model (FALM). FALM empowers users with direct access to comprehensive business analysis, including market trends, company performance metrics, and expert insights. Unlike generic LLMs, FALM leverages a curated knowledge base built from professional journalism, enabling it to deliver precise and in-depth answers to intricate business questions. Users can further leverage natural language queries to directly visualize financial data, generating insightful charts and graphs to understand trends across diverse business sectors clearly. FALM fosters user trust and ensures output accuracy through three novel methods: 1) Time-aware reasoning guarantees accurate event registration and prioritizes recent updates. 2) Thematic trend analysis explicitly examines topic evolution over time, providing insights into emerging business landscapes. 3) Content referencing and task decomposition enhance answer fidelity and data visualization accuracy. We conduct both automated and human evaluations, demonstrating FALM's significant performance improvements over baseline methods while prioritizing responsible AI practices. These benchmarks establish FALM as a cutting-edge LLM in the business and media domains, with exceptional accuracy and trustworthiness.</description>

      <title>Inverse Constitutional AI: Compressing Preferences into Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback data plays an important role in fine-tuning and evaluating state-of-the-art AI models. Often pairwise text preferences are used: given two texts, human (or AI) annotators select the "better" one. Such feedback data is widely used to align models to human preferences (e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback), or to rank models according to human preferences (e.g., Chatbot Arena). Despite its wide-spread use, prior work has demonstrated that human-annotated pairwise text preference data often exhibits unintended biases. For example, human annotators have been shown to prefer assertive over truthful texts in certain contexts. Models trained or evaluated on this data may implicitly encode these biases in a manner hard to identify. In this paper, we formulate the interpretation of existing pairwise text preference data as a compression task: the Inverse Constitutional AI (ICAI) problem. In constitutional AI, a set of principles (or constitution) is used to provide feedback and fine-tune AI models. The ICAI problem inverts this process: given a dataset of feedback, we aim to extract a constitution that best enables a large language model (LLM) to reconstruct the original annotations. We propose a corresponding initial ICAI algorithm and validate its generated constitutions quantitatively based on reconstructed annotations. Generated constitutions have many potential use-cases -- they may help identify undesirable biases, scale feedback to unseen data or assist with adapting LLMs to individual user preferences. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of datasets: (a) synthetic feedback datasets with known underlying principles; (b) the AlpacaEval dataset of cross-annotated human feedback; and (c) the crowdsourced Chatbot Arena data set. We release the code for our algorithm and experiments at https://github.com/rdnfn/icai .</description>

      <title>Brainstorming Brings Power to Large Language Models of Knowledge Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated amazing capabilities in language generation, text comprehension, and knowledge reasoning. While a single powerful model can already handle multiple tasks, relying on a single perspective can lead to biased and unstable results. Recent studies have further improved the model's reasoning ability on a wide range of tasks by introducing multi-model collaboration. However, models with different capabilities may produce conflicting answers on the same problem, and how to reasonably obtain the correct answer from multiple candidate models has become a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose the multi-model brainstorming based on prompt. It incorporates different models into a group for brainstorming, and after multiple rounds of reasoning elaboration and re-inference, a consensus answer is reached within the group. We conducted experiments on three different types of datasets, and demonstrate that the brainstorming can significantly improve the effectiveness in logical reasoning and fact extraction. Furthermore, we find that two small-parameter models can achieve accuracy approximating that of larger-parameter models through brainstorming, which provides a new solution for distributed deployment of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Achieving Sparse Activation in Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse activation, which selectively activates only an input-dependent set of neurons in inference, is a useful technique to reduce the computing cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) without retraining or adaptation efforts. However, whether it can be applied to the recently emerging Small Language Models (SLMs) remains questionable, because SLMs are generally less over-parameterized than LLMs. In this paper, we aim to achieve sparse activation in SLMs. We first show that the existing sparse activation schemes in LLMs that build on neurons' output magnitudes cannot be applied to SLMs, and activating neurons based on their attribution scores is a better alternative. Further, we demonstrated and quantified the large errors of existing attribution metrics when being used for sparse activation, due to the interdependency among attribution scores of neurons across different layers. Based on these observations, we proposed a new attribution metric that can provably correct such errors and achieve precise sparse activation. Experiments over multiple popular SLMs and datasets show that our approach can achieve 80% sparsification ratio with &lt;5% model accuracy loss, comparable to the sparse activation achieved in LLMs. The source code is available at: https://github.com/pittisl/Sparse-Activation.</description>

      <title>Skywork-MoE: A Deep Dive into Training Techniques for Mixture-of-Experts Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this technical report, we introduce the training methodologies implemented in the development of Skywork-MoE, a high-performance mixture-of-experts (MoE) large language model (LLM) with 146 billion parameters and 16 experts. It is initialized from the pre-existing dense checkpoints of our Skywork-13B model. We explore the comparative effectiveness of upcycling versus training from scratch initializations. Our findings suggest that the choice between these two approaches should consider both the performance of the existing dense checkpoints and the MoE training budget. We highlight two innovative techniques: gating logit normalization, which improves expert diversification, and adaptive auxiliary loss coefficients, allowing for layer-specific adjustment of auxiliary loss coefficients. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of these methods. Leveraging these techniques and insights, we trained our upcycled Skywork-MoE on a condensed subset of our SkyPile corpus. The evaluation results demonstrate that our model delivers strong performance across a wide range of benchmarks.</description>

      <title>MixEval: Deriving Wisdom of the Crowd from LLM Benchmark Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is challenging. Traditional ground-truth-based benchmarks fail to capture the comprehensiveness and nuance of real-world queries, while LLM-as-judge benchmarks suffer from grading biases and limited query quantity. Both of them may also become contaminated over time. User-facing evaluation, such as Chatbot Arena, provides reliable signals but is costly and slow. In this work, we propose MixEval, a new paradigm for establishing efficient, gold-standard LLM evaluation by strategically mixing off-the-shelf benchmarks. It bridges (1) comprehensive and well-distributed real-world user queries and (2) efficient and fairly-graded ground-truth-based benchmarks, by matching queries mined from the web with similar queries from existing benchmarks. Based on MixEval, we further build MixEval-Hard, which offers more room for model improvement. Our benchmarks' advantages lie in (1) a 0.96 model ranking correlation with Chatbot Arena arising from the highly impartial query distribution and grading mechanism, (2) fast, cheap, and reproducible execution (6% of the time and cost of MMLU), and (3) dynamic evaluation enabled by the rapid and stable data update pipeline. We provide extensive meta-evaluation and analysis for our and existing LLM benchmarks to deepen the community's understanding of LLM evaluation and guide future research directions.</description>

      <title>RAG Enabled Conversations about Household Electricity Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the integration of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama to enhance the accuracy and specificity of responses to complex questions about electricity datasets. Recognizing the limitations of LLMs in generating precise and contextually relevant answers due to their dependency on the patterns in training data rather than factual understanding, we propose a solution that leverages a specialized electricity knowledge graph. This approach facilitates the retrieval of accurate, real-time data which is then synthesized with the generative capabilities of LLMs. Our findings illustrate that the RAG approach not only reduces the incidence of incorrect information typically generated by LLMs but also significantly improves the quality of the output by grounding responses in verifiable data. This paper details our methodology, presents a comparative analysis of responses with and without RAG, and discusses the implications of our findings for future applications of AI in specialized sectors like energy data analysis.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Clinical Documentation with Synthetic Data: Leveraging Generative Models for Improved Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and comprehensive clinical documentation is crucial for delivering high-quality healthcare, facilitating effective communication among providers, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. However, manual transcription and data entry processes can be time-consuming, error-prone, and susceptible to inconsistencies, leading to incomplete or inaccurate medical records. This paper proposes a novel approach to augment clinical documentation by leveraging synthetic data generation techniques to generate realistic and diverse clinical transcripts. We present a methodology that combines state-of-the-art generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), with real-world clinical transcript and other forms of clinical data to generate synthetic transcripts. These synthetic transcripts can then be used to supplement existing documentation workflows, providing additional training data for natural language processing models and enabling more accurate and efficient transcription processes. Through extensive experiments on a large dataset of anonymized clinical transcripts, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating high-quality synthetic transcripts that closely resemble real-world data. Quantitative evaluation metrics, including perplexity scores and BLEU scores, as well as qualitative assessments by domain experts, validate the fidelity and utility of the generated synthetic transcripts. Our findings highlight synthetic data generation's potential to address clinical documentation challenges, improving patient care, reducing administrative burdens, and enhancing healthcare system efficiency.</description>

      <title>Review of Computational Epigraphy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational Epigraphy refers to the process of extracting text from stone inscription, transliteration, interpretation, and attribution with the aid of computational methods. Traditional epigraphy methods are time consuming, and tend to damage the stone inscriptions while extracting text. Additionally, interpretation and attribution are subjective and can vary between different epigraphers. However, using modern computation methods can not only be used to extract text, but also interpret and attribute the text in a robust way. We survey and document the existing computational methods that aid in the above-mentioned tasks in epigraphy.</description>

      <title>SUBLLM: A Novel Efficient Architecture with Token Sequence Subsampling for LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various fields, the efficiency of training and inference remains a major challenge. To address this issue, we propose SUBLLM, short for Subsampling-Upsampling-Bypass Large Language Model, an innovative architecture that extends the core decoder-only framework by incorporating subsampling, upsampling, and bypass modules. The subsampling modules are responsible for shortening the sequence, while the upsampling modules restore the sequence length, and the bypass modules enhance convergence. In comparison to LLaMA, the proposed SUBLLM exhibits significant enhancements in both training and inference speeds as well as memory usage, while maintaining competitive few-shot performance. During training, SUBLLM increases speeds by 26% and cuts memory by 10GB per GPU. In inference, it boosts speeds by up to 37% and reduces memory by 1GB per GPU. The training and inference speeds can be enhanced by 34% and 52% respectively when the context window is expanded to 8192. We shall release the source code of the proposed architecture in the published version.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network Enhanced Retrieval for Question Answering of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation has revolutionized large language model (LLM) outputs by providing factual supports. Nevertheless, it struggles to capture all the necessary knowledge for complex reasoning questions. Existing retrieval methods typically divide reference documents into passages, treating them in isolation. These passages, however, are often interrelated, such as passages that are contiguous or share the same keywords. Therefore, recognizing the relatedness is crucial for enhancing the retrieval process. In this paper, we propose a novel retrieval method, called GNN-Ret, which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance retrieval by considering the relatedness between passages. Specifically, we first construct a graph of passages by connecting passages that are structure-related and keyword-related. A graph neural network (GNN) is then leveraged to exploit the relationships between passages and improve the retrieval of supporting passages. Furthermore, we extend our method to handle multi-hop reasoning questions using a recurrent graph neural network (RGNN), named RGNN-Ret. At each step, RGNN-Ret integrates the graphs of passages from previous steps, thereby enhancing the retrieval of supporting passages. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GNN-Ret achieves higher accuracy for question answering with a single query of LLMs than strong baselines that require multiple queries, and RGNN-Ret further improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance, with up to 10.4% accuracy improvement on the 2WikiMQA dataset.</description>

      <title>MedFuzz: Exploring the Robustness of Large Language Models in Medical Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have achieved impressive performance on medical question-answering benchmarks. However, high benchmark accuracy does not imply that the performance generalizes to real-world clinical settings. Medical question-answering benchmarks rely on assumptions consistent with quantifying LLM performance but that may not hold in the open world of the clinic. Yet LLMs learn broad knowledge that can help the LLM generalize to practical conditions regardless of unrealistic assumptions in celebrated benchmarks. We seek to quantify how well LLM medical question-answering benchmark performance generalizes when benchmark assumptions are violated. Specifically, we present an adversarial method that we call MedFuzz (for medical fuzzing). MedFuzz attempts to modify benchmark questions in ways aimed at confounding the LLM. We demonstrate the approach by targeting strong assumptions about patient characteristics presented in the MedQA benchmark. Successful "attacks" modify a benchmark item in ways that would be unlikely to fool a medical expert but nonetheless "trick" the LLM into changing from a correct to an incorrect answer. Further, we present a permutation test technique that can ensure a successful attack is statistically significant. We show how to use performance on a "MedFuzzed" benchmark, as well as individual successful attacks. The methods show promise at providing insights into the ability of an LLM to operate robustly in more realistic settings.</description>

      <title>Towards Transparency: Exploring LLM Trainings Datasets through Visual Topic Modeling and Semantic Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs are now responsible for making many decisions on behalf of humans: from answering questions to classifying things, they have become an important part of everyday life. While computation and model architecture have been rapidly expanding in recent years, the efforts towards curating training datasets are still in their beginnings. This underappreciation of training datasets has led LLMs to create biased and low-quality content. In order to solve that issue, we present Bunka, a software that leverages AI and Cognitive Science to improve the refinement of textual datasets. We show how Topic Modeling coupled with 2-dimensional Cartography can increase the transparency of datasets. We then show how the same Topic Modeling techniques can be applied to Preferences datasets to accelerate the fine-tuning process and increase the capacities of the model on different benchmarks. Lastly, we show how using Frame Analysis can give insights into existing biases in the training corpus. Overall, we argue that we need better tools to explore and increase the quality and transparency of LLMs training datasets.</description>

      <title>Ask-EDA: A Design Assistant Empowered by LLM, Hybrid RAG and Abbreviation De-hallucination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic design engineers are challenged to find relevant information efficiently for a myriad of tasks within design construction, verification and technology development. Large language models (LLM) have the potential to help improve productivity by serving as conversational agents that effectively function as subject-matter experts. In this paper we demonstrate Ask-EDA, a chat agent designed to serve as a 24x7 expert available to provide guidance to design engineers. Ask-EDA leverages LLM, hybrid retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and abbreviation de-hallucination (ADH) techniques to deliver more relevant and accurate responses. We curated three evaluation datasets, namely q2a-100, cmds-100 and abbr-100. Each dataset is tailored to assess a distinct aspect: general design question answering, design command handling and abbreviation resolution. We demonstrated that hybrid RAG offers over a 40% improvement in Recall on the q2a-100 dataset and over a 60% improvement on the cmds-100 dataset compared to not using RAG, while ADH yields over a 70% enhancement in Recall on the abbr-100 dataset. The evaluation results show that Ask-EDA can effectively respond to design-related inquiries.</description>

      <title>OccamLLM: Fast and Exact Language Model Arithmetic in a Single Step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in text generation and reasoning, Large Language Models (LLMs) still face challenges in accurately performing complex arithmetic operations. To achieve accurate calculations, language model systems often enable LLMs to generate code for arithmetic operations. However, this approach compromises speed and security and, if finetuning is involved, risks the language model losing prior capabilities. We propose a framework that enables exact arithmetic in \textit{a single autoregressive step}, providing faster, more secure, and more interpretable LLM systems with arithmetic capabilities. We use the hidden states of an LLM to control a symbolic architecture which performs arithmetic. Our implementation using Llama 3 8B Instruct with OccamNet as a symbolic model (OccamLlama) achieves 100\% accuracy on single arithmetic operations ($+,-,\times,\div,\sin{},\cos{},\log{},\exp{},\sqrt{}$), outperforming GPT 4o and on par with GPT 4o using a code interpreter. OccamLlama also outperforms both Llama 3 8B Instruct and GPT 3.5 Turbo on multistep reasoning problems involving challenging arithmetic, thus enabling small LLMs to match the arithmetic performance of even much larger models. We will make our code public shortly.</description>

      <title>RAG-based Crowdsourcing Task Decomposition via Masked Contrastive Learning with Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crowdsourcing is a critical technology in social manufacturing, which leverages an extensive and boundless reservoir of human resources to handle a wide array of complex tasks. The successful execution of these complex tasks relies on task decomposition (TD) and allocation, with the former being a prerequisite for the latter. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs)-based methods have garnered significant attention. However, they are constrained to handling straightforward common-sense tasks due to their inherent restrictions involving limited and difficult-to-update knowledge as well as the presence of hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation-based crowdsourcing framework that reimagines TD as event detection from the perspective of natural language understanding. However, the existing detection methods fail to distinguish differences between event types and always depend on heuristic rules and external semantic analyzing tools. Therefore, we present a Prompt-Based Contrastive learning framework for TD (PBCT), which incorporates a prompt-based trigger detector to overcome dependence. Additionally, trigger-attentive sentinel and masked contrastive learning are introduced to provide varying attention to trigger and contextual features according to different event types. Experiment results demonstrate the competitiveness of our method in both supervised and zero-shot detection. A case study on printed circuit board manufacturing is showcased to validate its adaptability to unknown professional domains.</description>

      <title>SMS Spam Detection and Classification to Combat Abuse in Telephone Networks Using Natural Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the modern era, mobile phones have become ubiquitous, and Short Message Service (SMS) has grown to become a multi-million-dollar service due to the widespread adoption of mobile devices and the millions of people who use SMS daily. However, SMS spam has also become a pervasive problem that endangers users' privacy and security through phishing and fraud. Despite numerous spam filtering techniques, there is still a need for a more effective solution to address this problem [1]. This research addresses the pervasive issue of SMS spam, which poses threats to users' privacy and security. Despite existing spam filtering techniques, the high false-positive rate persists as a challenge. The study introduces a novel approach utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning models, particularly BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), for SMS spam detection and classification. Data preprocessing techniques, such as stop word removal and tokenization, are applied, along with feature extraction using BERT. Machine learning models, including SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest, are integrated with BERT for differentiating spam from ham messages. Evaluation results revealed that the Na\"ive Bayes classifier + BERT model achieves the highest accuracy at 97.31% with the fastest execution time of 0.3 seconds on the test dataset. This approach demonstrates a notable enhancement in spam detection efficiency and a low false-positive rate. The developed model presents a valuable solution to combat SMS spam, ensuring faster and more accurate detection. This model not only safeguards users' privacy but also assists network providers in effectively identifying and blocking SMS spam messages.</description>

      <title>From Redundancy to Relevance: Enhancing Explainability in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models have exploded with an endless variety, most of the popular Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) depend on sequential visual representation, where images are converted into hundreds or thousands of tokens before being input into the Large Language Model (LLM) along with language prompts. The black-box design hinders the interpretability of visual-language models, especially regarding more complex reasoning tasks. To explore the interaction process between image and text in complex reasoning tasks, we introduce the information flow method to visualize the interaction mechanism. By analyzing the dynamic flow of the information flow, we find that the information flow appears to converge in the shallow layer. Further investigation revealed a redundancy of the image token in the shallow layer. Consequently, a truncation strategy was introduced to aggregate image tokens within these shallow layers. This approach has been validated through experiments across multiple models, yielding consistent improvements.</description>

      <title>Break the Chain: Large Language Models Can be Shortcut Reasoners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning utilize complex modules but are hampered by high token consumption, limited applicability, and challenges in reproducibility. This paper conducts a critical evaluation of CoT prompting, extending beyond arithmetic to include complex logical and commonsense reasoning tasks, areas where standard CoT methods fall short. We propose the integration of human-like heuristics and shortcuts into language models (LMs) through "break the chain" strategies. These strategies disrupt traditional CoT processes using controlled variables to assess their efficacy. Additionally, we develop innovative zero-shot prompting strategies that encourage the use of shortcuts, enabling LMs to quickly exploit reasoning clues and bypass detailed procedural steps. Our comprehensive experiments across various LMs, both commercial and open-source, reveal that LMs maintain effective performance with "break the chain" strategies. We also introduce ShortcutQA, a dataset specifically designed to evaluate reasoning through shortcuts, compiled from competitive tests optimized for heuristic reasoning tasks such as forward/backward reasoning and simplification. Our analysis confirms that ShortcutQA not only poses a robust challenge to LMs but also serves as an essential benchmark for enhancing reasoning efficiency in AI.</description>

      <title>Set-Based Prompting: Provably Solving the Language Model Order Dependency Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of generative language models that can create long and coherent textual outputs via autoregression has lead to a proliferation of uses and a corresponding sweep of analyses as researches work to determine the limitations of this new paradigm. Unlike humans, these 'Large Language Models' (LLMs) are highly sensitive to small changes in their inputs, leading to unwanted inconsistency in their behavior. One problematic inconsistency when LLMs are used to answer multiple-choice questions or analyze multiple inputs is order dependency: the output of an LLM can (and often does) change significantly when sub-sequences are swapped, despite both orderings being semantically identical. In this paper we present , a technique that guarantees the output of an LLM will not have order dependence on a specified set of sub-sequences. We show that this method provably eliminates order dependency, and that it can be applied to any transformer-based LLM to enable text generation that is unaffected by re-orderings. Delving into the implications of our method, we show that, despite our inputs being out of distribution, the impact on expected accuracy is small, where the expectation is over the order of uniformly chosen shuffling of the candidate responses, and usually significantly less in practice. Thus, can be used as a 'dropped-in' method on fully trained models. Finally, we discuss how our method's success suggests that other strong guarantees can be obtained on LLM performance via modifying the input representations.</description>

      <title>Discrete Multimodal Transformers with a Pretrained Large Language Model for Mixed-Supervision Speech Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work on discrete speech tokenization has paved the way for models that can seamlessly perform multiple tasks across modalities, e.g., speech recognition, text to speech, speech to speech translation. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) pretrained from vast text corpora contain rich linguistic information that can improve accuracy in a variety of tasks. In this paper, we present a decoder-only Discrete Multimodal Language Model (DMLM), which can be flexibly applied to multiple tasks (ASR, T2S, S2TT, etc.) and modalities (text, speech, vision). We explore several critical aspects of discrete multi-modal models, including the loss function, weight initialization, mixed training supervision, and codebook. Our results show that DMLM benefits significantly, across multiple tasks and datasets, from a combination of supervised and unsupervised training. Moreover, for ASR, it benefits from initializing DMLM from a pretrained LLM, and from a codebook derived from Whisper activations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era increasingly influenced by artificial intelligence, the detection of fake news is crucial, especially in contexts like election seasons where misinformation can have significant societal impacts. This study evaluates the effectiveness of various LLMs in identifying and filtering fake news content. Utilizing a comparative analysis approach, we tested four large LLMs -- GPT-4, Claude 3 Sonnet, Gemini Pro 1.0, and Mistral Large -- and two smaller LLMs -- Gemma 7B and Mistral 7B. By using fake news dataset samples from Kaggle, this research not only sheds light on the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in fake news detection but also discusses the implications for developers and policymakers in enhancing AI-driven informational integrity.</description>

      <title>Bi-Chainer: Automated Large Language Models Reasoning with Bidirectional Chaining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown human-like reasoning abilities but still face challenges in solving complex logical problems. Existing unidirectional chaining methods, such as forward chaining and backward chaining, suffer from issues like low prediction accuracy and efficiency. To address these, we propose a bidirectional chaining method, Bi-Chainer, which dynamically switches to depth-first reasoning in the opposite reasoning direction when it encounters multiple branching options within the current direction. Thus, the intermediate reasoning results can be utilized as guidance to facilitate the reasoning process. We show that Bi-Chainer achieves sizable accuracy boots over unidirectional chaining frameworks on four challenging logical reasoning datasets. Moreover, Bi-Chainer enhances the accuracy of intermediate proof steps and reduces the average number of inference calls, resulting in more efficient and accurate reasoning.</description>

      <title>Exploring Human-AI Perception Alignment in Sensory Experiences: Do LLMs Understand Textile Hand?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) behaviour with human intent is critical for future AI. An important yet often overlooked aspect of this alignment is the perceptual alignment. Perceptual modalities like touch are more multifaceted and nuanced compared to other sensory modalities such as vision. This work investigates how well LLMs align with human touch experiences using the "textile hand" task. We created a "Guess What Textile" interaction in which participants were given two textile samples -- a target and a reference -- to handle. Without seeing them, participants described the differences between them to the LLM. Using these descriptions, the LLM attempted to identify the target textile by assessing similarity within its high-dimensional embedding space. Our results suggest that a degree of perceptual alignment exists, however varies significantly among different textile samples. For example, LLM predictions are well aligned for silk satin, but not for cotton denim. Moreover, participants didn't perceive their textile experiences closely matched by the LLM predictions. This is only the first exploration into perceptual alignment around touch, exemplified through textile hand. We discuss possible sources of this alignment variance, and how better human-AI perceptual alignment can benefit future everyday tasks.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Emergent Symbolic Reasoning Abilities of Llama Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance in a wide range of tasks, even if they are often trained with the only objective of chatting fluently with users. Among other skills, LLMs show emergent abilities in mathematical reasoning benchmarks, which can be elicited with appropriate prompting methods. In this work, we systematically investigate the capabilities and limitations of popular open-source LLMs on different symbolic reasoning tasks. We evaluate three models of the Llama 2 family on two datasets that require solving mathematical formulas of varying degrees of difficulty. We test a generalist LLM (Llama 2 Chat) as well as two fine-tuned versions of Llama 2 (MAmmoTH and MetaMath) specifically designed to tackle mathematical problems. We observe that both increasing the scale of the model and fine-tuning it on relevant tasks lead to significant performance gains. Furthermore, using fine-grained evaluation measures, we find that such performance gains are mostly observed with mathematical formulas of low complexity, which nevertheless often remain challenging even for the largest fine-tuned models.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a comprehensive error typology specifically designed for evaluating two distinct tasks in machine-generated patent texts: claims-to-abstract generation, and the generation of the next claim given previous ones. We have also developed a benchmark, PatentEval, for systematically assessing language models in this context. Our study includes a comparative analysis, annotated by humans, of various models. These range from those specifically adapted during training for tasks within the patent domain to the latest general-purpose large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, we explored and evaluated some metrics to approximate human judgments in patent text evaluation, analyzing the extent to which these metrics align with expert assessments. These approaches provide valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of current language models in the specialized field of patent text generation.</description>

      <title>Are LLMs classical or nonmonotonic reasoners? Lessons from generics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent scholarship on reasoning in LLMs has supplied evidence of impressive performance and flexible adaptation to machine generated or human feedback. Nonmonotonic reasoning, crucial to human cognition for navigating the real world, remains a challenging, yet understudied task. In this work, we study nonmonotonic reasoning capabilities of seven state-of-the-art LLMs in one abstract and one commonsense reasoning task featuring generics, such as 'Birds fly', and exceptions, 'Penguins don't fly' (see Fig. 1). While LLMs exhibit reasoning patterns in accordance with human nonmonotonic reasoning abilities, they fail to maintain stable beliefs on truth conditions of generics at the addition of supporting examples ('Owls fly') or unrelated information ('Lions have manes'). Our findings highlight pitfalls in attributing human reasoning behaviours to LLMs, as well as assessing general capabilities, while consistent reasoning remains elusive.</description>

      <title>Exploring Multilingual Large Language Models for Enhanced TNM classification of Radiology Report in lung cancer staging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Structured radiology reports remains underdeveloped due to labor-intensive structuring and narrative-style reporting. Deep learning, particularly large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5, offers promise in automating the structuring of radiology reports in natural languages. However, although it has been reported that LLMs are less effective in languages other than English, their radiological performance has not been extensively studied. Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the accuracy of TNM classification based on radiology reports using GPT3.5-turbo (GPT3.5) and the utility of multilingual LLMs in both Japanese and English. Material and Methods: Utilizing GPT3.5, we developed a system to automatically generate TNM classifications from chest CT reports for lung cancer and evaluate its performance. We statistically analyzed the impact of providing full or partial TNM definitions in both languages using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model. Results: Highest accuracy was attained with full TNM definitions and radiology reports in English (M = 94%, N = 80%, T = 47%, and ALL = 36%). Providing definitions for each of the T, N, and M factors statistically improved their respective accuracies (T: odds ratio (OR) = 2.35, p &lt; 0.001; N: OR = 1.94, p &lt; 0.01; M: OR = 2.50, p &lt; 0.001). Japanese reports exhibited decreased N and M accuracies (N accuracy: OR = 0.74 and M accuracy: OR = 0.21).

      <title>Improve Mathematical Reasoning in Language Models by Automated Process Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex multi-step reasoning tasks, such as solving mathematical problems or generating code, remain a significant hurdle for even the most advanced large language models (LLMs). Verifying LLM outputs with an Outcome Reward Model (ORM) is a standard inference-time technique aimed at enhancing the reasoning performance of LLMs. However, this still proves insufficient for reasoning tasks with a lengthy or multi-hop reasoning chain, where the intermediate outcomes are neither properly rewarded nor penalized. Process supervision addresses this limitation by assigning intermediate rewards during the reasoning process. To date, the methods used to collect process supervision data have relied on either human annotation or per-step Monte Carlo estimation, both prohibitively expensive to scale, thus hindering the broad application of this technique. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer style Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm named \textit{OmegaPRM} for the efficient collection of high-quality process supervision data. This algorithm swiftly identifies the first error in the Chain of Thought (CoT) with binary search and balances the positive and negative examples, thereby ensuring both efficiency and quality. As a result, we are able to collect over 1.5 million process supervision annotations to train a Process Reward Model (PRM). Utilizing this fully automated process supervision alongside the weighted self-consistency algorithm, we have enhanced the instruction tuned Gemini Pro model's math reasoning performance, achieving a 69.4\% success rate on the MATH benchmark, a 36\% relative improvement from the 51\% base model performance. Additionally, the entire process operates without any human intervention, making our method both financially and computationally cost-effective compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Are Large Language Models the New Interface for Data Pipelines?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Language Model is a term that encompasses various types of models designed to understand and generate human communication. Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their ability to process text with human-like fluency and coherence, making them valuable for a wide range of data-related tasks fashioned as pipelines. The capabilities of LLMs in natural language understanding and generation, combined with their scalability, versatility, and state-of-the-art performance, enable innovative applications across various AI-related fields, including eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), and Knowledge Graphs (KG). Furthermore, we believe these models can extract valuable insights and make data-driven decisions at scale, a practice commonly referred to as Big Data Analytics (BDA). In this position paper, we provide some discussions in the direction of unlocking synergies among these technologies, which can lead to more powerful and intelligent AI solutions, driving improvements in data pipelines across a wide range of applications and domains integrating humans, computers, and knowledge.</description>

      <title>Qabas: An Open-Source Arabic Lexicographic Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Qabas, a novel open-source Arabic lexicon designed for NLP applications. The novelty of Qabas lies in its synthesis of 110 lexicons. Specifically, Qabas lexical entries (lemmas) are assembled by linking lemmas from 110 lexicons. Furthermore, Qabas lemmas are also linked to 12 morphologically annotated corpora (about 2M tokens), making it the first Arabic lexicon to be linked to lexicons and corpora. Qabas was developed semi-automatically, utilizing a mapping framework and a web-based tool. Compared with other lexicons, Qabas stands as the most extensive Arabic lexicon, encompassing about 58K lemmas (45K nominal lemmas, 12.5K verbal lemmas, and 473 functional-word lemmas). Qabas is open-source and accessible online at https://sina.birzeit.edu/qabas.</description>

      <title>Anna Karenina Strikes Again: Pre-Trained LLM Embeddings May Favor High-Performing Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised clustering of student responses to open-ended questions into behavioral and cognitive profiles using pre-trained LLM embeddings is an emerging technique, but little is known about how well this captures pedagogically meaningful information. We investigate this in the context of student responses to open-ended questions in biology, which were previously analyzed and clustered by experts into theory-driven Knowledge Profiles (KPs). Comparing these KPs to ones discovered by purely data-driven clustering techniques, we report poor discoverability of most KPs, except for the ones including the correct answers. We trace this "discoverability bias" to the representations of KPs in the pre-trained LLM embeddings space.</description>

      <title>A Human-in-the-Loop Approach to Improving Cross-Text Prosody Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-To-Speech (TTS) prosody transfer models can generate varied prosodic renditions, for the same text, by conditioning on a reference utterance. These models are trained with a reference that is identical to the target utterance. But when the reference utterance differs from the target text, as in cross-text prosody transfer, these models struggle to separate prosody from text, resulting in reduced perceived naturalness. To address this, we propose a Human-in-the-Loop (HitL) approach. HitL users adjust salient correlates of prosody to make the prosody more appropriate for the target text, while maintaining the overall reference prosodic effect. Human adjusted renditions maintain the reference prosody while being rated as more appropriate for the target text $57.8\%$ of the time. Our analysis suggests that limited user effort suffices for these improvements, and that closeness in the latent reference space is not a reliable prosodic similarity metric for the cross-text condition.</description>

      <title>Prototypical Reward Network for Data-Efficient RLHF</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reward model for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). Notably, collecting human feedback for RLHF can be resource-intensive and lead to scalability issues for LLMs and complex tasks. Our proposed framework Proto-RM leverages prototypical networks to enhance reward models under limited human feedback. By enabling stable and reliable structural learning from fewer samples, Proto-RM significantly enhances LLMs' adaptability and accuracy in interpreting human preferences. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that Proto-RM significantly improves the performance of reward models and LLMs in human feedback tasks, achieving comparable and usually better results than traditional methods, while requiring significantly less data. in data-limited scenarios. This research offers a promising direction for enhancing the efficiency of reward models and optimizing the fine-tuning of language models under restricted feedback conditions.</description>

      <title>The Prompt Report: A Systematic Survey of Prompting Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) systems are being increasingly deployed across all parts of industry and research settings. Developers and end users interact with these systems through the use of prompting or prompt engineering. While prompting is a widespread and highly researched concept, there exists conflicting terminology and a poor ontological understanding of what constitutes a prompt due to the area's nascency. This paper establishes a structured understanding of prompts, by assembling a taxonomy of prompting techniques and analyzing their use. We present a comprehensive vocabulary of 33 vocabulary terms, a taxonomy of 58 text-only prompting techniques, and 40 techniques for other modalities. We further present a meta-analysis of the entire literature on natural language prefix-prompting.</description>

      <title>Reinterpreting 'the Company a Word Keeps': Towards Explainable and Ontologically Grounded Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the relative success of large language models (LLMs) is not a reflection on the symbolic vs. subsymbolic debate but a reflection on employing a successful bottom-up strategy of a reverse engineering of language at scale. However, and due to their subsymbolic nature whatever knowledge these systems acquire about language will always be buried in millions of weights none of which is meaningful on its own, rendering such systems utterly unexplainable. Furthermore, and due to their stochastic nature, LLMs will often fail in making the correct inferences in various linguistic contexts that require reasoning in intensional, temporal, or modal contexts. To remedy these shortcomings we suggest employing the same successful bottom-up strategy employed in LLMs but in a symbolic setting, resulting in explainable, language-agnostic, and ontologically grounded language models.</description>

      <title>GameBench: Evaluating Strategic Reasoning Abilities of LLM Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable few-shot performance on many natural language understanding tasks. Despite several demonstrations of using large language models in complex, strategic scenarios, there lacks a comprehensive framework for evaluating agents' performance across various types of reasoning found in games. To address this gap, we introduce GameBench, a cross-domain benchmark for evaluating strategic reasoning abilities of LLM agents. We focus on 9 different game environments, where each covers at least one axis of key reasoning skill identified in strategy games, and select games for which strategy explanations are unlikely to form a significant portion of models' pretraining corpuses. Our evaluations use GPT-3 and GPT-4 in their base form along with two scaffolding frameworks designed to enhance strategic reasoning ability: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and Reasoning Via Planning (RAP). Our results show that none of the tested models match human performance, and at worse GPT-4 performs worse than random action. CoT and RAP both improve scores but not comparable to human levels.</description>

      <title>Language Guided Skill Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skill discovery methods enable agents to learn diverse emergent behaviors without explicit rewards. To make learned skills useful for unknown downstream tasks, obtaining a semantically diverse repertoire of skills is essential. While some approaches introduce a discriminator to distinguish skills and others aim to increase state coverage, no existing work directly addresses the "semantic diversity" of skills. We hypothesize that leveraging the semantic knowledge of large language models (LLMs) can lead us to improve semantic diversity of resulting behaviors. In this sense, we introduce Language Guided Skill Discovery (LGSD), a skill discovery framework that aims to directly maximize the semantic diversity between skills. LGSD takes user prompts as input and outputs a set of semantically distinctive skills. The prompts serve as a means to constrain the search space into a semantically desired subspace, and the generated LLM outputs guide the agent to visit semantically diverse states within the subspace. We demonstrate that LGSD enables legged robots to visit different user-intended areas on a plane by simply changing the prompt. Furthermore, we show that language guidance aids in discovering more diverse skills compared to five existing skill discovery methods in robot-arm manipulation environments. Lastly, LGSD provides a simple way of utilizing learned skills via natural language.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has dramatically reshaped our interaction with digital technologies, ushering in an era where advancements in AI algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs) have natural language processing (NLP) systems like ChatGPT. This study delves into the impact of cutting-edge LLMs, notably OpenAI's ChatGPT, on medical diagnostics, with a keen focus on the dental sector. Leveraging publicly accessible datasets, these models augment the diagnostic capabilities of medical professionals, streamline communication between patients and healthcare providers, and enhance the efficiency of clinical procedures. The advent of ChatGPT-4 is poised to make substantial inroads into dental practices, especially in the realm of oral surgery. This paper sheds light on the current landscape and explores potential future research directions in the burgeoning field of LLMs, offering valuable insights for both practitioners and developers. Furthermore, it critically assesses the broad implications and challenges within various sectors, including academia and healthcare, thus mapping out an overview of AI's role in transforming dental diagnostics for enhanced patient care.</description>

      <title>LinkQ: An LLM-Assisted Visual Interface for Knowledge Graph Question-Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LinkQ, a system that leverages a large language model (LLM) to facilitate knowledge graph (KG) query construction through natural language question-answering. Traditional approaches often require detailed knowledge of complex graph querying languages, limiting the ability for users -- even experts -- to acquire valuable insights from KG data. LinkQ simplifies this process by first interpreting a user's question, then converting it into a well-formed KG query. By using the LLM to construct a query instead of directly answering the user's question, LinkQ guards against the LLM hallucinating or generating false, erroneous information. By integrating an LLM into LinkQ, users are able to conduct both exploratory and confirmatory data analysis, with the LLM helping to iteratively refine open-ended questions into precise ones. To demonstrate the efficacy of LinkQ, we conducted a qualitative study with five KG practitioners and distill their feedback. Our results indicate that practitioners find LinkQ effective for KG question-answering, and desire future LLM-assisted systems for the exploratory analysis of graph databases.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Tuning: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although safely enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tackling various complex tasks in a zero-shot manner, they remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks, particularly the unknown jailbreak attack. To enhance LLMs' generalized defense capabilities, we propose a two-stage adversarial tuning framework, which generates adversarial prompts to explore worst-case scenarios by optimizing datasets containing pairs of adversarial prompts and their safe responses. In the first stage, we introduce the hierarchical meta-universal adversarial prompt learning to efficiently and effectively generate token-level adversarial prompts. In the second stage, we propose the automatic adversarial prompt learning to iteratively refine semantic-level adversarial prompts, further enhancing LLM's defense capabilities. We conducted comprehensive experiments on three widely used jailbreak datasets, comparing our framework with six defense baselines under five representative attack scenarios. The results underscore the superiority of our proposed methods. Furthermore, our adversarial tuning framework exhibits empirical generalizability across various attack strategies and target LLMs, highlighting its potential as a transferable defense mechanism.</description>

Abstract: We employ a Large Language Model (LLM) to convert unstructured psychological interviews into structured questionnaires spanning various psychiatric and personality domains. The LLM is prompted to answer these questionnaires by impersonating the interviewee. The obtained answers are coded as features, which are used to predict standardized psychiatric measures of depression (PHQ-8) and PTSD (PCL-C), using a Random Forest regressor. Our approach is shown to enhance diagnostic accuracy compared to multiple baselines. It thus establishes a novel framework for interpreting unstructured psychological interviews, bridging the gap between narrative-driven and data-driven approaches for mental health assessment.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Impact of Economic and Social Factors on Energy Demand through Natural Language Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between energy demand and variables such as economic activity and weather is well established. However, this paper aims to explore the connection between energy demand and other social aspects, which receive little attention. Through the use of natural language processing on a large news corpus, we shed light on this important link. This study was carried out in five regions of the UK and Ireland and considers multiple horizons from 1 to 30 days. It also considers economic variables such as GDP, unemployment and inflation. We found that: 1) News about military conflicts, transportation, the global pandemic, regional economics, and the international energy market are related to electricity demand. 2) Economic indicators are more important in the East Midlands and Northern Ireland, while social indicators are more useful in the West Midlands and the South West of England. 3) The use of these indices improved forecasting performance by up to 9%.</description>

      <title>SignBLEU: Automatic Evaluation of Multi-channel Sign Language Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sign languages are multi-channel languages that communicate information through not just the hands (manual signals) but also facial expressions and upper body movements (non-manual signals). However, since automatic sign language translation is usually performed by generating a single sequence of glosses, researchers eschew non-manual and co-occurring manual signals in favor of a simplified list of manual glosses. This can lead to significant information loss and ambiguity. In this paper, we introduce a new task named multi-channel sign language translation (MCSLT) and present a novel metric, SignBLEU, designed to capture multiple signal channels. We validated SignBLEU on a system-level task using three sign language corpora with varied linguistic structures and transcription methodologies and examined its correlation with human judgment through two segment-level tasks. We found that SignBLEU consistently correlates better with human judgment than competing metrics. To facilitate further MCSLT research, we report benchmark scores for the three sign language corpora and release the source code for SignBLEU at https://github.com/eq4all-projects/SignBLEU.</description>

      <title>Harnessing AI for efficient analysis of complex policy documents: a case study of Executive Order 14110</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy documents, such as legislation, regulations, and executive orders, are crucial in shaping society. However, their length and complexity make interpretation and application challenging and time-consuming. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), has the potential to automate the process of analyzing these documents, improving accuracy and efficiency. This study aims to evaluate the potential of AI in streamlining policy analysis and to identify the strengths and limitations of current AI approaches. The research focuses on question answering and tasks involving content extraction from policy documents. A case study was conducted using Executive Order 14110 on "Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence" as a test case. Four commercial AI systems were used to analyze the document and answer a set of representative policy questions. The performance of the AI systems was compared to manual analysis conducted by human experts. The study found that two AI systems, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude 3 Opus, demonstrated significant potential for supporting policy analysis, providing accurate and reliable information extraction from complex documents. They performed comparably to human analysts but with significantly higher efficiency. However, achieving reproducibility remains a challenge, necessitating further research and development.</description>

      <title>Enrolment-based personalisation for improving individual-level fairness in speech emotion recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expression of emotion is highly individualistic. However, contemporary speech emotion recognition (SER) systems typically rely on population-level models that adopt a `one-size-fits-all' approach for predicting emotion. Moreover, standard evaluation practices measure performance also on the population level, thus failing to characterise how models work across different speakers. In the present contribution, we present a new method for capitalising on individual differences to adapt an SER model to each new speaker using a minimal set of enrolment utterances. In addition, we present novel evaluation schemes for measuring fairness across different speakers. Our findings show that aggregated evaluation metrics may obfuscate fairness issues on the individual-level, which are uncovered by our evaluation, and that our proposed method can improve performance both in aggregated and disaggregated terms.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning and Fine-Tuning GPT for Argument Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in NLP and deep learning. In-Context Learning (ICL) has been suggested as a bridging paradigm between the training-free and fine-tuning LLMs settings. In ICL, an LLM is conditioned to solve tasks by means of a few solved demonstration examples included as prompt. Argument Mining (AM) aims to extract the complex argumentative structure of a text, and Argument Type Classification (ATC) is an essential sub-task of AM. We introduce an ICL strategy for ATC combining kNN-based examples selection and majority vote ensembling. In the training-free ICL setting, we show that GPT-4 is able to leverage relevant information from only a few demonstration examples and achieve very competitive classification accuracy on ATC. We further set up a fine-tuning strategy incorporating well-crafted structural features given directly in textual form. In this setting, GPT-3.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on ATC. Overall, these results emphasize the emergent ability of LLMs to grasp global discursive flow in raw text in both off-the-shelf and fine-tuned setups.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Knowledge-free Weak Supervision in Clinical Natural Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of deep learning-based natural language processing systems is based on large amounts of labeled training data which, in the clinical domain, are not easily available or affordable. Weak supervision and in-context learning offer partial solutions to this issue, particularly using large language models (LLMs), but their performance still trails traditional supervised methods with moderate amounts of gold-standard data. In particular, inferencing with LLMs is computationally heavy. We propose an approach leveraging fine-tuning LLMs and weak supervision with virtually no domain knowledge that still achieves consistently dominant performance. Using a prompt-based approach, the LLM is used to generate weakly-labeled data for training a downstream BERT model. The weakly supervised model is then further fine-tuned on small amounts of gold standard data. We evaluate this approach using Llama2 on three different n2c2 datasets. With no more than 10 gold standard notes, our final BERT models weakly supervised by fine-tuned Llama2-13B consistently outperformed out-of-the-box PubMedBERT by 4.7% to 47.9% in F1 scores. With only 50 gold standard notes, our models achieved close performance to fully fine-tuned systems.</description>

      <title>Scaling the Vocabulary of Non-autoregressive Models for Efficient Generative Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Retrieval introduces a new approach to Information Retrieval by reframing it as a constrained generation task, leveraging recent advancements in Autoregressive (AR) language models. However, AR-based Generative Retrieval methods suffer from high inference latency and cost compared to traditional dense retrieval techniques, limiting their practical applicability. This paper investigates fully Non-autoregressive (NAR) language models as a more efficient alternative for generative retrieval. While standard NAR models alleviate latency and cost concerns, they exhibit a significant drop in retrieval performance (compared to AR models) due to their inability to capture dependencies between target tokens. To address this, we question the conventional choice of limiting the target token space to solely words or sub-words. We propose PIXAR, a novel approach that expands the target vocabulary of NAR models to include multi-word entities and common phrases (up to 5 million tokens), thereby reducing token dependencies. PIXAR employs inference optimization strategies to maintain low inference latency despite the significantly larger vocabulary. Our results demonstrate that PIXAR achieves a relative improvement of 31.0% in MRR@10 on MS MARCO and 23.2% in Hits@5 on Natural Questions compared to standard NAR models with similar latency and cost. Furthermore, online A/B experiments on a large commercial search engine show that PIXAR increases ad clicks by 5.08% and revenue by 4.02%.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Zero-Shot Long-Context LLM Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the effectiveness of zero-shot compression techniques on large language models (LLMs) under long-context. We identify the tendency for computational errors to increase under long-context when employing certain compression methods. We propose a hypothesis to explain the varied behavior of different LLM compression techniques and explore remedies to mitigate the performance decline observed in some techniques under long-context. This is a course report for COS 598D Machine Learning and Systems by Prof. Kai Li at Princeton University. Due to limited computational resources, our experiments were conducted only on LLaMA-2-7B-32K.</description>

      <title>AGB-DE: A Corpus for the Automated Legal Assessment of Clauses in German Consumer Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legal tasks and datasets are often used as benchmarks for the capabilities of language models. However, openly available annotated datasets are rare. In this paper, we introduce AGB-DE, a corpus of 3,764 clauses from German consumer contracts that have been annotated and legally assessed by legal experts. Together with the data, we present a first baseline for the task of detecting potentially void clauses, comparing the performance of an SVM baseline with three fine-tuned open language models and the performance of GPT-3.5. Our results show the challenging nature of the task, with no approach exceeding an F1-score of 0.54. While the fine-tuned models often performed better with regard to precision, GPT-3.5 outperformed the other approaches with regard to recall. An analysis of the errors indicates that one of the main challenges could be the correct interpretation of complex clauses, rather than the decision boundaries of what is permissible and what is not.</description>

      <title>EAVE: Efficient Product Attribute Value Extraction via Lightweight Sparse-layer Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Product attribute value extraction involves identifying the specific values associated with various attributes from a product profile. While existing methods often prioritize the development of effective models to improve extraction performance, there has been limited emphasis on extraction efficiency. However, in real-world scenarios, products are typically associated with multiple attributes, necessitating multiple extractions to obtain all corresponding values. In this work, we propose an Efficient product Attribute Value Extraction (EAVE) approach via lightweight sparse-layer interaction. Specifically, we employ a heavy encoder to separately encode the product context and attribute. The resulting non-interacting heavy representations of the context can be cached and reused for all attributes. Additionally, we introduce a light encoder to jointly encode the context and the attribute, facilitating lightweight interactions between them. To enrich the interaction within the lightweight encoder, we design a sparse-layer interaction module to fuse the non-interacting heavy representation into the lightweight encoder. Comprehensive evaluation on two benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves significant efficiency gains with neutral or marginal loss in performance when the context is long and number of attributes is large. Our code is available \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EAVE-EA18}{here}.</description>

      <title>Silent Signals, Loud Impact: LLMs for Word-Sense Disambiguation of Coded Dog Whistles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dog whistle is a form of coded communication that carries a secondary meaning to specific audiences and is often weaponized for racial and socioeconomic discrimination. Dog whistling historically originated from United States politics, but in recent years has taken root in social media as a means of evading hate speech detection systems and maintaining plausible deniability. In this paper, we present an approach for word-sense disambiguation of dog whistles from standard speech using Large Language Models (LLMs), and leverage this technique to create a dataset of 16,550 high-confidence coded examples of dog whistles used in formal and informal communication. Silent Signals is the largest dataset of disambiguated dog whistle usage, created for applications in hate speech detection, neology, and political science.
  The dataset can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/SALT-NLP/silent_signals.</description>

      <title>Modeling language contact with the Iterated Learning Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contact between languages has the potential to transmit vocabulary and other language features; however, this does not always happen. Here, an iterated learning model is used to examine, in a simple way, the resistance of languages to change during language contact. Iterated learning models are agent-based models of language change, they demonstrate that languages that are expressive and compositional arise spontaneously as a consequence of a language transmission bottleneck. A recently introduced type of iterated learning model, the Semi-Supervised ILM is used to simulate language contact. These simulations do not include many of the complex factors involved in language contact and do not model a population of speakers; nonetheless the model demonstrates that the dynamics which lead languages in the model to spontaneously become expressive and compositional, also cause a language to maintain its core traits even after mixing with another language.</description>

      <title>PLUM: Preference Learning Plus Test Cases Yields Better Code Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction-finetuned code language models (LMs) have shown promise in various programming tasks. They are trained, using a language modeling objective, on natural language instructions and gold code snippet pairs. Recent evidence suggests that these models, never exposed to incorrect solutions during training, often struggle to distinguish between correct and incorrect solutions. This observation raises our inquiry: Can preference learning, which trains models to prefer correct solutions over incorrect ones, help push the boundaries of code LMs even further? We propose PLUM, a novel \textbf{p}reference \textbf{l}earning framework a\textbf{u}gmented with test cases tailored for code L\textbf{M}s.PLUM aims to investigate the key success factors and potential benefits of preference learning in code LMs, which remain elusive despite its success in aligning LMs with human values. PLUM consists of three stages: (1) Generating test cases for natural language instructions, (2) sampling candidate solutions from the policy and evaluating them against the test cases to create a preference dataset, which is then used to (3) train the policy with a preference learning algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that PLUM substantially improves the performance of existing code LMs on established code generation benchmarks such as HumanEval (+) and MBPP (+), even for the state-of-the-art open-source language model CodeQwen-1.5-7B-Chat. PLUM complements the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, demonstrating synergistic effects.</description>

      <title>SignMusketeers: An Efficient Multi-Stream Approach for Sign Language Translation at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A persistent challenge in sign language video processing, including the task of sign language to written language translation, is how we learn representations of sign language in an effective and efficient way that can preserve the important attributes of these languages, while remaining invariant to irrelevant visual differences. Informed by the nature and linguistics of signed languages, our proposed method focuses on just the most relevant parts in a signing video: the face, hands and body posture of the signer. However, instead of using pose estimation coordinates from off-the-shelf pose tracking models, which have inconsistent performance for hands and faces, we propose to learn the complex handshapes and rich facial expressions of sign languages in a self-supervised fashion. Our approach is based on learning from individual frames (rather than video sequences) and is therefore much more efficient than prior work on sign language pre-training. Compared to a recent model that established a new state of the art in sign language translation on the How2Sign dataset, our approach yields similar translation performance, using less than 3\% of the compute.</description>

      <title>Agent-SiMT: Agent-assisted Simultaneous Machine Translation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) generates target translations while reading the source sentence. It relies on a policy to determine the optimal timing for reading sentences and generating translations. Existing SiMT methods generally adopt the traditional Transformer architecture, which concurrently determines the policy and generates translations. While they excel at determining policies, their translation performance is suboptimal. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive corpora, possess superior generation capabilities, but it is difficult for them to acquire translation policy through the training methods of SiMT. Therefore, we introduce Agent-SiMT, a framework combining the strengths of LLMs and traditional SiMT methods. Agent-SiMT contains the policy-decision agent and the translation agent. The policy-decision agent is managed by a SiMT model, which determines the translation policy using partial source sentence and translation. The translation agent, leveraging an LLM, generates translation based on the partial source sentence. The two agents collaborate to accomplish SiMT. Experiments demonstrate that Agent-SiMT attains state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>A Non-autoregressive Generation Framework for End-to-End Simultaneous Speech-to-Any Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous translation models play a crucial role in facilitating communication. However, existing research primarily focuses on text-to-text or speech-to-text models, necessitating additional cascade components to achieve speech-to-speech translation. These pipeline methods suffer from error propagation and accumulate delays in each cascade component, resulting in reduced synchronization between the speaker and listener. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel non-autoregressive generation framework for simultaneous speech translation (NAST-S2X), which integrates speech-to-text and speech-to-speech tasks into a unified end-to-end framework. We develop a non-autoregressive decoder capable of concurrently generating multiple text or acoustic unit tokens upon receiving fixed-length speech chunks. The decoder can generate blank or repeated tokens and employ CTC decoding to dynamically adjust its latency. Experimental results show that NAST-S2X outperforms state-of-the-art models in both speech-to-text and speech-to-speech tasks. It achieves high-quality simultaneous interpretation within a delay of less than 3 seconds and provides a 28 times decoding speedup in offline generation.</description>

Abstract: Attributing answer text to its source document for information-seeking questions is crucial for building trustworthy, reliable, and accountable systems. We formulate a new task of post-hoc answer attribution for long document comprehension (LDC). Owing to the lack of long-form abstractive and information-seeking LDC datasets, we refactor existing datasets to assess the strengths and weaknesses of existing retrieval-based and proposed answer decomposition and textual entailment-based optimal selection attribution systems for this task. We throw light on the limitations of existing datasets and the need for datasets to assess the actual performance of systems on this task.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Framework for LLM Hallucination Detection via Belief Tree Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of hallucination detection, which aims to determine the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. To address this problem, a popular class of methods utilize the LLM's self-consistencies in its beliefs in a set of logically related augmented statements generated by the LLM, which does not require external knowledge databases and can work with both white-box and black-box LLMs. However, in many existing approaches, the augmented statements tend to be very monotone and unstructured, which makes it difficult to integrate meaningful information from the LLM beliefs in these statements. Also, many methods work with the binarized version of the LLM's belief, instead of the continuous version, which significantly loses information. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose Belief Tree Propagation (BTProp), a probabilistic framework for LLM hallucination detection. BTProp introduces a belief tree of logically related statements by recursively decomposing a parent statement into child statements with three decomposition strategies, and builds a hidden Markov tree model to integrate the LLM's belief scores in these statements in a principled way. Experiment results show that our method improves baselines by 3%-9% (evaluated by AUROC and AUC-PR) on multiple hallucination detection benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/BTProp.</description>

Abstract: Large language models have ushered in a new era of artificial intelligence research. However, their substantial training costs hinder further development and widespread adoption. In this paper, inspired by the redundancy in the parameters of large language models, we propose a novel training paradigm: Evolving Subnetwork Training (EST). EST samples subnetworks from the layers of the large language model and from commonly used modules within each layer, Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). By gradually increasing the size of the subnetworks during the training process, EST can save the cost of training. We apply EST to train GPT2 model and TinyLlama model, resulting in 26.7\% FLOPs saving for GPT2 and 25.0\% for TinyLlama without an increase in loss on the pre-training dataset. Moreover, EST leads to performance improvements in downstream tasks, indicating that it benefits generalization. Additionally, we provide intuitive theoretical studies based on training dynamics and Dropout theory to ensure the feasibility of EST.

      <title>Missingness-resilient Video-enhanced Multimodal Disfluency Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing speech disfluency detection techniques only rely upon acoustic data. In this work, we present a practical multimodal disfluency detection approach that leverages available video data together with audio. We curate an audiovisual dataset and propose a novel fusion technique with unified weight-sharing modality-agnostic encoders to learn the temporal and semantic context. Our resilient design accommodates real-world scenarios where the video modality may sometimes be missing during inference. We also present alternative fusion strategies when both modalities are assured to be complete. In experiments across five disfluency-detection tasks, our unified multimodal approach significantly outperforms Audio-only unimodal methods, yielding an average absolute improvement of 10% (i.e., 10 percentage point increase) when both video and audio modalities are always available, and 7% even when video modality is missing in half of the samples.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Boundary Ambiguity and Inherent Bias for Text Classification in the Era of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text classification is a crucial task encountered frequently in practical scenarios, yet it is still under-explored in the era of large language models (LLMs). This study shows that LLMs are vulnerable to changes in the number and arrangement of options in text classification. Our extensive empirical analyses reveal that the key bottleneck arises from ambiguous decision boundaries and inherent biases towards specific tokens and positions. To mitigate these issues, we make the first attempt and propose a novel two-stage classification framework for LLMs. Our approach is grounded in the empirical observation that pairwise comparisons can effectively alleviate boundary ambiguity and inherent bias. Specifically, we begin with a self-reduction technique to efficiently narrow down numerous options, which contributes to reduced decision space and a faster comparison process. Subsequently, pairwise contrastive comparisons are employed in a chain-of-thought manner to draw out nuances and distinguish confusable options, thus refining the ambiguous decision boundary. Extensive experiments on four datasets (Banking77, HWU64, LIU54, and Clinic150) verify the effectiveness of our framework. Furthermore, benefitting from our framework, various LLMs can achieve consistent improvements. Our code and data are available in \url{https://github.com/Chuge0335/PC-CoT}.</description>

      <title>Crayon: Customized On-Device LLM via Instant Adapter Blending and Edge-Server Hybrid Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The customization of large language models (LLMs) for user-specified tasks gets important. However, maintaining all the customized LLMs on cloud servers incurs substantial memory and computational overheads, and uploading user data can also lead to privacy concerns. On-device LLMs can offer a promising solution by mitigating these issues. Yet, the performance of on-device LLMs is inherently constrained by the limitations of small-scaled models. To overcome these restrictions, we first propose Crayon, a novel approach for on-device LLM customization. Crayon begins by constructing a pool of diverse base adapters, and then we instantly blend them into a customized adapter without extra training. In addition, we develop a device-server hybrid inference strategy, which deftly allocates more demanding queries or non-customized tasks to a larger, more capable LLM on a server. This ensures optimal performance without sacrificing the benefits of on-device customization. We carefully craft a novel benchmark from multiple question-answer datasets, and show the efficacy of our method in the LLM customization.</description>

      <title>Delving into ChatGPT usage in academic writing through excess vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate and revise text with human-level performance, and have been widely commercialized in systems like ChatGPT. These models come with clear limitations: they can produce inaccurate information, reinforce existing biases, and be easily misused. Yet, many scientists have been using them to assist their scholarly writing. How wide-spread is LLM usage in the academic literature currently? To answer this question, we use an unbiased, large-scale approach, free from any assumptions on academic LLM usage. We study vocabulary changes in 14 million PubMed abstracts from 2010-2024, and show how the appearance of LLMs led to an abrupt increase in the frequency of certain style words. Our analysis based on excess words usage suggests that at least 10% of 2024 abstracts were processed with LLMs. This lower bound differed across disciplines, countries, and journals, and was as high as 30% for some PubMed sub-corpora. We show that the appearance of LLM-based writing assistants has had an unprecedented impact in the scientific literature, surpassing the effect of major world events such as the Covid pandemic.</description>

      <title>Paying More Attention to Source Context: Mitigating Unfaithful Translations from Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have showcased impressive multilingual machine translation ability. However, unlike encoder-decoder style models, decoder-only LLMs lack an explicit alignment between source and target contexts. Analyzing contribution scores during generation processes revealed that LLMs can be biased towards previously generated tokens over corresponding source tokens, leading to unfaithful translations. To address this issue, we propose to encourage LLMs to pay more attention to the source context from both source and target perspectives in zeroshot prompting: 1) adjust source context attention weights; 2) suppress irrelevant target prefix influence; Additionally, we propose 3) avoiding over-reliance on the target prefix in instruction tuning. Experimental results from both human-collected unfaithfulness test sets focusing on LLM-generated unfaithful translations and general test sets, verify our methods' effectiveness across multiple language pairs. Further human evaluation shows our method's efficacy in reducing hallucinatory translations and facilitating faithful translation generation.</description>

      <title>CoEvol: Constructing Better Responses for Instruction Finetuning through Multi-Agent Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, instruction fine-tuning (IFT) on large language models (LLMs) has garnered considerable attention to enhance model performance on unseen tasks. Attempts have been made on automatic construction and effective selection for IFT data. However, we posit that previous methods have not fully harnessed the potential of LLMs for enhancing data quality. The responses within IFT data could be further enhanced by leveraging the capabilities of LLMs themselves. In this paper, we propose CoEvol, an LLM-based multi-agent cooperation framework for the improvement of responses to instructions. To effectively refine the responses, we develop an iterative framework following a debate-advise-edit-judge paradigm. A two-stage multi-agent debate strategy is further devised to ensure the diversity and reliability of editing suggestions within the framework. Empirically, models equipped with CoEvol outperform competitive baselines evaluated by MT-Bench and AlpacaEval, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing instruction-following capabilities for LLMs.</description>

      <title>Effectively Compress KV Heads for LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized various natural language processing tasks. These models predominantly employ an auto-regressive decoding mechanism that utilizes Key-Value (KV) caches to eliminate redundant calculations for previous tokens. Nevertheless, as context lengths and batch sizes increase, the linear expansion in memory footprint of KV caches becomes a key bottleneck of LLM deployment, which decreases generation speeds significantly. To mitigate this issue, previous techniques like multi-query attention (MQA) and grouped-query attention (GQA) have been developed, in order to reduce KV heads to accelerate inference with comparable accuracy to multi-head attention (MHA). Despite their effectiveness, existing strategies for compressing MHA often overlook the intrinsic properties of the KV caches. In this work, we explore the low-rank characteristics of the KV caches and propose a novel approach for compressing KV heads. In particular, we carefully optimize the MHA-to-GQA transformation to minimize compression error, and to remain compatible with rotary position embeddings (RoPE), we also introduce specialized strategies for key caches with RoPE. We demonstrate that our method can compress half or even three-quarters of KV heads while maintaining performance comparable to the original LLMs, which presents a promising direction for more efficient LLM deployment in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the superior capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, they still face significant trustworthiness challenges. Yet, current literature on the assessment of trustworthy MLLMs remains limited, lacking a holistic evaluation to offer thorough insights into future improvements. In this work, we establish MultiTrust, the first comprehensive and unified benchmark on the trustworthiness of MLLMs across five primary aspects: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. Our benchmark employs a rigorous evaluation strategy that addresses both multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts, encompassing 32 diverse tasks with self-curated datasets. Extensive experiments with 21 modern MLLMs reveal some previously unexplored trustworthiness issues and risks, highlighting the complexities introduced by the multimodality and underscoring the necessity for advanced methodologies to enhance their reliability. For instance, typical proprietary models still struggle with the perception of visually confusing images and are vulnerable to multimodal jailbreaking and adversarial attacks; MLLMs are more inclined to disclose privacy in text and reveal ideological and cultural biases even when paired with irrelevant images in inference, indicating that the multimodality amplifies the internal risks from base LLMs. Additionally, we release a scalable toolbox for standardized trustworthiness research, aiming to facilitate future advancements in this important field.

      <title>Reading Miscue Detection in Primary School through Automatic Speech Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic reading diagnosis systems can benefit both teachers for more efficient scoring of reading exercises and students for accessing reading exercises with feedback more easily. However, there are limited studies on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for child speech in languages other than English, and limited research on ASR-based reading diagnosis systems. This study investigates how efficiently state-of-the-art (SOTA) pretrained ASR models recognize Dutch native children speech and manage to detect reading miscues. We found that Hubert Large finetuned on Dutch speech achieves SOTA phoneme-level child speech recognition (PER at 23.1\%), while Whisper (Faster Whisper Large-v2) achieves SOTA word-level performance (WER at 9.8\%). Our findings suggest that Wav2Vec2 Large and Whisper are the two best ASR models for reading miscue detection. Specifically, Wav2Vec2 Large shows the highest recall at 0.83, whereas Whisper exhibits the highest precision at 0.52 and an F1 score of 0.52.</description>

      <title>HalluDial: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Automatic Dialogue-Level Hallucination Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), achieving remarkable performance across diverse tasks and enabling widespread real-world applications. However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, generating content that either conflicts with established knowledge or is unfaithful to the original sources. Existing hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on sentence- or passage-level hallucination detection, neglecting dialogue-level evaluation, hallucination localization, and rationale provision. They also predominantly target factuality hallucinations while underestimating faithfulness hallucinations, often relying on labor-intensive or non-specialized evaluators. To address these limitations, we propose HalluDial, the first comprehensive large-scale benchmark for automatic dialogue-level hallucination evaluation. HalluDial encompasses both spontaneous and induced hallucination scenarios, covering factuality and faithfulness hallucinations. The benchmark includes 4,094 dialogues with a total of 146,856 samples. Leveraging HalluDial, we conduct a comprehensive meta-evaluation of LLMs' hallucination evaluation capabilities in information-seeking dialogues and introduce a specialized judge language model, HalluJudge. The high data quality of HalluDial enables HalluJudge to achieve superior or competitive performance in hallucination evaluation, facilitating the automatic assessment of dialogue-level hallucinations in LLMs and providing valuable insights into this phenomenon. The dataset and the code are available at https://github.com/FlagOpen/HalluDial.</description>

      <title>DARA: Decomposition-Alignment-Reasoning Autonomous Language Agent for Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Answering Questions over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA) is key to well-functioning autonomous language agents in various real-life applications. To improve the neural-symbolic reasoning capabilities of language agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) in KGQA, we propose the DecompositionAlignment-Reasoning Agent (DARA) framework. DARA effectively parses questions into formal queries through a dual mechanism: high-level iterative task decomposition and low-level task grounding. Importantly, DARA can be efficiently trained with a small number of high-quality reasoning trajectories. Our experimental results demonstrate that DARA fine-tuned on LLMs (e.g. Llama-2-7B, Mistral) outperforms both in-context learning-based agents with GPT-4 and alternative fine-tuned agents, across different benchmarks in zero-shot evaluation, making such models more accessible for real-life applications. We also show that DARA attains performance comparable to state-of-the-art enumerating-and-ranking-based methods for KGQA.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Exploring Large Language Models for Document-Level Machine Translation with In-context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit outstanding performance in machine translation via in-context learning. In contrast to sentence-level translation, document-level translation (DOCMT) by LLMs based on in-context learning faces two major challenges: firstly, document translations generated by LLMs are often incoherent; secondly, the length of demonstration for in-context learning is usually limited. To address these issues, we propose a Context-Aware Prompting method (CAP), which enables LLMs to generate more accurate, cohesive, and coherent translations via in-context learning. CAP takes into account multi-level attention, selects the most relevant sentences to the current one as context, and then generates a summary from these collected sentences. Subsequently, sentences most similar to the summary are retrieved from the datastore as demonstrations, which effectively guide LLMs in generating cohesive and coherent translations. We conduct extensive experiments across various DOCMT tasks, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in zero pronoun translation (ZPT) and literary translation tasks.</description>

      <title>Advancing Tool-Augmented Large Language Models: Integrating Insights from Errors in Inference Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverage tools, often in the form of APIs, to enhance their reasoning capabilities on complex tasks, thus taking on the role of intelligent agents interacting with the real world. The recently introduced ToolLLaMA model by Qin et al. [2024] utilizes the depth-first search-based decision tree (DFSDT) method for reasoning with $16000+$ real-world APIs, which effectively improves the planning and inferencing performance of tool-augmented LLMs compared to traditional chain reasoning approaches. However, their approach only employs successful paths from decision trees (also called inference trees) for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) during training, which does not fully exploit the advantages of the tree of thought. In this study, we propose an inference trajectory optimization framework based on the preference data extracted from decision trees to address this limitation. We first introduce a novel method for constructing preference data from the tree of thought, capitalizing on the failed explorations previously overlooked in the trees. Specifically, we generate an effective step-wise preference dataset, named ToolPreference, for tool use based on the ToolBench dataset. In the subsequent training phase, we first fine-tune the LLM with tool-usage expert trajectories and then use these step-wise preference pairs for direct preference optimization (DPO) to update the policy of the LLM, resulting in our ToolPrefer-LLaMA (TP-LLaMA) model. Our experiments demonstrate that by obtaining insights from errors in inference trees, TP-LLaMA significantly outperforms the baselines across almost all test scenarios by a large margin and exhibits better generalization capabilities with unseen APIs. At the same time, TP-LLaMA has also demonstrated superior reasoning efficiency compared to the baselines, making it more suitable for complex tool-usage reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Never Miss A Beat: An Efficient Recipe for Context Window Extension of Large Language Models with Consistent "Middle" Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, many methods have been developed to extend the context length of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), but they often require fine-tuning at the target length ($\gg4K$) and struggle to effectively utilize information from the middle part of the context. To address these issues, we propose $\textbf{C}$ontinuity-$\textbf{R}$elativity ind$\textbf{E}$xing with g$\textbf{A}$ussian $\textbf{M}$iddle (CREAM), which interpolates positional encodings by manipulating position indices. Apart from being simple, CREAM is training-efficient: it only requires fine-tuning at the pre-trained context window (eg, Llama 2-4K) and can extend LLMs to a much longer target context length (eg, 256K). To ensure that the model focuses more on the information in the middle, we introduce a truncated Gaussian to encourage sampling from the middle part of the context during fine-tuning, thus alleviating the ``Lost-in-the-Middle'' problem faced by long-context LLMs. Experimental results show that CREAM successfully extends LLMs to the target length for both Base and Chat versions of $\texttt{Llama2-7B}$ with ``Never Miss A Beat''. Our code will be publicly available soon.</description>

      <title>Teaching Language Models to Self-Improve by Learning from Language Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intentions and values is crucial yet challenging. Current methods primarily rely on human preferences, which are costly and insufficient in capturing nuanced feedback expressed in natural language. In this paper, we present Self-Refinement Tuning (SRT), a method that leverages model feedback for alignment, thereby reducing reliance on human annotations. SRT uses a base language model (e.g., Tulu2) to generate initial responses, which are critiqued and refined by a more advanced model (e.g., GPT-4-Turbo). This process enables the base model to self-evaluate and improve its outputs, facilitating continuous learning. SRT further optimizes the model by learning from its self-generated feedback and refinements, creating a feedback loop that promotes model improvement. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that SRT significantly outperforms strong baselines across diverse tasks and model sizes. When applied to a 70B parameter model, SRT increases the win rate from 9.6\% to 25.8\% on the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, surpassing well-established systems such as GPT-4-0314, Claude 2, and Gemini. Our analysis highlights the crucial role of language feedback in the success of SRT, suggesting potential for further exploration in this direction.</description>

      <title>Merging Improves Self-Critique Against Jailbreak Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The robustness of large language models (LLMs) against adversarial manipulations, such as jailbreak attacks, remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose an approach that enhances the self-critique capability of the LLM and further fine-tunes it over sanitized synthetic data. This is done with the addition of an external critic model that can be merged with the original, thus bolstering self-critique capabilities and improving the robustness of the LLMs response to adversarial prompts. Our results demonstrate that the combination of merging and self-critique can reduce the attack success rate of adversaries significantly, thus offering a promising defense mechanism against jailbreak attacks.

      <title>Towards Human-AI Collaboration in Healthcare: Guided Deferral Systems with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present a valuable technology for various applications in healthcare, but their tendency to hallucinate introduces unacceptable uncertainty in critical decision-making situations. Human-AI collaboration (HAIC) can mitigate this uncertainty by combining human and AI strengths for better outcomes. This paper presents a novel guided deferral system that provides intelligent guidance when AI defers cases to human decision-makers. We leverage LLMs' verbalisation capabilities and internal states to create this system, demonstrating that fine-tuning smaller LLMs with data from larger models enhances performance while maintaining computational efficiency. A pilot study showcases the effectiveness of our deferral system.</description>

      <title>Improving Autoformalization using Type Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models show promise for autoformalization, the task of automatically translating natural language into formal languages. However, current autoformalization methods remain limited. The last reported state-of-the-art performance on the ProofNet formalization benchmark for the Lean proof assistant, achieved using Codex for Lean 3, only showed successful formalization of 16.1% of informal statements. Similarly, our evaluation of GPT-4o for Lean 4 only produces successful translations 34.9% of the time. Our analysis shows that the performance of these models is largely limited by their inability to generate formal statements that successfully type-check (i.e., are syntactically correct and consistent with types) - with a whopping 86.6% of GPT-4o errors starting from a type-check failure. In this work, we propose a method to fix this issue through decoding with type-check filtering, where we initially sample a diverse set of candidate formalizations for an informal statement, then use the Lean proof assistant to filter out candidates that do not type-check. Using GPT-4o as a base model, and combining our method with self-consistency, we obtain a +18.3% absolute increase in formalization accuracy, and achieve a new state-of-the-art of 53.2% on ProofNet with Lean 4.</description>

      <title>Improving Commonsense Bias Classification by Mitigating the Influence of Demographic Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding commonsense knowledge is crucial in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, the presence of demographic terms in commonsense knowledge poses a potential risk of compromising the performance of NLP models. This study aims to investigate and propose methods for enhancing the performance and effectiveness of a commonsense polarization classifier by mitigating the influence of demographic terms. Three methods are introduced in this paper: (1) hierarchical generalization of demographic terms (2) threshold-based augmentation and (3) integration of hierarchical generalization and threshold-based augmentation methods (IHTA). The first method involves replacing demographic terms with more general ones based on a term hierarchy ontology, aiming to mitigate the influence of specific terms. To address the limited bias-related information, the second method measures the polarization of demographic terms by comparing the changes in the model's predictions when these terms are masked versus unmasked. This method augments commonsense sentences containing terms with high polarization values by replacing their predicates with synonyms generated by ChatGPT. The third method combines the two approaches, starting with threshold-based augmentation followed by hierarchical generalization. The experiments show that the first method increases the accuracy over the baseline by 2.33%, and the second one by 0.96% over standard augmentation methods. The IHTA techniques yielded an 8.82% and 9.96% higher accuracy than threshold-based and standard augmentation methods, respectively.</description>

      <title>Decipherment-Aware Multilingual Learning in Jointly Trained Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The principle that governs unsupervised multilingual learning (UCL) in jointly trained language models (mBERT as a popular example) is still being debated. Many find it surprising that one can achieve UCL with multiple monolingual corpora. In this work, we anchor UCL in the context of language decipherment and show that the joint training methodology is a decipherment process pivotal for UCL. In a controlled setting, we investigate the effect of different decipherment settings on the multilingual learning performance and consolidate the existing opinions on the contributing factors to multilinguality. From an information-theoretic perspective we draw a limit to the UCL performance and demonstrate the importance of token alignment in challenging decipherment settings caused by differences in the data domain, language order and tokenization granularity. Lastly, we apply lexical alignment to mBERT and investigate the contribution of aligning different lexicon groups to downstream performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) enhanced by self-reflection have achieved promising performance on machine translation. The key idea is guiding LLMs to generate translation with human-like feedback. However, existing self-reflection methods lack effective feedback information, limiting the translation performance. To address this, we introduce a DUAL-REFLECT framework, leveraging the dual learning of translation tasks to provide effective feedback, thereby enhancing the models' self-reflective abilities and improving translation performance. The application of this method across various translation tasks has proven its effectiveness in improving translation accuracy and eliminating ambiguities, especially in translation tasks with low-resource language pairs.</description>

      <title>On the Hallucination in Simultaneous Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely known that hallucination is a critical issue in Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) due to the absence of source-side information. While many efforts have been made to enhance performance for SiMT, few of them attempt to understand and analyze hallucination in SiMT. Therefore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of hallucination in SiMT from two perspectives: understanding the distribution of hallucination words and the target-side context usage of them. Intensive experiments demonstrate some valuable findings and particularly show that it is possible to alleviate hallucination by decreasing the over usage of target-side information for SiMT.</description>

      <title>MBBQ: A Dataset for Cross-Lingual Comparison of Stereotypes in Generative LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) have been shown to exhibit harmful biases and stereotypes. While safety fine-tuning typically takes place in English, if at all, these models are being used by speakers of many different languages. There is existing evidence that the performance of these models is inconsistent across languages and that they discriminate based on demographic factors of the user. Motivated by this, we investigate whether the social stereotypes exhibited by LLMs differ as a function of the language used to prompt them, while controlling for cultural differences and task accuracy. To this end, we present MBBQ (Multilingual Bias Benchmark for Question-answering), a carefully curated version of the English BBQ dataset extended to Dutch, Spanish, and Turkish, which measures stereotypes commonly held across these languages. We further complement MBBQ with a parallel control dataset to measure task performance on the question-answering task independently of bias. Our results based on several open-source and proprietary LLMs confirm that some non-English languages suffer from bias more than English, even when controlling for cultural shifts. Moreover, we observe significant cross-lingual differences in bias behaviour for all except the most accurate models. With the release of MBBQ, we hope to encourage further research on bias in multilingual settings. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/Veranep/MBBQ.</description>

Abstract: We provide an overview of the emergence of large language models for scientific computing applications. We highlight use cases that involve natural language processing of scientific documents and specialized languages designed to describe physical systems. For the former, chatbot style applications appear in medicine, mathematics and physics and can be used iteratively with domain experts for problem solving. We also review specialized languages within molecular biology, the languages of molecules, proteins, and DNA where language models are being used to predict properties and even create novel physical systems at much faster rates than traditional computing methods.</description>

      <title>Speaking Your Language: Spatial Relationships in Interpretable Emergent Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective communication requires the ability to refer to specific parts of an observation in relation to others. While emergent communication literature shows success in developing various language properties, no research has shown the emergence of such positional references. This paper demonstrates how agents can communicate about spatial relationships within their observations. The results indicate that agents can develop a language capable of expressing the relationships between parts of their observation, achieving over 90% accuracy when trained in a referential game which requires such communication. Using a collocation measure, we demonstrate how the agents create such references. This analysis suggests that agents use a mixture of non-compositional and compositional messages to convey spatial relationships. We also show that the emergent language is interpretable by humans. The translation accuracy is tested by communicating with the receiver agent, where the receiver achieves over 78% accuracy using parts of this lexicon, confirming that the interpretation of the emergent language was successful.</description>

      <title>Bilingual Sexism Classification: Fine-Tuned XLM-RoBERTa and GPT-3.5 Few-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sexism in online content is a pervasive issue that necessitates effective classification techniques to mitigate its harmful impact. Online platforms often have sexist comments and posts that create a hostile environment, especially for women and minority groups. This content not only spreads harmful stereotypes but also causes emotional harm. Reliable methods are essential to find and remove sexist content, making online spaces safer and more welcoming. Therefore, the sEXism Identification in Social neTworks (EXIST) challenge addresses this issue at CLEF 2024. This study aims to improve sexism identification in bilingual contexts (English and Spanish) by leveraging natural language processing models. The tasks are to determine whether a text is sexist and what the source intention behind it is. We fine-tuned the XLM-RoBERTa model and separately used GPT-3.5 with few-shot learning prompts to classify sexist content. The XLM-RoBERTa model exhibited robust performance in handling complex linguistic structures, while GPT-3.5's few-shot learning capability allowed for rapid adaptation to new data with minimal labeled examples. Our approach using XLM-RoBERTa achieved 4th place in the soft-soft evaluation of Task 1 (sexism identification). For Task 2 (source intention), we achieved 2nd place in the soft-soft evaluation.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning with HED-IT: The impact of human post-editing for dialogical language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic methods for generating and gathering linguistic data have proven effective for fine-tuning Language Models (LMs) in languages less resourced than English. Still, while there has been emphasis on data quantity, less attention has been given to its quality. In this work, we investigate the impact of human intervention on machine-generated data when fine-tuning dialogical models. In particular, we study (1) whether post-edited dialogues exhibit higher perceived quality compared to the originals that were automatically generated; (2) whether fine-tuning with post-edited dialogues results in noticeable differences in the generated outputs; and (3) whether post-edited dialogues influence the outcomes when considering the parameter size of the LMs. To this end we created HED-IT, a large-scale dataset where machine-generated dialogues are paired with the version post-edited by humans. Using both the edited and unedited portions of HED-IT, we fine-tuned three different sizes of an LM. Results from both human and automatic evaluation show that the different quality of training data is clearly perceived and it has an impact also on the models trained on such data. Additionally, our findings indicate that larger models are less sensitive to data quality, whereas this has a crucial impact on smaller models. These results enhance our comprehension of the impact of human intervention on training data in the development of high-quality LMs.</description>

      <title>Can We Achieve High-quality Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation without Parallel Speech Data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently proposed two-pass direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) models decompose the task into speech-to-text translation (S2TT) and text-to-speech (TTS) within an end-to-end model, yielding promising results. However, the training of these models still relies on parallel speech data, which is extremely challenging to collect. In contrast, S2TT and TTS have accumulated a large amount of data and pretrained models, which have not been fully utilized in the development of S2ST models. Inspired by this, in this paper, we first introduce a composite S2ST model named ComSpeech, which can seamlessly integrate any pretrained S2TT and TTS models into a direct S2ST model. Furthermore, to eliminate the reliance on parallel speech data, we propose a novel training method ComSpeech-ZS that solely utilizes S2TT and TTS data. It aligns representations in the latent space through contrastive learning, enabling the speech synthesis capability learned from the TTS data to generalize to S2ST in a zero-shot manner. Experimental results on the CVSS dataset show that when the parallel speech data is available, ComSpeech surpasses previous two-pass models like UnitY and Translatotron 2 in both translation quality and decoding speed. When there is no parallel speech data, ComSpeech-ZS lags behind \name by only 0.7 ASR-BLEU and outperforms the cascaded models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short feedback responses, such as backchannels, play an important role in spoken dialogue. So far, most of the modeling of feedback responses has focused on their timing, often neglecting how their lexical and prosodic form influence their contextual appropriateness and conversational function. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of embedding short dialogue contexts and feedback responses in the same representation space using a contrastive learning objective. In our evaluation, we primarily focus on how such embeddings can be used as a context-feedback appropriateness metric and thus for feedback response ranking in U.S. English dialogues. Our results show that the model outperforms humans given the same ranking task and that the learned embeddings carry information about the conversational function of feedback responses.</description>

      <title>BertaQA: How Much Do Language Models Know About Local Culture?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit extensive knowledge about the world, but most evaluations have been limited to global or anglocentric subjects. This raises the question of how well these models perform on topics relevant to other cultures, whose presence on the web is not that prominent. To address this gap, we introduce BertaQA, a multiple-choice trivia dataset that is parallel in English and Basque. The dataset consists of a local subset with questions pertinent to the Basque culture, and a global subset with questions of broader interest. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with local cultural knowledge, even as they excel on global topics. However, we show that continued pre-training in Basque significantly improves the models' performance on Basque culture, even when queried in English. To our knowledge, this is the first solid evidence of knowledge transfer from a low-resource to a high-resource language. Our analysis sheds light on the complex interplay between language and knowledge, and reveals that some prior findings do not fully hold when reassessed on local topics. Our dataset and evaluation code are available under open licenses at https://github.com/juletx/BertaQA.</description>

      <title>CTC-based Non-autoregressive Textless Speech-to-Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has achieved impressive translation quality, but it often faces the challenge of slow decoding due to the considerable length of speech sequences. Recently, some research has turned to non-autoregressive (NAR) models to expedite decoding, yet the translation quality typically lags behind autoregressive (AR) models significantly. In this paper, we investigate the performance of CTC-based NAR models in S2ST, as these models have shown impressive results in machine translation. Experimental results demonstrate that by combining pretraining, knowledge distillation, and advanced NAR training techniques such as glancing training and non-monotonic latent alignments, CTC-based NAR models achieve translation quality comparable to the AR model, while preserving up to 26.81$\times$ decoding speedup.</description>

      <title>Toxic Memes: A Survey of Computational Perspectives on the Detection and Explanation of Meme Toxicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet memes, channels for humor, social commentary, and cultural expression, are increasingly used to spread toxic messages. Studies on the computational analyses of toxic memes have significantly grown over the past five years, and the only three surveys on computational toxic meme analysis cover only work published until 2022, leading to inconsistent terminology and unexplored trends. Our work fills this gap by surveying content-based computational perspectives on toxic memes, and reviewing key developments until early 2024. Employing the PRISMA methodology, we systematically extend the previously considered papers, achieving a threefold result. First, we survey 119 new papers, analyzing 158 computational works focused on content-based toxic meme analysis. We identify over 30 datasets used in toxic meme analysis and examine their labeling systems. Second, after observing the existence of unclear definitions of meme toxicity in computational works, we introduce a new taxonomy for categorizing meme toxicity types. We also note an expansion in computational tasks beyond the simple binary classification of memes as toxic or non-toxic, indicating a shift towards achieving a nuanced comprehension of toxicity. Third, we identify three content-based dimensions of meme toxicity under automatic study: target, intent, and conveyance tactics. We develop a framework illustrating the relationships between these dimensions and meme toxicities. The survey analyzes key challenges and recent trends, such as enhanced cross-modal reasoning, integrating expert and cultural knowledge, the demand for automatic toxicity explanations, and handling meme toxicity in low-resource languages. Also, it notes the rising use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI for detecting and generating toxic memes. Finally, it proposes pathways for advancing toxic meme detection and interpretation.</description>

      <title>GLIMPSE: Pragmatically Informative Multi-Document Summarization for Scholarly Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific peer review is essential for the quality of academic publications. However, the increasing number of paper submissions to conferences has strained the reviewing process. This surge poses a burden on area chairs who have to carefully read an ever-growing volume of reviews and discern each reviewer's main arguments as part of their decision process. In this paper, we introduce \sys, a summarization method designed to offer a concise yet comprehensive overview of scholarly reviews. Unlike traditional consensus-based methods, \sys extracts both common and unique opinions from the reviews. We introduce novel uniqueness scores based on the Rational Speech Act framework to identify relevant sentences in the reviews. Our method aims to provide a pragmatic glimpse into all reviews, offering a balanced perspective on their opinions. Our experimental results with both automatic metrics and human evaluation show that \sys generates more discriminative summaries than baseline methods in terms of human evaluation while achieving comparable performance with these methods in terms of automatic metrics.</description>

      <title>BvSP: Broad-view Soft Prompting for Few-Shot Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aspect sentiment quad prediction (ASQP) aims to predict four aspect-based elements, including aspect term, opinion term, aspect category, and sentiment polarity. In practice, unseen aspects, due to distinct data distribution, impose many challenges for a trained neural model. Motivated by this, this work formulates ASQP into the few-shot scenario, which aims for fast adaptation in real applications. Therefore, we first construct a few-shot ASQP dataset (FSQP) that contains richer categories and is more balanced for the few-shot study. Moreover, recent methods extract quads through a generation paradigm, which involves converting the input sentence into a templated target sequence. However, they primarily focus on the utilization of a single template or the consideration of different template orders, thereby overlooking the correlations among various templates. To tackle this issue, we further propose a Broadview Soft Prompting (BvSP) method that aggregates multiple templates with a broader view by taking into account the correlation between the different templates. Specifically, BvSP uses the pre-trained language model to select the most relevant k templates with Jensen-Shannon divergence. BvSP further introduces soft prompts to guide the pre-trained language model using the selected templates. Then, we aggregate the results of multi-templates by voting mechanism. Empirical results demonstrate that BvSP significantly outperforms the stateof-the-art methods under four few-shot settings and other public datasets. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/byinhao/BvSP.</description>

      <title>When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/GATECH-EIC/Linearized-LLM.</description>

      <title>Limited Out-of-Context Knowledge Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as knowledge bases and significant in-context reasoning capabilities. However, previous work challenges their out-of-context reasoning ability, i.e., the ability to infer information from their training data, instead of from the context or prompt. This paper focuses on a significant facet of out-of-context reasoning: Out-of-Context Knowledge Reasoning (OCKR), which is to combine multiple knowledge to infer new knowledge. We designed a synthetic dataset with seven representative OCKR tasks to systematically assess the OCKR capabilities of LLMs. Using this dataset, we evaluated the LLaMA2-13B-chat model and discovered that its proficiency in this aspect is limited, regardless of whether the knowledge is trained in a separate or adjacent training settings. Moreover, training the model to reason with complete reasoning data did not result in significant improvement. Training the model to perform explicit knowledge retrieval helps in only one of the tasks, indicating that the model's limited OCKR capabilities are due to difficulties in retrieving relevant knowledge. Furthermore, we treat cross-lingual knowledge transfer as a distinct form of OCKR, and evaluate this ability. Our results show that the evaluated model also exhibits limited ability in transferring knowledge across languages. The dataset used in this study is available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/ID-OCKR.</description>

      <title>MINERS: Multilingual Language Models as Semantic Retrievers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Words have been represented in a high-dimensional vector space that encodes their semantic similarities, enabling downstream applications such as retrieving synonyms, antonyms, and relevant contexts. However, despite recent advances in multilingual language models (LMs), the effectiveness of these models' representations in semantic retrieval contexts has not been comprehensively explored. To fill this gap, this paper introduces the MINERS, a benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of multilingual LMs in semantic retrieval tasks, including bitext mining and classification via retrieval-augmented contexts. We create a comprehensive framework to assess the robustness of LMs in retrieving samples across over 200 diverse languages, including extremely low-resource languages in challenging cross-lingual and code-switching settings. Our results demonstrate that by solely retrieving semantically similar embeddings yields performance competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring any fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Learning Domain-Invariant Features for Out-of-Context News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal out-of-context news is a common type of misinformation on online media platforms. This involves posting a caption, alongside an invalid out-of-context news image. Reflecting its importance, researchers have developed models to detect such misinformation. However, a common limitation of these models is that they only consider the scenario where pre-labeled data is available for each domain, failing to address the out-of-context news detection on unlabeled domains (e.g., unverified news on new topics or agencies). In this work, we therefore focus on domain adaptive out-of-context news detection. In order to effectively adapt the detection model to unlabeled news topics or agencies, we propose ConDA-TTA (Contrastive Domain Adaptation with Test-Time Adaptation) which applies contrastive learning and maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to learn the domain-invariant feature. In addition, it leverages target domain statistics during test-time to further assist domain adaptation. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms baselines in 5 out of 7 domain adaptation settings on two public datasets, by as much as 2.93% in F1 and 2.08% in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Textual Similarity as a Key Metric in Machine Translation Quality Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) Quality Estimation (QE) assesses translation reliability without reference texts. This study introduces "textual similarity" as a new metric for QE, using sentence transformers and cosine similarity to measure semantic closeness. Analyzing data from the MLQE-PE dataset, we found that textual similarity exhibits stronger correlations with human scores than traditional metrics (hter, model evaluation etc.). Employing GAMMs as a statistical tool, we demonstrated that textual similarity consistently outperforms other metrics across multiple language pairs in predicting human scores. We also found that "hter" actually failed to predict human scores in QE. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of textual similarity as a robust QE metric, recommending its integration with other metrics into QE frameworks and MT system training for improved accuracy and usability.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of Document-Level Relation Extraction Models to Entity Name Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the demand for cross-sentence and large-scale relation extraction, document-level relation extraction (DocRE) has attracted increasing research interest. Despite the continuous improvement in performance, we find that existing DocRE models which initially perform well may make more mistakes when merely changing the entity names in the document, hindering the generalization to novel entity names. To this end, we systematically investigate the robustness of DocRE models to entity name variations in this work. We first propose a principled pipeline to generate entity-renamed documents by replacing the original entity names with names from Wikidata. By applying the pipeline to DocRED and Re-DocRED datasets, we construct two novel benchmarks named Env-DocRED and Env-Re-DocRED for robustness evaluation. Experimental results show that both three representative DocRE models and two in-context learned large language models consistently lack sufficient robustness to entity name variations, particularly on cross-sentence relation instances and documents with more entities. Finally, we propose an entity variation robust training method which not only improves the robustness of DocRE models but also enhances their understanding and reasoning capabilities. We further verify that the basic idea of this method can be effectively transferred to in-context learning for DocRE as well.</description>

Abstract: Recognizing a speaker's level of commitment to a belief is a difficult task; humans do not only interpret the meaning of the words in context, but also understand cues from intonation and other aspects of the audio signal. Many papers and corpora in the NLP community have approached the belief prediction task using text-only approaches. We are the first to frame and present results on the multimodal belief prediction task. We use the CB-Prosody corpus (CBP), containing aligned text and audio with speaker belief annotations. We first report baselines and significant features using acoustic-prosodic features and traditional machine learning methods. We then present text and audio baselines for the CBP corpus fine-tuning on BERT and Whisper respectively. Finally, we present our multimodal architecture which fine-tunes on BERT and Whisper and uses multiple fusion methods, improving on both modalities alone.</description>

      <title>Advancing Annotation of Stance in Social Media Posts: A Comparative Analysis of Large Language Models and Crowd Sourcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated text annotation in social media posts has garnered significant interest. Despite the impressive innovations in developing LLMs like ChatGPT, their efficacy, and accuracy as annotation tools are not well understood. In this paper, we analyze the performance of eight open-source and proprietary LLMs for annotating the stance expressed in social media posts, benchmarking their performance against human annotators' (i.e., crowd-sourced) judgments. Additionally, we investigate the conditions under which LLMs are likely to disagree with human judgment. A significant finding of our study is that the explicitness of text expressing a stance plays a critical role in how faithfully LLMs' stance judgments match humans'. We argue that LLMs perform well when human annotators do, and when LLMs fail, it often corresponds to situations in which human annotators struggle to reach an agreement. We conclude with recommendations for a comprehensive approach that combines the precision of human expertise with the scalability of LLM predictions. This study highlights the importance of improving the accuracy and comprehensiveness of automated stance detection, aiming to advance these technologies for more efficient and unbiased analysis of social media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negation is a common linguistic phenomenon. Yet language models face challenges with negation in many natural language understanding tasks such as question answering and natural language inference. In this paper, we experiment with seamless strategies that incorporate affirmative interpretations (i.e., paraphrases without negation) to make models more robust against negation. Crucially, our affirmative interpretations are obtained automatically. We show improvements with CondaQA, a large corpus requiring reasoning with negation, and five natural language understanding tasks.</description>

      <title>CADS: A Systematic Literature Review on the Challenges of Abstractive Dialogue Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstractive dialogue summarization is the task of distilling conversations into informative and concise summaries. Although reviews have been conducted on this topic, there is a lack of comprehensive work detailing the challenges of dialogue summarization, unifying the differing understanding of the task, and aligning proposed techniques, datasets, and evaluation metrics with the challenges. This article summarizes the research on Transformer-based abstractive summarization for English dialogues by systematically reviewing 1262 unique research papers published between 2019 and 2024, relying on the Semantic Scholar and DBLP databases. We cover the main challenges present in dialog summarization (i.e., language, structure, comprehension, speaker, salience, and factuality) and link them to corresponding techniques such as graph-based approaches, additional training tasks, and planning strategies, which typically overly rely on BART-based encoder-decoder models. We find that while some challenges, like language, have seen considerable progress, mainly due to training methods, others, such as comprehension, factuality, and salience, remain difficult and hold significant research opportunities. We investigate how these approaches are typically assessed, covering the datasets for the subdomains of dialogue (e.g., meeting, medical), the established automatic metrics and human evaluation approaches for assessing scores and annotator agreement. We observe that only a few datasets span across all subdomains. The ROUGE metric is the most used, while human evaluation is frequently reported without sufficient detail on inner-annotator agreement and annotation guidelines. Additionally, we discuss the possible implications of the recently explored large language models and conclude that despite a potential shift in relevance and difficulty, our described challenge taxonomy remains relevant.</description>

      <title>TextGrad: Automatic "Differentiation" via Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI is undergoing a paradigm shift, with breakthroughs achieved by systems orchestrating multiple large language models (LLMs) and other complex components. As a result, developing principled and automated optimization methods for compound AI systems is one of the most important new challenges. Neural networks faced a similar challenge in its early days until backpropagation and automatic differentiation transformed the field by making optimization turn-key. Inspired by this, we introduce TextGrad, a powerful framework performing automatic ``differentiation'' via text. TextGrad backpropagates textual feedback provided by LLMs to improve individual components of a compound AI system. In our framework, LLMs provide rich, general, natural language suggestions to optimize variables in computation graphs, ranging from code snippets to molecular structures. TextGrad follows PyTorch's syntax and abstraction and is flexible and easy-to-use. It works out-of-the-box for a variety of tasks, where the users only provide the objective function without tuning components or prompts of the framework. We showcase TextGrad's effectiveness and generality across a diverse range of applications, from question answering and molecule optimization to radiotherapy treatment planning. Without modifying the framework, TextGrad improves the zero-shot accuracy of GPT-4o in Google-Proof Question Answering from $51\%$ to $55\%$, yields $20\%$ relative performance gain in optimizing LeetCode-Hard coding problem solutions, improves prompts for reasoning, designs new druglike small molecules with desirable in silico binding, and designs radiation oncology treatment plans with high specificity. TextGrad lays a foundation to accelerate the development of the next-generation of AI systems.</description>

      <title>Just Because We Camp, Doesn't Mean We Should: The Ethics of Modelling Queer Voices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern voice cloning models claim to be able to capture a diverse range of voices. We test the ability of a typical pipeline to capture the style known colloquially as "gay voice" and notice a homogenisation effect: synthesised speech is rated as sounding significantly "less gay" (by LGBTQ+ participants) than its corresponding ground-truth for speakers with "gay voice", but ratings actually increase for control speakers. Loss of "gay voice" has implications for accessibility. We also find that for speakers with "gay voice", loss of "gay voice" corresponds to lower similarity ratings.
  However, we caution that improving the ability of such models to synthesise ``gay voice'' comes with a great number of risks. We use this pipeline as a starting point for a discussion on the ethics of modelling queer voices more broadly. Collecting "clean" queer data has safety and fairness ramifications, and the resulting technology may cause harms from mockery to death.</description>

      <title>THaLLE: Text Hyperlocally Augmented Large Language Extension -- Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed new capabilities and opportunities across the technological landscape. However, the practicality of very large LLMs is challenged by their high compute cost, which does not justify the benefits given their limited capability compared to humans. While smaller, more practical LLMs have shown potential in financial analysis, though they are not yet fully proficient, as evidenced by their near-passing performance on the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exam. In this work, we present Financial Analyst Extension to our Text Hyperlocally Augmented Large Language Extension (THaLLE), a series of 8B LLMs consistently achieving highest performance on mock CFA exams against models of comparable size. We thoroughly document the fine-tuning techniques used to facilitate future research. Additionally, we introduce the use of Flare CFA, a publicly available dataset for evaluating LLMs as a financial advisor.</description>

      <title>Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a long-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation complexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of benchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently extrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show improved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence model, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample implementation of Samba is publicly available in https://github.com/microsoft/Samba.</description>

      <title>Simple and Effective Masked Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, prior work reports a significant performance gap between diffusion and autoregressive (AR) methods in language modeling. In this work, we show that simple masked discrete diffusion is more performant than previously thought. We apply an effective training recipe that improves the performance of masked diffusion models and derive a simplified, Rao-Blackwellized objective that results in additional improvements. Our objective has a simple form -- it is a mixture of classical masked language modeling losses -- and can be used to train encoder-only language models that admit efficient samplers, including ones that can generate arbitrary lengths of text semi-autoregressively like a traditional language model. On language modeling benchmarks, a range of masked diffusion models trained with modern engineering practices achieves a new state-of-the-art among diffusion models, and approaches AR perplexity. We release our code at: https://github.com/kuleshov-group/mdlm</description>

      <title>Open-LLM-Leaderboard: From Multi-choice to Open-style Questions for LLMs Evaluation, Benchmark, and Arena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQ) are frequently used to assess large language models (LLMs). Typically, an LLM is given a question and selects the answer deemed most probable after adjustments for factors like length. Unfortunately, LLMs may inherently favor certain answer choice IDs, such as A/B/C/D, due to inherent biases of priori unbalanced probabilities, influencing the prediction of answers based on these IDs. Previous research has introduced methods to reduce this ''selection bias'' by simply permutating options on a few test samples and applying to new ones. Another problem of MCQ is the lottery ticket choice by ''random guessing''. The LLM does not learn particular knowledge, but the option is guessed correctly. This situation is especially serious for those small-scale LLMs. To address them, a more thorough approach involves shifting from MCQ to open-style questions, which can fundamentally eliminate selection bias and random guessing issues. However, transitioning causes its own set of challenges in (1) identifying suitable open-style questions and (2) validating the correctness of LLM open-style responses against human-annotated ground-truths. This work aims to tackle these significant difficulties, and establish a new LLM evaluation benchmark through entirely open-style questions. Consequently, we introduce the Open-LLM-Leaderboard to track various LLMs' performance and reflect true capability of them, such as GPT-4o/4/3.5, Claude 3, Gemini, etc. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/Open-LLM-Leaderboard.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold the potential to revolutionize autoformalization. The introduction of Lean4, a mathematical programming language, presents an unprecedented opportunity to rigorously assess the autoformalization capabilities of LLMs. This paper introduces a novel evaluation benchmark designed for Lean4, applying it to test the abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Gemini Pro. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that, despite recent advancements, these LLMs still exhibit limitations in autoformalization, particularly in more complex areas of mathematics. These findings underscore the need for further development in LLMs to fully harness their potential in scientific research and development. This study not only benchmarks current LLM capabilities but also sets the stage for future enhancements in autoformalization.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Large Language Model Training through Dynamic Parameter Adjustment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of large language models, the demand for efficient use of computational resources has become critically important. Although parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques have achieved results comparable to full fine-tuning, their application during the pre-training phase poses significant challenges. Specifically, employing parameter-efficient strategies at the onset of pre-training can severely compromise efficiency, especially in larger models. In this paper, building upon the fine-tuning method LoRA, we introduce a novel parameter-efficient training technique that frequently alters trainable part of parameters, facilitating effective pre-training. Our method not only achieves memory reductions and computational overhead comparable to current state-of-the-art parameter-efficient algorithms during the pre-training phase but also maintains accuracy levels comparable to those of full pre-training. We provide both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>DHA: Learning Decoupled-Head Attention from Transformer Checkpoints via Adaptive Heads Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters demonstrate impressive performance. However, the widely used Multi-Head Attention (MHA) in LLMs incurs substantial computational and memory costs during inference. While some efforts have optimized attention mechanisms by pruning heads or sharing parameters among heads, these methods often lead to performance degradation or necessitate substantial continued pre-training costs to restore performance. Based on the analysis of attention redundancy, we design a Decoupled-Head Attention (DHA) mechanism. DHA adaptively configures group sharing for key heads and value heads across various layers, achieving a better balance between performance and efficiency. Inspired by the observation of clustering similar heads, we propose to progressively transform the MHA checkpoint into the DHA model through linear fusion of similar head parameters step by step, retaining the parametric knowledge of the MHA checkpoint. We construct DHA models by transforming various scales of MHA checkpoints given target head budgets. Our experiments show that DHA remarkably requires a mere 0.25\% of the original model's pre-training budgets to achieve 97.6\% of performance while saving 75\% of KV cache. Compared to Group-Query Attention (GQA), DHA achieves a 5$\times$ training acceleration, a maximum of 13.93\% performance improvement under 0.01\% pre-training budget, and 4\% relative improvement under 0.05\% pre-training budget.</description>

      <title>LoRA-Whisper: Parameter-Efficient and Extensible Multilingual ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR), driven by the emergence of end-to-end (E2E) models and the scaling of multilingual datasets. Despite that, two main challenges persist in multilingual ASR: language interference and the incorporation of new languages without degrading the performance of the existing ones. This paper proposes LoRA-Whisper, which incorporates LoRA matrix into Whisper for multilingual ASR, effectively mitigating language interference. Furthermore, by leveraging LoRA and the similarities between languages, we can achieve better performance on new languages while upholding consistent performance on original ones. Experiments on a real-world task across eight languages demonstrate that our proposed LoRA-Whisper yields a relative gain of 18.5% and 23.0% over the baseline system for multilingual ASR and language expansion respectively.</description>

      <title>DualTime: A Dual-Adapter Multimodal Language Model for Time Series Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent rapid development of language models (LMs) has attracted attention in the field of time series, including multimodal time series modeling. However, we note that current time series multimodal methods are biased, often assigning a primary role to one modality while the other assumes a secondary role. They overlook the mutual benefits and complementary of different modalities. For example, in seizure diagnosis, relying solely on textual clinical reports makes it difficult to pinpoint the area and type of the disease, while electroencephalograms (EEGs) alone cannot provide an accurate diagnosis without considering the symptoms. In this study, based on the complementary information mining of time series multimodal data, we propose DualTime, a Dual-adapter multimodal language model for Time series representation implementing temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. By injecting lightweight adaption tokens, the LM pipeline shared by dual adapters encourages embedding alignment and achieves efficient fine-tuning. Empirically, our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both supervised and unsupervised settings, highlighting the complementary benefits of different modalities. In addition, we conduct few-shot label transfer experiments, which further verifies the transferability and expressiveness of our proposed DualTime.</description>

      <title>SecureNet: A Comparative Study of DeBERTa and Large Language Models for Phishing Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phishing, whether through email, SMS, or malicious websites, poses a major threat to organizations by using social engineering to trick users into revealing sensitive information. It not only compromises company's data security but also incurs significant financial losses. In this paper, we investigate whether the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged for particular task like text classification, particularly detecting malicious content and compare its results with state-of-the-art Deberta V3 (DeBERTa using ELECTRA-Style Pre-Training with Gradient-Disentangled Embedding Sharing) model. We systematically assess the potential and limitations of both approaches using comprehensive public datasets comprising diverse data sources such as email, HTML, URL, SMS, and synthetic data generation. Additionally, we demonstrate how LLMs can generate convincing phishing emails, making it harder to spot scams and evaluate the performance of both models in this context. Our study delves further into the challenges encountered by DeBERTa V3 during its training phases, fine-tuning methodology and transfer learning processes. Similarly, we examine the challenges associated with LLMs and assess their respective performance. Among our experimental approaches, the transformer-based DeBERTa method emerged as the most effective, achieving a test dataset (HuggingFace phishing dataset) recall (sensitivity) of 95.17% closely followed by GPT-4 providing a recall of 91.04%. We performed additional experiments with other datasets on the trained DeBERTa V3 model and LLMs like GPT 4 and Gemini 1.5. Based on our findings, we provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and robustness of these advanced language models, offering a detailed comparative analysis that can inform future research efforts in strengthening cybersecurity measures for detecting and mitigating phishing threats.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Query Generation using Large Language Models for Virtual Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual Assistants (VAs) are important Information Retrieval platforms that help users accomplish various tasks through spoken commands. The speech recognition system (speech-to-text) uses query priors, trained solely on text, to distinguish between phonetically confusing alternatives. Hence, the generation of synthetic queries that are similar to existing VA usage can greatly improve upon the VA's abilities -- especially for use-cases that do not (yet) occur in paired audio/text data.
  In this paper, we provide a preliminary exploration of the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic queries that are complementary to template-based methods. We investigate whether the methods (a) generate queries that are similar to randomly sampled, representative, and anonymized user queries from a popular VA, and (b) whether the generated queries are specific.
  We find that LLMs generate more verbose queries, compared to template-based methods, and reference aspects specific to the entity. The generated queries are similar to VA user queries, and are specific enough to retrieve the relevant entity. We conclude that queries generated by LLMs and templates are complementary.</description>

      <title>Raccoon: Prompt Extraction Benchmark of LLM-Integrated Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the proliferation of LLM-integrated applications such as GPT-s, millions are deployed, offering valuable services through proprietary instruction prompts. These systems, however, are prone to prompt extraction attacks through meticulously designed queries. To help mitigate this problem, we introduce the Raccoon benchmark which comprehensively evaluates a model's susceptibility to prompt extraction attacks. Our novel evaluation method assesses models under both defenseless and defended scenarios, employing a dual approach to evaluate the effectiveness of existing defenses and the resilience of the models. The benchmark encompasses 14 categories of prompt extraction attacks, with additional compounded attacks that closely mimic the strategies of potential attackers, alongside a diverse collection of defense templates. This array is, to our knowledge, the most extensive compilation of prompt theft attacks and defense mechanisms to date. Our findings highlight universal susceptibility to prompt theft in the absence of defenses, with OpenAI models demonstrating notable resilience when protected. This paper aims to establish a more systematic benchmark for assessing LLM robustness against prompt extraction attacks, offering insights into their causes and potential countermeasures. Resources of Raccoon are publicly available at https://github.com/M0gician/RaccoonBench.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing, albeit readily available as hardware or emulated on the cloud, is still far from being available in general regarding complex programming paradigms and learning curves. This vision paper introduces $Classi|Q\rangle$, a translation framework idea to bridge Classical and Quantum Computing by translating high-level programming languages, e.g., Python or C++, into a low-level language, e.g., Quantum Assembly. Our idea paper serves as a blueprint for ongoing efforts in quantum software engineering, offering a roadmap for further $Classi|Q\rangle$ development to meet the diverse needs of researchers and practitioners. $Classi|Q\rangle$ is designed to empower researchers and practitioners with no prior quantum experience to harness the potential of hybrid quantum computation. We also discuss future enhancements to $Classi|Q\rangle$, including support for additional quantum languages, improved optimization strategies, and integration with emerging quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>DISCOVERYWORLD: A Virtual Environment for Developing and Evaluating Automated Scientific Discovery Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated scientific discovery promises to accelerate progress across scientific domains. However, developing and evaluating an AI agent's capacity for end-to-end scientific reasoning is challenging as running real-world experiments is often prohibitively expensive or infeasible. In this work we introduce DISCOVERYWORLD, the first virtual environment for developing and benchmarking an agent's ability to perform complete cycles of novel scientific discovery. DISCOVERYWORLD contains a variety of different challenges, covering topics as diverse as radioisotope dating, rocket science, and proteomics, to encourage development of general discovery skills rather than task-specific solutions. DISCOVERYWORLD itself is an inexpensive, simulated, text-based environment (with optional 2D visual overlay). It includes 120 different challenge tasks, spanning eight topics each with three levels of difficulty and several parametric variations. Each task requires an agent to form hypotheses, design and run experiments, analyze results, and act on conclusions. DISCOVERYWORLD further provides three automatic metrics for evaluating performance, based on (a) task completion, (b) task-relevant actions taken, and (c) the discovered explanatory knowledge. We find that strong baseline agents, that perform well in prior published environments, struggle on most DISCOVERYWORLD tasks, suggesting that DISCOVERYWORLD captures some of the novel challenges of discovery, and thus that DISCOVERYWORLD may help accelerate near-term development and assessment of scientific discovery competency in agents.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) broaden their capabilities to manage thousands of API calls, they are confronted with complex data operations across vast datasets with significant overhead to the underlying system. In this work, we introduce LLM-dCache to optimize data accesses by treating cache operations as callable API functions exposed to the tool-augmented agent. We grant LLMs the autonomy to manage cache decisions via prompting, seamlessly integrating with existing function-calling mechanisms. Tested on an industry-scale massively parallel platform that spans hundreds of GPT endpoints and terabytes of imagery, our method improves Copilot times by an average of 1.24x across various LLMs and prompting techniques.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Backdoor Attacks and Defenses on Large Language Models: Implications for Security Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06852</link>

Abstract: The large language models (LLMs), which bridge the gap between human language understanding and complex problem-solving, achieve state-of-the-art performance on several NLP tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot settings. Despite the demonstrable efficacy of LMMs, due to constraints on computational resources, users have to engage with open-source language models or outsource the entire training process to third-party platforms. However, research has demonstrated that language models are susceptible to potential security vulnerabilities, particularly in backdoor attacks. Backdoor attacks are designed to introduce targeted vulnerabilities into language models by poisoning training samples or model weights, allowing attackers to manipulate model responses through malicious triggers. While existing surveys on backdoor attacks provide a comprehensive overview, they lack an in-depth examination of backdoor attacks specifically targeting LLMs. To bridge this gap and grasp the latest trends in the field, this paper presents a novel perspective on backdoor attacks for LLMs by focusing on fine-tuning methods. Specifically, we systematically classify backdoor attacks into three categories: full-parameter fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and attacks without fine-tuning. Based on insights from a substantial review, we also discuss crucial issues for future research on backdoor attacks, such as further exploring attack algorithms that do not require fine-tuning, or developing more covert attack algorithms.</description>

      <title>What's in an embedding? Would a rose by any embedding smell as sweet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often criticized for lacking true "understanding" and an ability to "reason" with their knowledge, being seen merely as advanced autocomplete systems. We believe that this perspective might be missing an important insight. We suggest that LLMs do develop a kind of empirical "understanding" that is "geometry"-like, which seems quite sufficient for a range of applications in NLP, computer vision, coding assistance, etc. However, this "geometric" understanding, built from incomplete and noisy data, makes them unreliable, difficult to generalize, and lacking in inference capabilities and explanations, similar to the challenges faced by heuristics-based expert systems decades ago.
  To overcome these limitations, we suggest that LLMs should be integrated with an "algebraic" representation of knowledge that includes symbolic AI elements used in expert systems. This integration aims to create large knowledge models (LKMs) that not only possess "deep" knowledge grounded in first principles, but also have the ability to reason and explain, mimicking human expert capabilities. To harness the full potential of generative AI safely and effectively, a paradigm shift from LLMs to the more comprehensive LKMs is needed.</description>

      <title>Bridging Language Gaps in Audio-Text Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-text retrieval is a challenging task, requiring the search for an audio clip or a text caption within a database. The predominant focus of existing research on English descriptions poses a limitation on the applicability of such models, given the abundance of non-English content in real-world data. To address these linguistic disparities, we propose a language enhancement (LE), using a multilingual text encoder (SONAR) to encode the text data with language-specific information. Additionally, we optimize the audio encoder through the application of consistent ensemble distillation (CED), enhancing support for variable-length audio-text retrieval. Our methodology excels in English audio-text retrieval, demonstrating state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on commonly used datasets such as AudioCaps and Clotho. Simultaneously, the approach exhibits proficiency in retrieving content in seven other languages with only 10% of additional language-enhanced training data, yielding promising results. The source code is publicly available https://github.com/zyyan4/ml-clap.</description>

      <title>MoreauPruner: Robust Pruning of Large Language Models against Weight Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-shot gradient methods have been extensively utilized in existing model pruning methods, where the model weights are regarded as static values and the effects of potential weight perturbations are not considered. However, the widely used large language models (LLMs) have several billion model parameters, which could increase the fragility of few-shot gradient pruning. In this work, we experimentally show that one-shot gradient pruning algorithms could lead to unstable results under perturbations to model weights. And the minor error of switching between data formats bfloat16 and float16 could result in drastically different outcomes. To address such instabilities, we leverage optimization analysis and propose an LLM structural pruning method, called MoreauPruner, with provable robustness against weight perturbations. In MoreauPruner, the model weight importance is estimated based on the neural network's Moreau envelope, which can be flexibly combined with $\ell_1$-norm regularization techniques to induce the sparsity required in the pruning task. We extensively evaluate the MoreauPruner algorithm on several well-known LLMs, including LLaMA-7B, LLaMA-13B, LLaMA3-8B, and Vicuna-7B. Our numerical results suggest the robustness of MoreauPruner against weight perturbations, and indicate the MoreauPruner's successful accuracy-based scores in comparison to several existing pruning methods. We have released the code in \url{https://github.com/ShiningSord/MoreauPruner}.</description>

      <title>Improving Multi-hop Logical Reasoning in Knowledge Graphs with Context-Aware Query Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-hop logical reasoning on knowledge graphs is a pivotal task in natural language processing, with numerous approaches aiming to answer First-Order Logic (FOL) queries. Recent geometry (e.g., box, cone) and probability (e.g., beta distribution)-based methodologies have effectively addressed complex FOL queries. However, a common challenge across these methods lies in determining accurate geometric bounds or probability parameters for these queries. The challenge arises because existing methods rely on linear sequential operations within their computation graphs, overlooking the logical structure of the query and the relation-induced information that can be gleaned from the relations of the query, which we call the context of the query. To address the problem, we propose a model-agnostic methodology that enhances the effectiveness of existing multi-hop logical reasoning approaches by fully integrating the context of the FOL query graph. Our approach distinctively discerns (1) the structural context inherent to the query structure and (2) the relation-induced context unique to each node in the query graph as delineated in the corresponding knowledge graph. This dual-context paradigm helps nodes within a query graph attain refined internal representations throughout the multi-hop reasoning steps. Through experiments on two datasets, our method consistently enhances the three multi-hop reasoning foundation models, achieving performance improvements of up to 19.5%. Our code is available at https://github.com/kjh9503/caqr.</description>

      <title>Fast Context-Biasing for CTC and Transducer ASR models with CTC-based Word Spotter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate recognition of rare and new words remains a pressing problem for contextualized Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Most context-biasing methods involve modification of the ASR model or the beam-search decoding algorithm, complicating model reuse and slowing down inference. This work presents a new approach to fast context-biasing with CTC-based Word Spotter (CTC-WS) for CTC and Transducer (RNN-T) ASR models. The proposed method matches CTC log-probabilities against a compact context graph to detect potential context-biasing candidates. The valid candidates then replace their greedy recognition counterparts in corresponding frame intervals. A Hybrid Transducer-CTC model enables the CTC-WS application for the Transducer model. The results demonstrate a significant acceleration of the context-biasing recognition with a simultaneous improvement in F-score and WER compared to baseline methods. The proposed method is publicly available in the NVIDIA NeMo toolkit.</description>

      <title>Translating speech with just images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visually grounded speech models link speech to images. We extend this connection by linking images to text via an existing image captioning system, and as a result gain the ability to map speech audio directly to text. This approach can be used for speech translation with just images by having the audio in a different language from the generated captions. We investigate such a system on a real low-resource language, Yor\`ub\'a, and propose a Yor\`ub\'a-to-English speech translation model that leverages pretrained components in order to be able to learn in the low-resource regime. To limit overfitting, we find that it is essential to use a decoding scheme that produces diverse image captions for training. Results show that the predicted translations capture the main semantics of the spoken audio, albeit in a simpler and shorter form.</description>

      <title>Scaling Large-Language-Model-based Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pioneering advancements in large language model-powered agents have underscored the design pattern of multi-agent collaboration, demonstrating that collective intelligence can surpass the capabilities of each individual. Inspired by the neural scaling law, which posits that increasing neurons leads to emergent abilities, this study investigates whether a similar principle applies to increasing agents in multi-agent collaboration. Technically, we propose multi-agent collaboration networks (MacNet), which utilize directed acyclic graphs to organize agents and streamline their interactive reasoning via topological ordering, with solutions derived from their dialogues. Extensive experiments show that MacNet consistently outperforms baseline models, enabling effective agent collaboration across various network topologies and supporting cooperation among more than a thousand agents. Notably, we observed a small-world collaboration phenomenon, where topologies resembling small-world properties achieved superior performance. Additionally, we identified a collaborative scaling law, indicating that normalized solution quality follows a logistic growth pattern as scaling agents, with collaborative emergence occurring much earlier than previously observed instances of neural emergence. The code and data will be available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev.</description>

      <title>EmoBox: Multilingual Multi-corpus Speech Emotion Recognition Toolkit and Benchmark</title>

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) is an important part of human-computer interaction, receiving extensive attention from both industry and academia. However, the current research field of SER has long suffered from the following problems: 1) There are few reasonable and universal splits of the datasets, making comparing different models and methods difficult. 2) No commonly used benchmark covers numerous corpus and languages for researchers to refer to, making reproduction a burden. In this paper, we propose EmoBox, an out-of-the-box multilingual multi-corpus speech emotion recognition toolkit, along with a benchmark for both intra-corpus and cross-corpus settings. For intra-corpus settings, we carefully designed the data partitioning for different datasets. For cross-corpus settings, we employ a foundation SER model, emotion2vec, to mitigate annotation errors and obtain a test set that is fully balanced in speakers and emotions distributions. Based on EmoBox, we present the intra-corpus SER results of 10 pre-trained speech models on 32 emotion datasets with 14 languages, and the cross-corpus SER results on 4 datasets with the fully balanced test sets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest SER benchmark, across language scopes and quantity scales. We hope that our toolkit and benchmark can facilitate the research of SER in the community.</description>

      <title>A Synthetic Dataset for Personal Attribute Inference</title>

Abstract: Recently, powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) have become easily accessible to hundreds of millions of users worldwide. However, their strong capabilities and vast world knowledge do not come without associated privacy risks. In this work, we focus on the emerging privacy threat LLMs pose - the ability to accurately infer personal information from online texts. Despite the growing importance of LLM-based author profiling, research in this area has been hampered by a lack of suitable public datasets, largely due to ethical and privacy concerns associated with real personal data. In this work, we take two steps to address this problem: (i) we construct a simulation framework for the popular social media platform Reddit using LLM agents seeded with synthetic personal profiles; (ii) using this framework, we generate SynthPAI, a diverse synthetic dataset of over 7800 comments manually labeled for personal attributes. We validate our dataset with a human study showing that humans barely outperform random guessing on the task of distinguishing our synthetic comments from real ones. Further, we verify that our dataset enables meaningful personal attribute inference research by showing across 18 state-of-the-art LLMs that our synthetic comments allow us to draw the same conclusions as real-world data. Together, this indicates that our dataset and pipeline provide a strong and privacy-preserving basis for future research toward understanding and mitigating the inference-based privacy threats LLMs pose.</description>

      <title>Advancing Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition via LLM-Based Reformulation and Box-Based Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) task aims to identify named entities, entity types and their corresponding visual regions. GMNER task exhibits two challenging attributes: 1) The tenuous correlation between images and text on social media contributes to a notable proportion of named entities being ungroundable. 2) There exists a distinction between coarse-grained noun phrases used in similar tasks (e.g., phrase localization) and fine-grained named entities. In this paper, we propose RiVEG, a unified framework that reformulates GMNER into a joint MNER-VE-VG task by leveraging large language models (LLMs) as connecting bridges. This reformulation brings two benefits: 1) It enables us to optimize the MNER module for optimal MNER performance and eliminates the need to pre-extract region features using object detection methods, thus naturally addressing the two major limitations of existing GMNER methods. 2) The introduction of Entity Expansion Expression module and Visual Entailment (VE) module unifies Visual Grounding (VG) and Entity Grounding (EG). This endows the proposed framework with unlimited data and model scalability. Furthermore, to address the potential ambiguity stemming from the coarse-grained bounding box output in GMNER, we further construct the new Segmented Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (SMNER) task and corresponding Twitter-SMNER dataset aimed at generating fine-grained segmentation masks, and experimentally demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using box prompt-based Segment Anything Model (SAM) to empower any GMNER model with the ability to accomplish the SMNER task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RiVEG significantly outperforms SoTA methods on four datasets across the MNER, GMNER, and SMNER tasks.</description>

      <title>Instruct Large Language Models to Drive like Humans</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion planning in complex scenarios is the core challenge in autonomous driving. Conventional methods apply predefined rules or learn from driving data to plan the future trajectory. Recent methods seek the knowledge preserved in large language models (LLMs) and apply them in the driving scenarios. Despite the promising results, it is still unclear whether the LLM learns the underlying human logic to drive. In this paper, we propose an InstructDriver method to transform LLM into a motion planner with explicit instruction tuning to align its behavior with humans. We derive driving instruction data based on human logic (e.g., do not cause collisions) and traffic rules (e.g., proceed only when green lights). We then employ an interpretable InstructChain module to further reason the final planning reflecting the instructions. Our InstructDriver allows the injection of human rules and learning from driving data, enabling both interpretability and data scalability. Different from existing methods that experimented on closed-loop or simulated settings, we adopt the real-world closed-loop motion planning nuPlan benchmark for better evaluation. InstructDriver demonstrates the effectiveness of the LLM planner in a real-world closed-loop setting. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/bonbon-rj/InstructDriver.</description>

      <title>MM-KWS: Multi-modal Prompts for Multilingual User-defined Keyword Spotting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose MM-KWS, a novel approach to user-defined keyword spotting leveraging multi-modal enrollments of text and speech templates. Unlike previous methods that focus solely on either text or speech features, MM-KWS extracts phoneme, text, and speech embeddings from both modalities. These embeddings are then compared with the query speech embedding to detect the target keywords. To ensure the applicability of MM-KWS across diverse languages, we utilize a feature extractor incorporating several multilingual pre-trained models. Subsequently, we validate its effectiveness on Mandarin and English tasks. In addition, we have integrated advanced data augmentation tools for hard case mining to enhance MM-KWS in distinguishing confusable words. Experimental results on the LibriPhrase and WenetPhrase datasets demonstrate that MM-KWS outperforms prior methods significantly.</description>

      <title>3D-Properties: Identifying Challenges in DPO and Charting a Path Forward</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference has recently gained tremendous attention, with the canonical yet costly RLHF-PPO and the simple and straightforward Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) as two examples. Despite the efficiency, DPO has rarely be used in the state-of-the-art production-level LLMs, implying its potential pathologies. In this work, we revisit DPO with a comprehensive examination of its empirical efficacy and a systematic comparison with RLHF-PPO. We identify the \textbf{3D}-properties of DPO's learning outcomes: the \textbf{D}rastic drop in the likelihood of rejected responses, the \textbf{D}egradation into LLM unlearning, and the \textbf{D}ispersion effect on unseen responses through experiments with both a carefully designed toy model and practical LLMs on tasks including mathematical problem-solving and instruction following. These findings inherently connect to some observations made by related works and we additionally contribute a plausible theoretical explanation for them. Accordingly, we propose easy regularization methods to mitigate the issues caused by \textbf{3D}-properties, improving the training stability and final performance of DPO. Our contributions also include an investigation into how the distribution of the paired preference data impacts the effectiveness of DPO. We hope this work could offer research directions to narrow the gap between reward-free preference learning methods and reward-based ones.</description>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly demonstrated the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the knowledge-intensive tasks, such as Question-Answering (QA). RAG expands the query context by incorporating external knowledge bases to enhance the response accuracy. However, it would be inefficient to access LLMs multiple times for each query and unreliable to retrieve all the relevant documents by a single query. We find that even though there is low relevance between some critical documents and query, it is possible to retrieve the remaining documents by combining parts of the documents with the query. To mine the relevance, a two-stage retrieval framework called Dynamic-Relevant Retrieval-Augmented Generation (DR-RAG) is proposed to improve document retrieval recall and the accuracy of answers while maintaining efficiency. Also, a small classifier is applied to two different selection strategies to determine the contribution of the retrieved documents to answering the query and retrieve the relatively relevant documents. Meanwhile, DR-RAG call the LLMs only once, which significantly improves the efficiency of the experiment. The experimental results on multi-hop QA datasets show that DR-RAG can significantly improve the accuracy of the answers and achieve new progress in QA systems.</description>

      <title>AI Sandbagging: Language Models can Strategically Underperform on Evaluations</title>

Abstract: Trustworthy capability evaluations are crucial for ensuring the safety of AI systems, and are becoming a key component of AI regulation. However, the developers of an AI system, or the AI system itself, may have incentives for evaluations to understate the AI's actual capability. These conflicting interests lead to the problem of sandbagging $\unicode{x2013}$ which we define as "strategic underperformance on an evaluation". In this paper we assess sandbagging capabilities in contemporary language models (LMs). We prompt frontier LMs, like GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus, to selectively underperform on dangerous capability evaluations, while maintaining performance on general (harmless) capability evaluations. Moreover, we find that models can be fine-tuned, on a synthetic dataset, to hide specific capabilities unless given a password. This behaviour generalizes to high-quality, held-out benchmarks such as WMDP. In addition, we show that both frontier and smaller models can be prompted, or password-locked, to target specific scores on a capability evaluation. Even more, we found that a capable password-locked model (Llama 3 70b) is reasonably able to emulate a less capable model (Llama 2 7b). Overall, our results suggest that capability evaluations are vulnerable to sandbagging. This vulnerability decreases the trustworthiness of evaluations, and thereby undermines important safety decisions regarding the development and deployment of advanced AI systems.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Constrained-Based Causal Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causality is essential for understanding complex systems, such as the economy, the brain, and the climate. Constructing causal graphs often relies on either data-driven or expert-driven approaches, both fraught with challenges. The former methods, like the celebrated PC algorithm, face issues with data requirements and assumptions of causal sufficiency, while the latter demand substantial time and domain knowledge. This work explores the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an alternative to domain experts for causal graph generation. We frame conditional independence queries as prompts to LLMs and employ the PC algorithm with the answers. The performance of the LLM-based conditional independence oracle on systems with known causal graphs shows a high degree of variability. We improve the performance through a proposed statistical-inspired voting schema that allows some control over false-positive and false-negative rates. Inspecting the chain-of-thought argumentation, we find causal reasoning to justify its answer to a probabilistic query. We show evidence that knowledge-based CIT could eventually become a complementary tool for data-driven causal discovery.</description>

Abstract: Significant research has focused on improving the performance of large language model on code-related tasks due to their practical importance. Although performance is typically evaluated using public benchmark datasets, the existing datasets do not account for the concept of \emph{version}, which is crucial in professional software development. In this paper, we introduce VersiCode, the first comprehensive dataset designed to assess the ability of large language models to generate verifiable code for specific library versions. VersiCode encompasses 300 libraries across more than 2,000 versions spanning 9 years. We design two dedicated evaluation tasks: version-specific code completion (VSCC) and version-aware code editing (VACE). Comprehensive experiments are conducted to benchmark the performance of LLMs, revealing the challenging nature of these tasks and VersiCode, that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to generate version-correct code. This dataset, together with the proposed tasks, sheds light on LLMs' capabilities and limitations in handling version-specific code generation, and opens up an important new area of research for further investigation.

      <title>VideoLLaMA 2: Advancing Spatial-Temporal Modeling and Audio Understanding in Video-LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the VideoLLaMA 2, a set of Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) designed to enhance spatial-temporal modeling and audio understanding in video and audio-oriented tasks. Building upon its predecessor, VideoLLaMA 2 incorporates a tailor-made Spatial-Temporal Convolution (STC) connector, which effectively captures the intricate spatial and temporal dynamics of video data. Additionally, we integrate an Audio Branch into the model through joint training, thereby enriching the multimodal understanding capabilities of the model by seamlessly incorporating audio cues. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple-choice video question answering (MC-VQA), open-ended video question answering (OE-VQA), and video captioning (VC) tasks demonstrate that VideoLLaMA 2 consistently achieves competitive results among open-source models and even gets close to some proprietary models on several benchmarks. Furthermore, VideoLLaMA 2 exhibits reasonable improvements in audio-only and audio-video question-answering (AQA &amp; OE-AVQA) benchmarks over existing models. These advancements underline VideoLLaMA 2's superior performance in multimodal comprehension, setting a new standard for intelligent video analysis systems. All models are public to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>Image Textualization: An Automatic Framework for Creating Accurate and Detailed Image Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image description datasets play a crucial role in the advancement of various applications such as image understanding, text-to-image generation, and text-image retrieval. Currently, image description datasets primarily originate from two sources. One source is the scraping of image-text pairs from the web. Despite their abundance, these descriptions are often of low quality and noisy. Another is through human labeling. Datasets such as COCO are generally very short and lack details. Although detailed image descriptions can be annotated by humans, the high annotation cost limits the feasibility. These limitations underscore the need for more efficient and scalable methods to generate accurate and detailed image descriptions. In this paper, we propose an innovative framework termed Image Textualization (IT), which automatically produces high-quality image descriptions by leveraging existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and multiple vision expert models in a collaborative manner, which maximally convert the visual information into text. To address the current lack of benchmarks for detailed descriptions, we propose several benchmarks for comprehensive evaluation, which verifies the quality of image descriptions created by our framework. Furthermore, we show that LLaVA-7B, benefiting from training on IT-curated descriptions, acquire improved capability to generate richer image descriptions, substantially increasing the length and detail of their output with less hallucination.</description>

      <title>Situational Awareness Matters in 3D Vision Language Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Being able to carry out complicated vision language reasoning tasks in 3D space represents a significant milestone in developing household robots and human-centered embodied AI. In this work, we demonstrate that a critical and distinct challenge in 3D vision language reasoning is situational awareness, which incorporates two key components: (1) The autonomous agent grounds its self-location based on a language prompt. (2) The agent answers open-ended questions from the perspective of its calculated position. To address this challenge, we introduce SIG3D, an end-to-end Situation-Grounded model for 3D vision language reasoning. We tokenize the 3D scene into sparse voxel representation and propose a language-grounded situation estimator, followed by a situated question answering module. Experiments on the SQA3D and ScanQA datasets show that SIG3D outperforms state-of-the-art models in situation estimation and question answering by a large margin (e.g., an enhancement of over 30% on situation estimation accuracy). Subsequent analysis corroborates our architectural design choices, explores the distinct functions of visual and textual tokens, and highlights the importance of situational awareness in the domain of 3D question answering.</description>

      <title>Commonsense-T2I Challenge: Can Text-to-Image Generation Models Understand Commonsense?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel task and benchmark for evaluating the ability of text-to-image(T2I) generation models to produce images that fit commonsense in real life, which we call Commonsense-T2I. Given two adversarial text prompts containing an identical set of action words with minor differences, such as "a lightbulb without electricity" v.s. "a lightbulb with electricity", we evaluate whether T2I models can conduct visual-commonsense reasoning, e.g. produce images that fit "the lightbulb is unlit" vs. "the lightbulb is lit" correspondingly. Commonsense-T2I presents an adversarial challenge, providing pairwise text prompts along with expected outputs. The dataset is carefully hand-curated by experts and annotated with fine-grained labels, such as commonsense type and likelihood of the expected outputs, to assist analyzing model behavior. We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art (sota) T2I models and surprisingly find that, there is still a large gap between image synthesis and real life photos--even the DALL-E 3 model could only achieve 48.92% on Commonsense-T2I, and the stable diffusion XL model only achieves 24.92% accuracy. Our experiments show that GPT-enriched prompts cannot solve this challenge, and we include a detailed analysis about possible reasons for such deficiency. We aim for Commonsense-T2I to serve as a high-quality evaluation benchmark for T2I commonsense checking, fostering advancements in real life image generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formal/symbolic semantics can provide canonical, rigid controllability and interpretability to sentence representations due to their \textit{localisation} or \textit{composition} property. How can we deliver such property to the current distributional sentence representations to control and interpret the generation of language models (LMs)? In this work, we theoretically frame the sentence semantics as the composition of \textit{semantic role - word content} features and propose the formal semantic geometry. To inject such geometry into Transformer-based LMs (i.e. GPT2), we deploy Transformer-based Variational AutoEncoder with a supervision approach, where the sentence generation can be manipulated and explained over low-dimensional latent Gaussian space. In addition, we propose a new probing algorithm to guide the movement of sentence vectors over such geometry. Experimental results reveal that the formal semantic geometry can potentially deliver better control and interpretation to sentence generation.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Contextualised Semantic Shift Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic Shift Detection (SSD) is the task of identifying, interpreting, and assessing the possible change over time in the meanings of a target word. Traditionally, SSD has been addressed by linguists and social scientists through manual and time-consuming activities. In the recent years, computational approaches based on Natural Language Processing and word embeddings gained increasing attention to automate SSD as much as possible. In particular, over the past three years, significant advancements have been made almost exclusively based on word contextualised embedding models, which can handle the multiple usages/meanings of the words and better capture the related semantic shifts. In this paper, we survey the approaches based on contextualised embeddings for SSD (i.e., CSSDetection) and we propose a classification framework characterised by meaning representation, time-awareness, and learning modality dimensions. The framework is exploited i) to review the measures for shift assessment, ii) to compare the approaches on performance, and iii) to discuss the current issues in terms of scalability, interpretability, and robustness. Open challenges and future research directions about CSSDetection are finally outlined.</description>

      <title>Learning Disentangled Semantic Spaces of Explanations via Invertible Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disentangled latent spaces usually have better semantic separability and geometrical properties, which leads to better interpretability and more controllable data generation. While this has been well investigated in Computer Vision, in tasks such as image disentanglement, in the NLP domain sentence disentanglement is still comparatively under-investigated. Most previous work have concentrated on disentangling task-specific generative factors, such as sentiment, within the context of style transfer. In this work, we focus on a more general form of sentence disentanglement, targeting the localised modification and control of more general sentence semantic features. To achieve this, we contribute to a novel notion of sentence semantic disentanglement and introduce a flow-based invertible neural network (INN) mechanism integrated with a transformer-based language Autoencoder (AE) in order to deliver latent spaces with better separability properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the model can conform the distributed latent space into a better semantically disentangled sentence space, leading to improved language interpretability and controlled generation when compared to the recent state-of-the-art language VAE models.</description>

      <title>OntoType: Ontology-Guided and Pre-Trained Language Model Assisted Fine-Grained Entity Typing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-grained entity typing (FET), which assigns entities in text with context-sensitive, fine-grained semantic types, is a basic but important task for knowledge extraction from unstructured text. FET has been studied extensively in natural language processing and typically relies on human-annotated corpora for training, which is costly and difficult to scale. Recent studies explore the utilization of pre-trained language models (PLMs) as a knowledge base to generate rich and context-aware weak supervision for FET. However, a PLM still requires direction and guidance to serve as a knowledge base as they often generate a mixture of rough and fine-grained types, or tokens unsuitable for typing. In this study, we vision that an ontology provides a semantics-rich, hierarchical structure, which will help select the best results generated by multiple PLM models and head words. Specifically, we propose a novel annotation-free, ontology-guided FET method, OntoType, which follows a type ontological structure, from coarse to fine, ensembles multiple PLM prompting results to generate a set of type candidates, and refines its type resolution, under the local context with a natural language inference model. Our experiments on the Ontonotes, FIGER, and NYT datasets using their associated ontological structures demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot fine-grained entity typing methods as well as a typical LLM method, ChatGPT. Our error analysis shows that refinement of the existing ontology structures will further improve fine-grained entity typing.</description>

Abstract: E-commerce authoring entails creating engaging, diverse, and targeted content to enhance preference elicitation and retrieval experience. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized content generation, they often fall short in e-commerce applications due to their limited memorization of domain-specific features. This paper proposes LLaMA-E, the unified e-commerce authoring models that address the contextual preferences of customers, sellers, and platforms, the essential objects in e-commerce operation. We design the instruction set derived from tasks of ads generation, query-enhanced product title rewriting, product classification, purchase intent speculation, and general e-commerce Q&amp;A. The instruction formulation ensures the interleaved cover of the presented and required object features, allowing the alignment of base models to parameterise e-commerce knowledge comprehensively. The proposed LLaMA-E models achieve state-of-the-art evaluation performance and exhibit the advantage in zero-shot practical applications. To our knowledge, this is the first LLM tailored to empower authoring applications with comprehensive scenario understanding by integrating features focused on participated objects.</description>

      <title>Retrieving Evidence from EHRs with LLMs: Possibilities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unstructured data in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) often contains critical information -- complementary to imaging -- that could inform radiologists' diagnoses. But the large volume of notes often associated with patients together with time constraints renders manually identifying relevant evidence practically infeasible. In this work we propose and evaluate a zero-shot strategy for using LLMs as a mechanism to efficiently retrieve and summarize unstructured evidence in patient EHR relevant to a given query. Our method entails tasking an LLM to infer whether a patient has, or is at risk of, a particular condition on the basis of associated notes; if so, we ask the model to summarize the supporting evidence. Under expert evaluation, we find that this LLM-based approach provides outputs consistently preferred to a pre-LLM information retrieval baseline. Manual evaluation is expensive, so we also propose and validate a method using an LLM to evaluate (other) LLM outputs for this task, allowing us to scale up evaluation. Our findings indicate the promise of LLMs as interfaces to EHR, but also highlight the outstanding challenge posed by "hallucinations". In this setting, however, we show that model confidence in outputs strongly correlates with faithful summaries, offering a practical means to limit confabulations.</description>

      <title>Ask Again, Then Fail: Large Language Models' Vacillations in Judgment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02174v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observe that current conversational language models often waver in their judgments when faced with follow-up questions, even if the original judgment was correct. This wavering presents a significant challenge for generating reliable responses and building user trust. To comprehensively assess this issue, we introduce a \textsc{Follow-up Questioning Mechanism} along with two metrics to quantify this inconsistency, confirming its widespread presence in current language models. To mitigate this issue, we explore various prompting strategies for closed-source models; moreover, we develop a training-based framework \textsc{Unwavering-FQ} that teaches language models to maintain their originally correct judgments through synthesized high-quality preference data. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our framework and its ability to enhance the general capabilities of models.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Large Language Models for Healthcare: from Data, Technology, and Applications to Accountability and Ethics</title>

Abstract: The utilization of large language models (LLMs) in the Healthcare domain has generated both excitement and concern due to their ability to effectively respond to freetext queries with certain professional knowledge. This survey outlines the capabilities of the currently developed LLMs for Healthcare and explicates their development process, with the aim of providing an overview of the development roadmap from traditional Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) to LLMs. Specifically, we first explore the potential of LLMs to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of various Healthcare applications highlighting both the strengths and limitations. Secondly, we conduct a comparison between the previous PLMs and the latest LLMs, as well as comparing various LLMs with each other. Then we summarize related Healthcare training data, training methods, optimization strategies, and usage. Finally, the unique concerns associated with deploying LLMs in Healthcare settings are investigated, particularly regarding fairness, accountability, transparency and ethics. Our survey provide a comprehensive investigation from perspectives of both computer science and Healthcare specialty. Besides the discussion about Healthcare concerns, we supports the computer science community by compiling a collection of open source resources, such as accessible datasets, the latest methodologies, code implementations, and evaluation benchmarks in the Github. Summarily, we contend that a significant paradigm shift is underway, transitioning from PLMs to LLMs. This shift encompasses a move from discriminative AI approaches to generative AI approaches, as well as a shift from model-centered methodologies to data-centered methodologies. Also, we determine that the biggest obstacle of using LLMs in Healthcare are fairness, accountability, transparency and ethics.</description>

      <title>Finding and Editing Multi-Modal Neurons in Pre-Trained Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms by which multi-modal large language models (LLMs) interpret different modalities and integrate cross-modal representations is becoming increasingly critical for continuous improvements in both academia and industry. In this paper, we propose a novel method to identify key neurons for interpretability -- how multi-modal LLMs bridge visual and textual concepts for captioning. Our method improves conventional works upon efficiency and applied range by removing needs of costly gradient computation. Based on those identified neurons, we further design a multi-modal knowledge editing method, beneficial to mitigate sensitive words or hallucination. For rationale of our design, we provide theoretical assumption. For empirical evaluation, we have conducted extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments. The results not only validate the effectiveness of our methods, but also offer insightful findings that highlight three key properties of multi-modal neurons: sensitivity, specificity and causal-effect, to shed light for future research.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Uncertainty for Large Language Models through Input Clarification Ensembling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty decomposition refers to the task of decomposing the total uncertainty of a predictive model into aleatoric (data) uncertainty, resulting from inherent randomness in the data-generating process, and epistemic (model) uncertainty, resulting from missing information in the model's training data. In large language models (LLMs) specifically, identifying sources of uncertainty is an important step toward improving reliability, trustworthiness, and interpretability, but remains an important open research question. In this paper, we introduce an uncertainty decomposition framework for LLMs, called input clarification ensembling, which can be applied to any pre-trained LLM. Our approach generates a set of clarifications for the input, feeds them into an LLM, and ensembles the corresponding predictions. We show that, when aleatoric uncertainty arises from ambiguity or under-specification in LLM inputs, this approach makes it possible to factor an (unclarified) LLM's predictions into separate aleatoric and epistemic terms, using a decomposition similar to the one employed by Bayesian neural networks. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that input clarification ensembling provides accurate and reliable uncertainty quantification on several language processing tasks.

      <title>A Glitch in the Matrix? Locating and Detecting Language Model Grounding with Fakepedia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have an impressive ability to draw on novel information supplied in their context. Yet the mechanisms underlying this contextual grounding remain unknown, especially in situations where contextual information contradicts factual knowledge stored in the parameters, which LLMs also excel at recalling. Favoring the contextual information is critical for retrieval-augmented generation methods, which enrich the context with up-to-date information, hoping that grounding can rectify outdated or noisy stored knowledge. We present a novel method to study grounding abilities using Fakepedia, a novel dataset of counterfactual texts constructed to clash with a model's internal parametric knowledge. In this study, we introduce Fakepedia, a counterfactual dataset designed to evaluate grounding abilities when the internal parametric knowledge clashes with the contextual information. We benchmark various LLMs with Fakepedia and conduct a causal mediation analysis of LLM components when answering Fakepedia queries, based on our Masked Grouped Causal Tracing (MGCT) method. Through this analysis, we identify distinct computational patterns between grounded and ungrounded responses. We finally demonstrate that distinguishing grounded from ungrounded responses is achievable through computational analysis alone. Our results, together with existing findings about factual recall mechanisms, provide a coherent narrative of how grounding and factual recall mechanisms interact within LLMs.</description>

      <title>Block-Diagonal Orthogonal Relation and Matrix Entity for Knowledge Graph Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary aim of Knowledge Graph embeddings (KGE) is to learn low-dimensional representations of entities and relations for predicting missing facts. While rotation-based methods like RotatE and QuatE perform well in KGE, they face two challenges: limited model flexibility requiring proportional increases in relation size with entity dimension, and difficulties in generalizing the model for higher-dimensional rotations. To address these issues, we introduce OrthogonalE, a novel KGE model employing matrices for entities and block-diagonal orthogonal matrices with Riemannian optimization for relations. This approach enhances the generality and flexibility of KGE models. The experimental results indicate that our new KGE model, OrthogonalE, is both general and flexible, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art KGE models while substantially reducing the number of relation parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06034v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pretrained language models (PLMs) have become remarkably adept at task and language generalization. Nonetheless, they often fail when faced with unseen languages. In this work, we present LinguAlchemy, a regularization method that incorporates various linguistic information covering typological, geographical, and phylogenetic features to align PLMs representation to the corresponding linguistic information on each language. Our LinguAlchemy significantly improves the performance of mBERT and XLM-R on low-resource languages in multiple downstream tasks such as intent classification, news classification, and semantic relatedness compared to fully finetuned models and displaying a high degree of unseen language generalization. We further introduce AlchemyScale and AlchemyTune, extension of LinguAlchemy which adjusts the linguistic regularization weights automatically, alleviating the need for hyperparameter search.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Can Learn Temporal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06853v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, they are not without their flaws and inaccuracies. Recent studies have introduced various methods to mitigate these limitations. Temporal reasoning (TR), in particular, presents a significant challenge for LLMs due to its reliance on diverse temporal concepts and intricate temporal logic. In this paper, we propose TG-LLM, a novel framework towards language-based TR. Instead of reasoning over the original context, we adopt a latent representation, temporal graph (TG) that enhances the learning of TR. A synthetic dataset (TGQA), which is fully controllable and requires minimal supervision, is constructed for fine-tuning LLMs on this text-to-TG translation task. We confirmed in experiments that the capability of TG translation learned on our dataset can be transferred to other TR tasks and benchmarks. On top of that, we teach LLM to perform deliberate reasoning over the TGs via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) bootstrapping and graph data augmentation. We observed that those strategies, which maintain a balance between usefulness and diversity, bring more reliable CoTs and final results than the vanilla CoT distillation.</description>

      <title>How do Large Language Models Learn In-Context? Query and Key Matrices of In-Context Heads are Two Towers for Metric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanism of in-context learning (ICL) on sentence classification tasks with semantically-unrelated labels ("foo"/"bar"). We find intervening in only 1\% heads (named "in-context heads") significantly affects ICL accuracy from 87.6\% to 24.4\%. To understand this phenomenon, we analyze the value-output vectors in these heads and discover that the vectors at each label position contain substantial information about the corresponding labels. Furthermore, we observe that the prediction shift from "foo" to "bar" is due to the respective reduction and increase in these heads' attention scores at "foo" and "bar" positions. Therefore, we propose a hypothesis for ICL: in in-context heads, the value-output matrices extract label features, while the query-key matrices compute the similarity between the features at the last position and those at each label position. The query and key matrices can be considered as two towers that learn the similarity metric between the last position's features and each demonstration at label positions. Using this hypothesis, we explain the majority label bias and recency bias in ICL and propose two methods to reduce these biases by 22\% and 17\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>MLLM-as-a-Judge: Assessing Multimodal LLM-as-a-Judge with Vision-Language Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention recently, showing remarkable potential in artificial general intelligence. However, assessing the utility of MLLMs presents considerable challenges, primarily due to the absence of multimodal benchmarks that align with human preferences. Drawing inspiration from the concept of LLM-as-a-Judge within LLMs, this paper introduces a novel benchmark, termed MLLM-as-a-Judge, to assess the ability of MLLMs in assisting judges across diverse modalities, encompassing three distinct tasks: Scoring Evaluation, Pair Comparison, and Batch Ranking. Our study reveals that, while MLLMs demonstrate remarkable human-like discernment in Pair Comparison, there is a significant divergence from human preferences in Scoring Evaluation and Batch Ranking. Furthermore, a closer examination reveals persistent challenges in the judgment capacities of LLMs, including diverse biases, hallucinatory responses, and inconsistencies in judgment, even in advanced models such as GPT-4V. These findings emphasize the pressing need for enhancements and further research efforts to be undertaken before regarding MLLMs as fully reliable evaluators. In light of this, we advocate for additional efforts dedicated to supporting the continuous development within the domain of MLLM functioning as judges.

      <title>Self-Alignment for Factuality: Mitigating Hallucinations in LLMs via Self-Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite showing increasingly human-like abilities, large language models (LLMs) often struggle with factual inaccuracies, i.e. "hallucinations", even when they hold relevant knowledge. To address these hallucinations, current approaches typically necessitate high-quality human factuality annotations. In this work, we explore Self-Alignment for Factuality, where we leverage the self-evaluation capability of an LLM to provide training signals that steer the model towards factuality. Specifically, we incorporate Self-Eval, a self-evaluation component, to prompt an LLM to validate the factuality of its own generated responses solely based on its internal knowledge. Additionally, we design Self-Knowledge Tuning (SK-Tuning) to augment the LLM's self-evaluation ability by improving the model's confidence estimation and calibration. We then utilize these self-annotated responses to fine-tune the model via Direct Preference Optimization algorithm. We show that the proposed self-alignment approach substantially enhances factual accuracy over Llama family models across three key knowledge-intensive tasks on TruthfulQA and BioGEN.</description>

      <title>Do Llamas Work in English? On the Latent Language of Multilingual Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10588v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We ask whether multilingual language models trained on unbalanced, English-dominated corpora use English as an internal pivot language -- a question of key importance for understanding how language models function and the origins of linguistic bias. Focusing on the Llama-2 family of transformer models, our study uses carefully constructed non-English prompts with a unique correct single-token continuation. From layer to layer, transformers gradually map an input embedding of the final prompt token to an output embedding from which next-token probabilities are computed. Tracking intermediate embeddings through their high-dimensional space reveals three distinct phases, whereby intermediate embeddings (1) start far away from output token embeddings; (2) already allow for decoding a semantically correct next token in the middle layers, but give higher probability to its version in English than in the input language; (3) finally move into an input-language-specific region of the embedding space. We cast these results into a conceptual model where the three phases operate in "input space", "concept space", and "output space", respectively. Crucially, our evidence suggests that the abstract "concept space" lies closer to English than to other languages, which may have important consequences regarding the biases held by multilingual language models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding achieved state-of-the-art translation performance by using COMET, a neural metric that has a high correlation with human evaluation. However, MBR decoding requires quadratic time since it computes the expected score between a translation hypothesis and all reference translations. We propose centroid-based MBR (CBMBR) decoding to improve the speed of MBR decoding. Our method clusters the reference translations in the feature space, and then calculates the score using the centroids of each cluster. The experimental results show that our CBMBR not only improved the decoding speed of the expected score calculation 5.7 times, but also outperformed vanilla MBR decoding in translation quality by up to 0.5 COMET in the WMT'22 En$\leftrightarrow$Ja, En$\leftrightarrow$De, En$\leftrightarrow$Zh, and WMT'23 En$\leftrightarrow$Ja translation tasks.</description>

      <title>When Do LLMs Need Retrieval Augmentation? Mitigating LLMs' Overconfidence Helps Retrieval Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been found to have difficulty knowing they do not possess certain knowledge and tend to provide specious answers in such cases. Retrieval Augmentation (RA) has been extensively studied to mitigate LLMs' hallucinations. However, due to the extra overhead and unassured quality of retrieval, it may not be optimal to conduct RA all the time. A straightforward idea is to only conduct retrieval when LLMs are uncertain about a question. This motivates us to enhance the LLMs' ability to perceive their knowledge boundaries to help RA. In this paper, we first quantitatively measure LLMs' such ability and confirm their overconfidence. Then, we study how LLMs' certainty about a question correlates with their dependence on external retrieved information. We propose several methods to enhance LLMs' perception of knowledge boundaries and show that they are effective in reducing overconfidence. Additionally, equipped with these methods, LLMs can achieve comparable or even better performance of RA with much fewer retrieval calls.</description>

      <title>Machine-Generated Text Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-Generated Text (MGT) detection aims to identify a piece of text as machine or human written. Prior work has primarily formulated MGT detection as a binary classification task over an entire document, with limited work exploring cases where only part of a document is machine generated. This paper provides the first in-depth study of MGT that localizes the portions of a document that were machine generated. Thus, if a bad actor were to change a key portion of a news article to spread misinformation, whole document MGT detection may fail since the vast majority is human written, but our approach can succeed due to its granular approach. A key challenge in our MGT localization task is that short spans of text, e.g., a single sentence, provides little information indicating if it is machine generated due to its short length. To address this, we leverage contextual information, where we predict whether multiple sentences are machine or human written at once. This enables our approach to identify changes in style or content to boost performance. A gain of 4-13% mean Average Precision (mAP) over prior work demonstrates the effectiveness of approach on five diverse datasets: GoodNews, VisualNews, WikiText, Essay, and WP. We release our implementation at https://github.com/Zhongping-Zhang/MGT_Localization.</description>

      <title>BlendSQL: A Scalable Dialect for Unifying Hybrid Question Answering in Relational Algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many existing end-to-end systems for hybrid question answering tasks can often be boiled down to a "prompt-and-pray" paradigm, where the user has limited control and insight into the intermediate reasoning steps used to achieve the final result. Additionally, due to the context size limitation of many transformer-based LLMs, it is often not reasonable to expect that the full structured and unstructured context will fit into a given prompt in a zero-shot setting, let alone a few-shot setting. We introduce BlendSQL, a superset of SQLite to act as a unified dialect for orchestrating reasoning across both unstructured and structured data. For hybrid question answering tasks involving multi-hop reasoning, we encode the full decomposed reasoning roadmap into a single interpretable BlendSQL query. Notably, we show that BlendSQL can scale to massive datasets and improve the performance of end-to-end systems while using 35% fewer tokens. Our code is available and installable as a package at https://github.com/parkervg/blendsql.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that finetuning is a promising approach to 'unlearn' concepts from large language models. However, finetuning can be expensive, as it requires both generating a set of examples and running iterations of finetuning to update the model. In this work, we show that simple guardrail-based approaches such as prompting and filtering can achieve unlearning results comparable to finetuning. We recommend that researchers investigate these lightweight baselines when evaluating the performance of more computationally intensive finetuning methods. While we do not claim that methods such as prompting or filtering are universal solutions to the problem of unlearning, our work suggests the need for evaluation metrics that can better separate the power of guardrails vs. finetuning, and highlights scenarios where guardrails expose possible unintended behavior in existing metrics and benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Truth-Aware Context Selection: Mitigating Hallucinations of Large Language Models Being Misled by Untruthful Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive text generation capabilities, they are easily misled by untruthful contexts provided by users or knowledge augmentation tools, leading to hallucinations. To alleviate LLMs from being misled by untruthful context and take advantage of knowledge augmentation, we propose Truth-Aware Context Selection (TACS), a lightweight method to adaptively recognize and mask untruthful context from the inputs. TACS begins by performing truth detection on the input context, leveraging the parameterized knowledge within the LLM. Subsequently, it constructs a corresponding attention mask based on the truthfulness of each position, selecting the truthful context and discarding the untruthful context. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation metric, Disturbance Adaption Rate, to further study the LLMs' ability to accept truthful information and resist untruthful information. Experimental results indicate that TACS can effectively filter untruthful context and significantly improve the overall quality of LLMs' responses when presented with misleading information.</description>

      <title>Iterative Refinement of Project-Level Code Context for Precise Code Generation with Compiler Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in automated code generation. Yet, LLM-generated code may contain errors in API usage, class, data structure, or missing project-specific information. As much of this project-specific context cannot fit into the prompts of LLMs, we must find ways to allow the model to explore the project-level code context. We present CoCoGen, a new code generation approach that uses compiler feedback to improve the LLM-generated code. CoCoGen first leverages static analysis to identify mismatches between the generated code and the project's context. It then iteratively aligns and fixes the identified errors using information extracted from the code repository. We integrate CoCoGen with two representative LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5-Turbo and Code Llama (13B), and apply it to Python code generation. Experimental results show that CoCoGen significantly improves the vanilla LLMs by over 80% in generating code dependent on the project context and consistently outperforms the existing retrieval-based code generation baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Expert-Token-Routing, a unified generalist framework that facilitates seamless integration of multiple expert LLMs. Our framework represents expert LLMs as special expert tokens within the vocabulary of a meta LLM. The meta LLM can route to an expert LLM like generating new tokens. Expert-Token-Routing not only supports learning the implicit expertise of expert LLMs from existing instruction dataset but also allows for dynamic extension of new expert LLMs in a plug-and-play manner. It also conceals the detailed collaboration process from the user's perspective, facilitating interaction as though it were a singular LLM. Our framework outperforms various existing multi-LLM collaboration paradigms across benchmarks that incorporate six diverse expert domains, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness in building generalist LLM system via synergizing multiple expert LLMs.</description>

      <title>LLaVA-Gemma: Accelerating Multimodal Foundation Models with a Compact Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We train a suite of multimodal foundation models (MMFM) using the popular LLaVA framework with the recently released Gemma family of large language models (LLMs). Of particular interest is the 2B parameter Gemma model, which provides opportunities to construct capable small-scale MMFMs. In line with findings from other papers in this space, we test the effect of ablating three design features: pretraining the connector, utilizing a more powerful image backbone, and increasing the size of the language backbone. The resulting models, which we call LLaVA-Gemma, exhibit moderate performance on an array of evaluations, but fail to improve past the current comparably sized SOTA models. Closer analysis of performance shows mixed effects; skipping pretraining tends to reduce performance, larger vision models sometimes improve performance, and increasing language model size has inconsistent effects. We publicly release training recipes, code and weights for our models for the LLaVA-Gemma models.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable proficiency in comprehending and generating natural language. On the other hand, personalized LLM response generation holds the potential to offer substantial benefits for individuals in critical areas such as medical. Existing research has explored memory-augmented methods to prompt the LLM with pre-stored user-specific knowledge for personalized response generation in terms of new queries. We contend that such paradigm is unable to perceive fine-granularity information. In this study, we propose a novel \textbf{M}emory-\textbf{i}njected approach using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and along with a Bayesian Optimisation searching strategy to achieve \textbf{L}LM \textbf{P}ersonalization(\textbf{MiLP}).</description>

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment, the meaningful similarity of representations across languages in multilingual language models, has been an active field of research in recent years. We survey the literature of techniques to improve cross-lingual alignment, providing a taxonomy of methods and summarising insights from throughout the field. We present different understandings of cross-lingual alignment and their limitations. We provide a qualitative summary of results from a large number of surveyed papers. Finally, we discuss how these insights may be applied not only to encoder models, where this topic has been heavily studied, but also to encoder-decoder or even decoder-only models, and argue that an effective trade-off between language-neutral and language-specific information is key.</description>

      <title>ToNER: Type-oriented Named Entity Recognition with Generative Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the fine-tuned generative models have been proven more powerful than the previous tagging-based or span-based models on named entity recognition (NER) task. It has also been found that the information related to entities, such as entity types, can prompt a model to achieve NER better. However, it is not easy to determine the entity types indeed existing in the given sentence in advance, and inputting too many potential entity types would distract the model inevitably. To exploit entity types' merit on promoting NER task, in this paper we propose a novel NER framework, namely ToNER based on a generative model. In ToNER, a type matching model is proposed at first to identify the entity types most likely to appear in the sentence. Then, we append a multiple binary classification task to fine-tune the generative model's encoder, so as to generate the refined representation of the input sentence. Moreover, we add an auxiliary task for the model to discover the entity types which further fine-tunes the model to output more accurate results. Our extensive experiments on some NER benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our proposed strategies in ToNER that are oriented towards entity types' exploitation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, directly using large language models (LLMs) has been shown to be the most reliable method to evaluate QA models. However, it suffers from limited interpretability, high cost, and environmental harm. To address these, we propose to use soft EM with entity-driven answer set expansion. Our approach expands the gold answer set to include diverse surface forms, based on the observation that the surface forms often follow particular patterns depending on the entity type. The experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional evaluation methods by a large margin. Moreover, the reliability of our evaluation method is comparable to that of LLM-based ones, while offering the benefits of high interpretability and reduced environmental harm.</description>

      <title>From Complexity to Clarity: How AI Enhances Perceptions of Scientists and the Public's Understanding of Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper evaluated the effectiveness of using generative AI to simplify science communication and enhance the public's understanding of science. By comparing lay summaries of journal articles from PNAS, yoked to those generated by AI, this work first assessed linguistic simplicity across such summaries and public perceptions. Study 1a analyzed simplicity features of PNAS abstracts (scientific summaries) and significance statements (lay summaries), observing that lay summaries were indeed linguistically simpler, but effect size differences were small. Study 1b used a large language model, GPT-4, to create significance statements based on paper abstracts and this more than doubled the average effect size without fine-tuning. Study 2 experimentally demonstrated that simply-written GPT summaries facilitated more favorable perceptions of scientists (they were perceived as more credible and trustworthy, but less intelligent) than more complexly-written human PNAS summaries. Crucially, Study 3 experimentally demonstrated that participants comprehended scientific writing better after reading simple GPT summaries compared to complex PNAS summaries. In their own words, participants also summarized scientific papers in a more detailed and concrete manner after reading GPT summaries compared to PNAS summaries of the same article. AI has the potential to engage scientific communities and the public via a simple language heuristic, advocating for its integration into scientific dissemination for a more informed society.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to understand emotions is an essential component of human-like artificial intelligence, as emotions greatly influence human cognition, decision making, and social interactions. In addition to emotion recognition in conversations, the task of identifying the potential causes behind an individual's emotional state in conversations, is of great importance in many application scenarios. We organize SemEval-2024 Task 3, named Multimodal Emotion Cause Analysis in Conversations, which aims at extracting all pairs of emotions and their corresponding causes from conversations. Under different modality settings, it consists of two subtasks: Textual Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction in Conversations (TECPE) and Multimodal Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction in Conversations (MECPE). The shared task has attracted 143 registrations and 216 successful submissions. In this paper, we introduce the task, dataset and evaluation settings, summarize the systems of the top teams, and discuss the findings of the participants.</description>

      <title>Faithful Logical Reasoning via Symbolic Chain-of-Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the recent Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique enhances the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) with the theory of mind, it might still struggle in handling logical reasoning that relies much on symbolic expressions and rigid deducing rules. To strengthen the logical reasoning capability of LLMs, we propose a novel Symbolic Chain-of-Thought, namely SymbCoT, a fully LLM-based framework that integrates symbolic expressions and logic rules with CoT prompting. Technically, building upon an LLM, SymbCoT 1) first translates the natural language context into the symbolic format, and then 2) derives a step-by-step plan to solve the problem with symbolic logical rules, 3) followed by a verifier to check the translation and reasoning chain. Via thorough evaluations on 5 standard datasets with both First-Order Logic and Constraint Optimization symbolic expressions, SymbCoT shows striking improvements over the CoT method consistently, meanwhile refreshing the current state-of-the-art performances. We further demonstrate that our system advances in more faithful, flexible, and explainable logical reasoning. To our knowledge, this is the first to combine symbolic expressions and rules into CoT for logical reasoning with LLMs. Code is open at https://github.com/Aiden0526/SymbCoT.</description>

      <title>Hate Speech Detection with Generalizable Target-aware Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To counter the side effect brought by the proliferation of social media platforms, hate speech detection (HSD) plays a vital role in halting the dissemination of toxic online posts at an early stage. However, given the ubiquitous topical communities on social media, a trained HSD classifier easily becomes biased towards specific targeted groups (e.g., female and black people), where a high rate of false positive/negative results can significantly impair public trust in the fairness of content moderation mechanisms, and eventually harm the diversity of online society. Although existing fairness-aware HSD methods can smooth out some discrepancies across targeted groups, they are mostly specific to a narrow selection of targets that are assumed to be known and fixed. This inevitably prevents those methods from generalizing to real-world use cases where new targeted groups constantly emerge over time. To tackle this defect, we propose Generalizable target-aware Fairness (GetFair), a new method for fairly classifying each post that contains diverse and even unseen targets during inference. To remove the HSD classifier's spurious dependence on target-related features, GetFair trains a series of filter functions in an adversarial pipeline, so as to deceive the discriminator that recovers the targeted group from filtered post embeddings. To maintain scalability and generalizability, we innovatively parameterize all filter functions via a hypernetwork that is regularized by the semantic affinity among targets. Taking a target's pretrained word embedding as input, the hypernetwork generates the weights used by each target-specific filter on-the-fly without storing dedicated filter parameters. Finally, comparative experiments on two HSD datasets have shown advantageous performance of GetFair on out-of-sample targets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective communication during health crises is critical, with social media serving as a key platform for public health experts (PHEs) to engage with the public. However, it also amplifies pseudo-experts promoting contrarian views. Despite its importance, the role of emotional and moral language in PHEs' communication during COVID-19 remains under explored. This study examines how PHEs and pseudo-experts communicated on Twitter during the pandemic, focusing on emotional and moral language and their engagement with political elites. Analyzing tweets from 489 PHEs and 356 pseudo-experts from January 2020 to January 2021, alongside public responses, we identified key priorities and differences in messaging strategy. PHEs prioritize masking, healthcare, education, and vaccines, using positive emotional language like optimism. In contrast, pseudo-experts discuss therapeutics and lockdowns more frequently, employing negative emotions like pessimism and disgust. Negative emotional and moral language tends to drive engagement, but positive language from PHEs fosters positivity in public responses. PHEs exhibit liberal partisanship, expressing more positivity towards liberals and negativity towards conservative elites, while pseudo-experts show conservative partisanship. These findings shed light on the polarization of COVID-19 discourse and underscore the importance of strategic use of emotional and moral language by experts to mitigate polarization and enhance public trust.</description>

      <title>Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.</description>

      <title>HYDRA: Model Factorization Framework for Black-Box LLM Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalization has emerged as a critical research area in modern intelligent systems, focusing on mining users' behavioral history and adapting to their preferences for delivering tailored experiences. Despite the remarkable few-shot capabilities exhibited by black-box large language models (LLMs), the inherent opacity of their model parameters presents significant challenges in aligning the generated output with individual expectations. Existing solutions have primarily focused on prompt design to incorporate user-specific profiles and behaviors; however, such approaches often struggle to generalize effectively due to their inability to capture shared knowledge among all users. To address these challenges, we propose HYDRA, a model factorization framework that captures both user-specific behavior patterns from historical data and shared general knowledge among all users to deliver personalized generation. In order to capture user-specific behavior patterns, we first train a reranker to prioritize the most useful information from top-retrieved relevant historical records. By combining the prioritized history with the corresponding query, we train an adapter to align the output with individual user-specific preferences, eliminating the reliance on access to inherent model parameters of black-box LLMs. Both the reranker and the adapter can be decomposed into a base model with multiple user-specific heads, resembling a hydra. The base model maintains shared knowledge across users, while the multiple personal heads capture user-specific preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that HYDRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art prompt-based methods by an average relative improvement of 9.01% across five diverse personalization tasks in the LaMP benchmark. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/night-chen/HYDRA.</description>

      <title>Text Injection for Neural Contextual Biasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural contextual biasing effectively improves automatic speech recognition (ASR) for crucial phrases within a speaker's context, particularly those that are infrequent in the training data. This work proposes contextual text injection (CTI) to enhance contextual ASR. CTI leverages not only the paired speech-text data, but also a much larger corpus of unpaired text to optimize the ASR model and its biasing component. Unpaired text is converted into speech-like representations and used to guide the model's attention towards relevant bias phrases. Moreover, we introduce a contextual text-injected (CTI) minimum word error rate (MWER) training, which minimizes the expected WER caused by contextual biasing when unpaired text is injected into the model. Experiments show that CTI with 100 billion text sentences can achieve up to 43.3% relative WER reduction from a strong neural biasing model. CTI-MWER provides a further relative improvement of 23.5%.</description>

      <title>ChatLang-8: An LLM-Based Synthetic Data Generation Framework for Grammatical Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore and improve the capabilities of LLMs to generate data for grammatical error correction (GEC). When merely producing parallel sentences, their patterns are too simplistic to be valuable as a corpus. To address this issue, we propose an automated framework that includes a Subject Selector, Grammar Selector, Prompt Manager, and Evaluator. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset for GEC tasks, named ChatLang-8, which encompasses eight types of subject nouns and 23 types of grammar. It consists of 1 million pairs featuring human-like grammatical errors. Our experiments reveal that ChatLang-8 exhibits a more uniform pattern composition compared to existing GEC datasets. Furthermore, we observe improved model performance when using ChatLang-8 instead of existing GEC datasets. The experimental results suggest that our framework and ChatLang-8 are valuable resources for enhancing ChatGPT's data generation capabilities.</description>

      <title>Using Synchronic Definitions and Semantic Relations to Classify Semantic Change Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is abundant evidence of the fact that the way words change their meaning can be classified in different types of change, highlighting the relationship between the old and new meanings (among which generalization, specialization and co-hyponymy transfer). In this paper, we present a way of detecting these types of change by constructing a model that leverages information both from synchronic lexical relations and definitions of word meanings. Specifically, we use synset definitions and hierarchy information from WordNet and test it on a digitized version of Blank's (1997) dataset of semantic change types. Finally, we show how the sense relationships can improve models for both approximation of human judgments of semantic relatedness as well as binary Lexical Semantic Change Detection.</description>

      <title>What Languages are Easy to Language-Model? A Perspective from Learning Probabilistic Regular Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What can large language models learn? By definition, language models (LM) are distributions over strings. Therefore, an intuitive way of addressing the above question is to formalize it as a matter of learnability of classes of distributions over strings. While prior work in this direction focused on assessing the theoretical limits, in contrast, we seek to understand the empirical learnability. Unlike prior empirical work, we evaluate neural LMs on their home turf-learning probabilistic languages-rather than as classifiers of formal languages. In particular, we investigate the learnability of regular LMs (RLMs) by RNN and Transformer LMs. We empirically test the learnability of RLMs as a function of various complexity parameters of the RLM and the hidden state size of the neural LM. We find that the RLM rank, which corresponds to the size of linear space spanned by the logits of its conditional distributions, and the expected length of sampled strings are strong and significant predictors of learnability for both RNNs and Transformers. Several other predictors also reach significance, but with differing patterns between RNNs and Transformers.</description>

      <title>Improving Logits-based Detector without Logits from Black-box LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized text generation, producing outputs that closely mimic human writing. This blurring of lines between machine- and human-written text presents new challenges in distinguishing one from the other a task further complicated by the frequent updates and closed nature of leading proprietary LLMs. Traditional logits-based detection methods leverage surrogate models for identifying LLM-generated content when the exact logits are unavailable from black-box LLMs. However, these methods grapple with the misalignment between the distributions of the surrogate and the often undisclosed target models, leading to performance degradation, particularly with the introduction of new, closed-source models. Furthermore, while current methodologies are generally effective when the source model is identified, they falter in scenarios where the model version remains unknown, or the test set comprises outputs from various source models. To address these limitations, we present Distribution-Aligned LLMs Detection (DALD), an innovative framework that redefines the state-of-the-art performance in black-box text detection even without logits from source LLMs. DALD is designed to align the surrogate model's distribution with that of unknown target LLMs, ensuring enhanced detection capability and resilience against rapid model iterations with minimal training investment. By leveraging corpus samples from publicly accessible outputs of advanced models such as ChatGPT, GPT-4 and Claude-3, DALD fine-tunes surrogate models to synchronize with unknown source model distributions effectively.</description>

      <title>II-Bench: An Image Implication Understanding Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in the development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have consistently led to new breakthroughs on various benchmarks. In response, numerous challenging and comprehensive benchmarks have been proposed to more accurately assess the capabilities of MLLMs. However, there is a dearth of exploration of the higher-order perceptual capabilities of MLLMs. To fill this gap, we propose the Image Implication understanding Benchmark, II-Bench, which aims to evaluate the model's higher-order perception of images. Through extensive experiments on II-Bench across multiple MLLMs, we have made significant findings. Initially, a substantial gap is observed between the performance of MLLMs and humans on II-Bench. The pinnacle accuracy of MLLMs attains 74.8%, whereas human accuracy averages 90%, peaking at an impressive 98%. Subsequently, MLLMs perform worse on abstract and complex images, suggesting limitations in their ability to understand high-level semantics and capture image details. Finally, it is observed that most models exhibit enhanced accuracy when image sentiment polarity hints are incorporated into the prompts. This observation underscores a notable deficiency in their inherent understanding of image sentiment. We believe that II-Bench will inspire the community to develop the next generation of MLLMs, advancing the journey towards expert artificial general intelligence (AGI). II-Bench is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/m-a-p/II-Bench.</description>

      <title>LINGOLY: A Benchmark of Olympiad-Level Linguistic Reasoning Puzzles in Low-Resource and Extinct Languages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the LingOly benchmark, a novel benchmark for advanced reasoning abilities in large language models. Using challenging Linguistic Olympiad puzzles, we evaluate (i) capabilities for in-context identification and generalisation of linguistic patterns in very low-resource or extinct languages, and (ii) abilities to follow complex task instructions. The LingOly benchmark covers more than 90 mostly low-resource languages, minimising issues of data contamination, and contains 1,133 problems across 6 formats and 5 levels of human difficulty. We assess performance with both direct accuracy and comparison to a no-context baseline to penalise memorisation. Scores from 11 state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate the benchmark to be challenging, and models perform poorly on the higher difficulty problems. On harder problems, even the top model only achieved 38.7% accuracy, 24.7% improvement over the no-context baseline. Large closed models typically outperform open models, and in general, the higher resource the language, the better the scores. These results indicate, in absence of memorisation, true multi-step out-of-domain reasoning remains a challenge for current language models.</description>

      <title>Self-Tuning: Instructing LLMs to Effectively Acquire New Knowledge through Self-Teaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to provide up-to-date information due to their one-time training and the constantly evolving nature of the world. To keep LLMs current, existing approaches typically involve continued pre-training on new documents. However, they frequently face difficulties in extracting stored knowledge. Motivated by the remarkable success of the Feynman Technique in efficient human learning, we introduce Self-Tuning, a learning framework aimed at improving an LLM's ability to effectively acquire new knowledge from raw documents through self-teaching. Specifically, we develop a Self-Teaching strategy that augments the documents with a set of knowledge-intensive tasks created in a self-supervised manner, focusing on three crucial aspects: memorization, comprehension, and self-reflection. Additionally, we introduce three Wiki-Newpages-2023-QA datasets to facilitate an in-depth analysis of an LLM's knowledge acquisition ability concerning memorization, extraction, and reasoning. Extensive experimental results on Llama2 family models reveal that Self-Tuning consistently exhibits superior performance across all knowledge acquisition tasks and excels in preserving previous knowledge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present mHuBERT-147, the first general-purpose massively multilingual HuBERT speech representation model trained on 90K hours of clean, open-license data. To scale up the multi-iteration HuBERT approach, we use faiss-based clustering, achieving 5.2x faster label assignment than the original method. We also apply a new multilingual batching up-sampling strategy, leveraging both language and dataset diversity. After 3 training iterations, our compact 95M parameter mHuBERT-147 outperforms larger models trained on substantially more data. We rank second and first on the ML-SUPERB 10min and 1h leaderboards, with SOTA scores for 3 tasks. Across ASR/LID tasks, our model consistently surpasses XLS-R (300M params; 436K hours) and demonstrates strong competitiveness against the much larger MMS (1B params; 491K hours). Our findings indicate that mHuBERT-147 is a promising model for multilingual speech tasks, offering an unprecedented balance between high performance and parameter efficiency.</description>

      <title>Reasoning in Token Economies: Budget-Aware Evaluation of LLM Reasoning Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A diverse array of reasoning strategies has been proposed to elicit the capabilities of large language models. However, in this paper, we point out that traditional evaluations which focus solely on performance metrics miss a key factor: the increased effectiveness due to additional compute. By overlooking this aspect, a skewed view of strategy efficiency is often presented. This paper introduces a framework that incorporates the compute budget into the evaluation, providing a more informative comparison that takes into account both performance metrics and computational cost. In this budget-aware perspective, we find that complex reasoning strategies often don't surpass simpler baselines purely due to algorithmic ingenuity, but rather due to the larger computational resources allocated. When we provide a simple baseline like chain-of-thought self-consistency with comparable compute resources, it frequently outperforms reasoning strategies proposed in the literature. In this scale-aware perspective, we find that unlike self-consistency, certain strategies such as multi-agent debate or Reflexion can become worse if more compute budget is utilized.</description>

      <title>ICSVR: Investigating Compositional and Syntactic Understanding in Video Retrieval Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video retrieval (VR) involves retrieving the ground truth video from the video database given a text caption or vice-versa. The two important components of compositionality: objects &amp; attributes and actions are joined using correct syntax to form a proper text query. These components (objects &amp; attributes, actions and syntax) each play an important role to help distinguish among videos and retrieve the correct ground truth video. However, it is unclear what is the effect of these components on the video retrieval performance. We therefore, conduct a systematic study to evaluate the compositional and syntactic understanding of video retrieval models on standard benchmarks such as MSRVTT, MSVD and DIDEMO. The study is performed on two categories of video retrieval models: (i) which are pre-trained on video-text pairs and fine-tuned on downstream video retrieval datasets (Eg. Frozen-in-Time, Violet, MCQ etc.) (ii) which adapt pre-trained image-text representations like CLIP for video retrieval (Eg. CLIP4Clip, XCLIP, CLIP2Video etc.). Our experiments reveal that actions and syntax play a minor role compared to objects &amp; attributes in video understanding. Moreover, video retrieval models that use pre-trained image-text representations (CLIP) have better syntactic and compositional understanding as compared to models pre-trained on video-text data. The code is available at https://github.com/IntelLabs/multimodal_cognitive_ai/tree/main/ICSVR</description>

      <title>Text-CRS: A Generalized Certified Robustness Framework against Textual Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The language models, especially the basic text classification models, have been shown to be susceptible to textual adversarial attacks such as synonym substitution and word insertion attacks. To defend against such attacks, a growing body of research has been devoted to improving the model robustness. However, providing provable robustness guarantees instead of empirical robustness is still widely unexplored. In this paper, we propose Text-CRS, a generalized certified robustness framework for natural language processing (NLP) based on randomized smoothing. To our best knowledge, existing certified schemes for NLP can only certify the robustness against $\ell_0$ perturbations in synonym substitution attacks. Representing each word-level adversarial operation (i.e., synonym substitution, word reordering, insertion, and deletion) as a combination of permutation and embedding transformation, we propose novel smoothing theorems to derive robustness bounds in both permutation and embedding space against such adversarial operations. To further improve certified accuracy and radius, we consider the numerical relationships between discrete words and select proper noise distributions for the randomized smoothing. Finally, we conduct substantial experiments on multiple language models and datasets. Text-CRS can address all four different word-level adversarial operations and achieve a significant accuracy improvement. We also provide the first benchmark on certified accuracy and radius of four word-level operations, besides outperforming the state-of-the-art certification against synonym substitution attacks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Automatic Prosody Annotation with Contrastive Pretraining of SSWP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In expressive and controllable Text-to-Speech (TTS), explicit prosodic features significantly improve the naturalness and controllability of synthesised speech. However, manual prosody annotation is labor-intensive and inconsistent. To address this issue, a two-stage automatic annotation pipeline is novelly proposed in this paper. In the first stage, we use contrastive pretraining of Speech-Silence and Word-Punctuation (SSWP) pairs to enhance prosodic information in latent representations. In the second stage, we build a multi-modal prosody annotator, comprising pretrained encoders, a text-speech fusing scheme, and a sequence classifier. Experiments on English prosodic boundaries demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with 0.72 and 0.93 f1 score for Prosodic Word and Prosodic Phrase boundary respectively, while bearing remarkable robustness to data scarcity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems predominantly cater to monolingual inputs and struggle with the complexity introduced by mixed language audio. In this paper, we present a novel Multi-Agent Data Generation Framework (MADGF) to address this challenge. We finetune the open-source multilingual ASR model, Whisper, utilizing our generated Mixed Cantonese and English (MCE) audio dataset, Which achieved an impressive Mix Error Rate (MER) of 14.28%, 35.13% lower than the original model. Meanwhile, single language recognition ability is not affected, 12.6% Character Error Rate (CER) in Common voice zh-HK, 14.8% Word Error Rate (WER) in Common voice en. However, these metrics do not encompass all aspects critical to the ASR systems. Hence, we propose a novel evaluation metric called Fidelity to the Original Audio, Accuracy, and Latency (FAL).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising instruction following capabilities on vision-language tasks. In this work, we introduce VISUAL MODALITY INSTRUCTION (VIM), and investigate how well multimodal models can understand textual instructions provided in pixels, despite not being explicitly trained on such data during pretraining or fine-tuning. We adapt VIM to eight benchmarks, including OKVQA, MM-Vet, MathVista, MMMU, and probe diverse MLLMs in both the text-modality instruction (TEM) setting and VIM setting. Notably, we observe a significant performance disparity between the original TEM and VIM settings for open-source MLLMs, indicating that open-source MLLMs face greater challenges when text instruction is presented solely in image form. To address this issue, we train v-MLLM, a generalizable model that is capable to conduct robust instruction following in both text-modality and visual-modality instructions.</description>

      <title>EgoPlan-Bench: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Human-Level Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06722</link>

Abstract: The pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been accelerated by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which exhibit superior reasoning, generalization capabilities, and proficiency in processing multimodal inputs. A crucial milestone in the evolution of AGI is the attainment of human-level planning, a fundamental ability for making informed decisions in complex environments, and solving a wide range of real-world problems. Despite the impressive advancements in MLLMs, a question remains: How far are current MLLMs from achieving human-level planning? To shed light on this question, we introduce EgoPlan-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the planning abilities of MLLMs in real-world scenarios from an egocentric perspective, mirroring human perception. EgoPlan-Bench emphasizes the evaluation of planning capabilities of MLLMs, featuring realistic tasks, diverse action plans, and intricate visual observations. Our rigorous evaluation of a wide range of MLLMs reveals that EgoPlan-Bench poses significant challenges, highlighting a substantial scope for improvement in MLLMs to achieve human-level task planning. To facilitate this advancement, we further present EgoPlan-IT, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset that effectively enhances model performance on EgoPlan-Bench. We have made all codes, data, and a maintained benchmark leaderboard available to advance future research.</description>

      <title>diff History for Neural Language Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Language Models (LMs) offer an exciting solution for general-purpose embodied control. However, a key technical issue arises when using an LM-based controller: environment observations must be converted to text, which coupled with history, results in long and verbose textual prompts. As a result, prior work in LM agents is limited to restricted domains with small observation size as well as minimal needs for interaction history or instruction tuning. In this paper, we introduce diff history, a simple and highly effective solution to these issues. By applying the Unix diff command on consecutive text observations in the interaction histories used to prompt LM policies, we can both abstract away redundant information and focus the content of textual inputs on the salient changes in the environment. On NetHack, an unsolved video game that requires long-horizon reasoning for decision-making, LMs tuned with diff history match state-of-the-art performance for neural agents while needing 1800x fewer training examples compared to prior work. Even on the simpler BabyAI-Text environment with concise text observations, we find that although diff history increases the length of prompts, the representation it provides offers a 25% improvement in the efficiency of low-sample instruction tuning. Further, we show that diff history scales favorably across different tuning dataset sizes. We open-source our code and data to https://diffhistory.github.io.</description>

      <title>SciMMIR: Benchmarking Scientific Multi-modal Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal information retrieval (MMIR) is a rapidly evolving field, where significant progress, particularly in image-text pairing, has been made through advanced representation learning and cross-modality alignment research. However, current benchmarks for evaluating MMIR performance in image-text pairing within the scientific domain show a notable gap, where chart and table images described in scholarly language usually do not play a significant role. To bridge this gap, we develop a specialised scientific MMIR (SciMMIR) benchmark by leveraging open-access paper collections to extract data relevant to the scientific domain. This benchmark comprises 530K meticulously curated image-text pairs, extracted from figures and tables with detailed captions in scientific documents. We further annotate the image-text pairs with two-level subset-subcategory hierarchy annotations to facilitate a more comprehensive evaluation of the baselines. We conducted zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations on prominent multi-modal image-captioning and visual language models, such as CLIP and BLIP. Our analysis offers critical insights for MMIR in the scientific domain, including the impact of pre-training and fine-tuning settings and the influence of the visual and textual encoders. All our data and checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/Wusiwei0410/SciMMIR.</description>

      <title>Mercury: A Code Efficiency Benchmark for Code Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07844v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amidst the recent strides in evaluating Large Language Models for Code (Code LLMs), existing benchmarks have mainly focused on the functional correctness of generated code, neglecting the importance of their computational efficiency. To fill the gap, we present Mercury, the first code efficiency benchmark for Code LLMs. It comprises 1,889 Python tasks, each accompanied by adequate solutions that serve as real-world efficiency baselines, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the runtime distribution. Based on the distribution, we introduce a new metric Beyond, which computes a runtime-percentile-weighted Pass score to reflect functional correctness and code efficiency simultaneously. On Mercury, leading Code LLMs can achieve 65% on Pass, while less than 50% on Beyond. Given that an ideal Beyond score would be aligned with the Pass score, it indicates that while Code LLMs exhibit impressive capabilities in generating functionally correct code, there remains a notable gap in their efficiency. Finally, our empirical experiments reveal that Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) serves as a robust baseline for enhancing code efficiency compared with Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT), which paves a promising avenue for future exploration of efficient code generation. Our code and data are available on GitHub: https://github.com/Elfsong/Mercury.</description>

      <title>Proving membership in LLM pretraining data via data watermarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting whether copyright holders' works were used in LLM pretraining is poised to be an important problem. This work proposes using data watermarks to enable principled detection with only black-box model access, provided that the rightholder contributed multiple training documents and watermarked them before public release. By applying a randomly sampled data watermark, detection can be framed as hypothesis testing, which provides guarantees on the false detection rate. We study two watermarks: one that inserts random sequences, and another that randomly substitutes characters with Unicode lookalikes. We first show how three aspects of watermark design -- watermark length, number of duplications, and interference -- affect the power of the hypothesis test. Next, we study how a watermark's detection strength changes under model and dataset scaling: while increasing the dataset size decreases the strength of the watermark, watermarks remain strong if the model size also increases. Finally, we view SHA hashes as natural watermarks and show that we can robustly detect hashes from BLOOM-176B's training data, as long as they occurred at least 90 times. Together, our results point towards a promising future for data watermarks in real world use.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Scientific Discovery with Generative Knowledge Extraction, Graph-Based Representation, and Multimodal Intelligent Graph Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), we have transformed a dataset comprising 1,000 scientific papers into an ontological knowledge graph. Through an in-depth structural analysis, we have calculated node degrees, identified communities and connectivities, and evaluated clustering coefficients and betweenness centrality of pivotal nodes, uncovering fascinating knowledge architectures. The graph has an inherently scale-free nature, is highly connected, and can be used for graph reasoning by taking advantage of transitive and isomorphic properties that reveal unprecedented interdisciplinary relationships that can be used to answer queries, identify gaps in knowledge, propose never-before-seen material designs, and predict material behaviors. We compute deep node embeddings for combinatorial node similarity ranking for use in a path sampling strategy links dissimilar concepts that have previously not been related. One comparison revealed structural parallels between biological materials and Beethoven's 9th Symphony, highlighting shared patterns of complexity through isomorphic mapping. In another example, the algorithm proposed a hierarchical mycelium-based composite based on integrating path sampling with principles extracted from Kandinsky's 'Composition VII' painting. The resulting material integrates an innovative set of concepts that include a balance of chaos/order, adjustable porosity, mechanical strength, and complex patterned chemical functionalization. We uncover other isomorphisms across science, technology and art, revealing a nuanced ontology of immanence that reveal a context-dependent heterarchical interplay of constituents. Graph-based generative AI achieves a far higher degree of novelty, explorative capacity, and technical detail, than conventional approaches and establishes a widely useful framework for innovation by revealing hidden connections.</description>

      <title>LangCell: Language-Cell Pre-training for Cell Identity Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06708v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cell identity encompasses various semantic aspects of a cell, including cell type, pathway information, disease information, and more, which are essential for biologists to gain insights into its biological characteristics. Understanding cell identity from the transcriptomic data, such as annotating cell types, has become an important task in bioinformatics. As these semantic aspects are determined by human experts, it is impossible for AI models to effectively carry out cell identity understanding tasks without the supervision signals provided by single-cell and label pairs. The single-cell pre-trained language models (PLMs) currently used for this task are trained only on a single modality, transcriptomics data, lack an understanding of cell identity knowledge. As a result, they have to be fine-tuned for downstream tasks and struggle when lacking labeled data with the desired semantic labels. To address this issue, we propose an innovative solution by constructing a unified representation of single-cell data and natural language during the pre-training phase, allowing the model to directly incorporate insights related to cell identity. More specifically, we introduce $\textbf{LangCell}$, the first $\textbf{Lang}$uage-$\textbf{Cell}$ pre-training framework. LangCell utilizes texts enriched with cell identity information to gain a profound comprehension of cross-modal knowledge. Results from experiments conducted on different benchmarks show that LangCell is the only single-cell PLM that can work effectively in zero-shot cell identity understanding scenarios, and also significantly outperforms existing models in few-shot and fine-tuning cell identity understanding scenarios.</description>

      <title>Eliciting Problem Specifications via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cognitive systems generally require a human to translate a problem definition into some specification that the cognitive system can use to attempt to solve the problem or perform the task. In this paper, we illustrate that large language models (LLMs) can be utilized to map a problem class, defined in natural language, into a semi-formal specification that can then be utilized by an existing reasoning and learning system to solve instances from the problem class. We present the design of LLM-enabled cognitive task analyst agent(s). Implemented with LLM agents, this system produces a definition of problem spaces for tasks specified in natural language. LLM prompts are derived from the definition of problem spaces in the AI literature and general problem-solving strategies (Polya's How to Solve It). A cognitive system can then use the problem-space specification, applying domain-general problem solving strategies ("weak methods" such as search), to solve multiple instances of problems from the problem class. This result, while preliminary, suggests the potential for speeding cognitive systems research via disintermediation of problem formulation while also retaining core capabilities of cognitive systems, such as robust inference and online learning.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Large Language Models for OpenAPI Code Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their utilization in code generation tasks have significantly reshaped the field of software development. Despite the remarkable efficacy of code completion solutions in mainstream programming languages, their performance lags when applied to less ubiquitous formats such as OpenAPI definitions. This study evaluates the OpenAPI completion performance of GitHub Copilot, a prevalent commercial code completion tool, and proposes a set of task-specific optimizations leveraging Meta's open-source model Code Llama. A semantics-aware OpenAPI completion benchmark proposed in this research is used to perform a series of experiments through which the impact of various prompt-engineering and fine-tuning techniques on the Code Llama model's performance is analyzed. The fine-tuned Code Llama model reaches a peak correctness improvement of 55.2% over GitHub Copilot despite utilizing 25 times fewer parameters than the commercial solution's underlying Codex model. Additionally, this research proposes an enhancement to a widely used code infilling training technique, addressing the issue of underperformance when the model is prompted with context sizes smaller than those used during training. The dataset, the benchmark, and the model fine-tuning code are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Hypernetworks for Personalizing ASR to Atypical Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for personalizing automatic speech recognition (ASR) has recently shown promise for adapting general population models to atypical speech. However, these approaches assume a priori knowledge of the atypical speech disorder being adapted for -- the diagnosis of which requires expert knowledge that is not always available. Even given this knowledge, data scarcity and high inter/intra-speaker variability further limit the effectiveness of traditional fine-tuning. To circumvent these challenges, we first identify the minimal set of model parameters required for ASR adaptation. Our analysis of each individual parameter's effect on adaptation performance allows us to reduce Word Error Rate (WER) by half while adapting 0.03% of all weights. Alleviating the need for cohort-specific models, we next propose the novel use of a meta-learned hypernetwork to generate highly individualized, utterance-level adaptations on-the-fly for a diverse set of atypical speech characteristics. Evaluating adaptation at the global, cohort and individual-level, we show that hypernetworks generalize better to out-of-distribution speakers, while maintaining an overall relative WER reduction of 75.2% using 0.1% of the full parameter budget.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) powered by language models have showcased remarkable capabilities in achieving naturalness and zero-shot voice cloning. Notably, the decoder-only transformer is the prominent architecture in this domain. However, transformers face challenges stemming from their quadratic complexity in sequence length, impeding training on lengthy sequences and resource-constrained hardware. Moreover they lack specific inductive bias with regards to the monotonic nature of TTS alignments. In response, we propose to replace transformers with emerging recurrent architectures and introduce specialized cross-attention mechanisms for reducing repeating and skipping issues. Consequently our architecture can be efficiently trained on long samples and achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot voice cloning against baselines of comparable size. Our implementation and demos are available at https://github.com/theodorblackbird/lina-speech.</description>

      <title>Turbo Sparse: Achieving LLM SOTA Performance with Minimal Activated Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploiting activation sparsity is a promising approach to significantly accelerating the inference process of large language models (LLMs) without compromising performance. However, activation sparsity is determined by activation functions, and commonly used ones like SwiGLU and GeGLU exhibit limited sparsity. Simply replacing these functions with ReLU fails to achieve sufficient sparsity. Moreover, inadequate training data can further increase the risk of performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel dReLU function, which is designed to improve LLM activation sparsity, along with a high-quality training data mixture ratio to facilitate effective sparsification. Additionally, we leverage sparse activation patterns within the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) experts of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models to further boost efficiency. By applying our neuron sparsification method to the Mistral and Mixtral models, only 2.5 billion and 4.3 billion parameters are activated per inference iteration, respectively, while achieving even more powerful model performance. Evaluation results demonstrate that this sparsity achieves a 2-5x decoding speedup. Remarkably, on mobile phones, our TurboSparse-Mixtral-47B achieves an inference speed of 11 tokens per second.

      <title>ShiftAddLLM: Accelerating Pretrained LLMs via Post-Training Multiplication-Less Reparameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on language tasks but face challenges when deployed on resource-constrained devices due to their extensive parameters and reliance on dense multiplications, resulting in high memory demands and latency bottlenecks. Shift-and-add reparameterization offers a promising solution by replacing costly multiplications with hardware-friendly primitives in both the attention and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers of an LLM. However, current reparameterization techniques require training from scratch or full parameter fine-tuning to restore accuracy, which is resource-intensive for LLMs. To address this, we propose accelerating pretrained LLMs through post-training shift-and-add reparameterization, creating efficient multiplication-free models, dubbed ShiftAddLLM. Specifically, we quantize each weight matrix into binary matrices paired with group-wise scaling factors. The associated multiplications are reparameterized into (1) shifts between activations and scaling factors and (2) queries and adds according to the binary matrices. To reduce accuracy loss, we present a multi-objective optimization method to minimize both weight and output activation reparameterization errors. Additionally, based on varying sensitivity across layers to reparameterization, we develop an automated bit allocation strategy to further reduce memory usage and latency. Experiments on five LLM families and eight tasks consistently validate the effectiveness of ShiftAddLLM, achieving average perplexity improvements of 5.6 and 22.7 points at comparable or lower latency compared to the most competitive quantized LLMs at 3 and 2 bits, respectively, and more than 80% memory and energy reductions over the original LLMs. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/GATECH-EIC/ShiftAddLLM.</description>

      <title>Transforming Wearable Data into Health Insights using Large Language Model Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the proliferation of wearable health trackers and the importance of sleep and exercise to health, deriving actionable personalized insights from wearable data remains a challenge because doing so requires non-trivial open-ended analysis of these data. The recent rise of large language model (LLM) agents, which can use tools to reason about and interact with the world, presents a promising opportunity to enable such personalized analysis at scale. Yet, the application of LLM agents in analyzing personal health is still largely untapped. In this paper, we introduce the Personal Health Insights Agent (PHIA), an agent system that leverages state-of-the-art code generation and information retrieval tools to analyze and interpret behavioral health data from wearables. We curate two benchmark question-answering datasets of over 4000 health insights questions. Based on 650 hours of human and expert evaluation we find that PHIA can accurately address over 84% of factual numerical questions and more than 83% of crowd-sourced open-ended questions. This work has implications for advancing behavioral health across the population, potentially enabling individuals to interpret their own wearable data, and paving the way for a new era of accessible, personalized wellness regimens that are informed by data-driven insights.</description>
