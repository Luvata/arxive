      <title>ScreenWriter: Automatic Screenplay Generation and Movie Summarisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of creative video content has driven demand for textual descriptions or summaries that allow users to recall key plot points or get an overview without watching. The volume of movie content and speed of turnover motivates automatic summarisation, which is nevertheless challenging, requiring identifying character intentions and very long-range temporal dependencies. The few existing methods attempting this task rely heavily on textual screenplays as input, greatly limiting their applicability. In this work, we propose the task of automatic screenplay generation, and a method, ScreenWriter, that operates only on video and produces output which includes dialogue, speaker names, scene breaks, and visual descriptions. ScreenWriter introduces a novel algorithm to segment the video into scenes based on the sequence of visual vectors, and a novel method for the challenging problem of determining character names, based on a database of actors' faces. We further demonstrate how these automatic screenplays can be used to generate plot synopses with a hierarchical summarisation method based on scene breaks. We test the quality of the final summaries on the recent MovieSum dataset, which we augment with videos, and show that they are superior to a number of comparison models which assume access to goldstandard screenplays.</description>

      <title>Step Guided Reasoning: Improving Mathematical Reasoning using Guidance Generation and Step Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical reasoning has been a challenging aspect of large language models (LLMs). However, the introduction of step-by-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) inference has significantly advanced the mathematical capabilities of LLMs. Despite this progress, current approaches either require massive inference datasets as training datasets or rely on few-shot methods that often sacrifice accuracy. To address this bottleneck in mathematical reasoning, we propose a novel method called Step Guidance Reasoning without involving further model fine-tuning. In this approach, LLMs reflect on small reasoning steps -- similar to how humans deliberate on and focus attention on what to do next. By incorporating this reflective process into the inference stage, LLMs can effectively guide their reasoning from one step to the next. Our method significantly improved the math performance, raising the accuracy on the AMC23 dataset from 30% to 57.5%, a relative improvement of 91.7%, and on the sampled level 5 problem of the MATH dataset, we achieved a relative accuracy improvement of 55.8%, increasing from 43% to 67%.</description>

      <title>Language Agents Meet Causality -- Bridging LLMs and Causal World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown great promise in planning and reasoning applications. These tasks demand robust systems, which arguably require a causal understanding of the environment. While LLMs can acquire and reflect common sense causal knowledge from their pretraining data, this information is often incomplete, incorrect, or inapplicable to a specific environment. In contrast, causal representation learning (CRL) focuses on identifying the underlying causal structure within a given environment. We propose a framework that integrates CRLs with LLMs to enable causally-aware reasoning and planning. This framework learns a causal world model, with causal variables linked to natural language expressions. This mapping provides LLMs with a flexible interface to process and generate descriptions of actions and states in text form. Effectively, the causal world model acts as a simulator that the LLM can query and interact with. We evaluate the framework on causal inference and planning tasks across temporal scales and environmental complexities. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, with the causally-aware method outperforming LLM-based reasoners, especially for longer planning horizons.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Strategic Planning Enhances Reasoning Capabilities in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for enabling them to tackle complex, multi-step problems. Multi-agent frameworks have shown great potential in enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities. However, the lack of effective cooperation between LLM agents hinders their performance, especially for multi-step reasoning tasks. This paper proposes a novel cooperative multi-agent reasoning framework (CoPlanner) by separating reasoning steps and assigning distinct duties to different agents. CoPlanner consists of two LLM agents: a planning agent and a reasoning agent. The planning agent provides high-level strategic hints, while the reasoning agent follows these hints and infers answers. By training the planning agent's policy through the interactive reasoning process via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), the LLaMA-3-8B-based CoPlanner outperforms the previous best method by 9.94\% on LogiQA and 3.09\% on BBH. Our results demonstrate that the guidance from the planning agent and the effective cooperation between the agents contribute to the superior performance of CoPlanner in tackling multi-step reasoning problems.</description>

      <title>MAD-Sherlock: Multi-Agent Debates for Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most challenging forms of misinformation involves the out-of-context (OOC) use of images paired with misleading text, creating false narratives. Existing AI-driven detection systems lack explainability and require expensive fine-tuning. We address these issues with MAD-Sherlock: a Multi-Agent Debate system for OOC Misinformation Detection. MAD-Sherlock introduces a novel multi-agent debate framework where multimodal agents collaborate to assess contextual consistency and request external information to enhance cross-context reasoning and decision-making. Our framework enables explainable detection with state-of-the-art accuracy even without domain-specific fine-tuning. Extensive ablation studies confirm that external retrieval significantly improves detection accuracy, and user studies demonstrate that MAD-Sherlock boosts performance for both experts and non-experts. These results position MAD-Sherlock as a powerful tool for autonomous and citizen intelligence applications.</description>

      <title>LLMs Can Evolve Continually on Modality for X-Modal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention due to their impressive capabilities in multimodal understanding. However, existing methods rely heavily on extensive modal-specific pretraining and joint-modal tuning, leading to significant computational burdens when expanding to new modalities. In this paper, we propose PathWeave, a flexible and scalable framework with modal-Path sWitching and ExpAnsion abilities that enables MLLMs to continually EVolve on modalities for $\mathbb{X}$-modal reasoning. We leverage the concept of Continual Learning and develop an incremental training strategy atop pre-trained MLLMs, enabling their expansion to new modalities using uni-modal data, without executing joint-modal pretraining. In detail, a novel Adapter-in-Adapter (AnA) framework is introduced, in which uni-modal and cross-modal adapters are seamlessly integrated to facilitate efficient modality alignment and collaboration. Additionally, an MoE-based gating module is applied between two types of adapters to further enhance the multimodal interaction. To investigate the proposed method, we establish a challenging benchmark called Continual Learning of Modality (MCL), which consists of high-quality QA data from five distinct modalities: image, video, audio, depth and point cloud. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AnA framework on learning plasticity and memory stability during continual learning. Furthermore, PathWeave performs comparably to state-of-the-art MLLMs while concurrently reducing parameter training burdens by 98.73%.

      <title>Rethinking the Uncertainty: A Critical Review and Analysis in the Era of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become fundamental to a broad spectrum of artificial intelligence applications. As the use of LLMs expands, precisely estimating the uncertainty in their predictions has become crucial. Current methods often struggle to accurately identify, measure, and address the true uncertainty, with many focusing primarily on estimating model confidence. This discrepancy is largely due to an incomplete understanding of where, when, and how uncertainties are injected into models. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework specifically designed to identify and understand the types and sources of uncertainty, aligned with the unique characteristics of LLMs. Our framework enhances the understanding of the diverse landscape of uncertainties by systematically categorizing and defining each type, establishing a solid foundation for developing targeted methods that can precisely quantify these uncertainties. We also provide a detailed introduction to key related concepts and examine the limitations of current methods in mission-critical and safety-sensitive applications. The paper concludes with a perspective on future directions aimed at enhancing the reliability and practical adoption of these methods in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>SWE-Search: Enhancing Software Agents with Monte Carlo Tree Search and Iterative Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software engineers operating in complex and dynamic environments must continuously adapt to evolving requirements, learn iteratively from experience, and reconsider their approaches based on new insights. However, current large language model (LLM)-based software agents often rely on rigid processes and tend to repeat ineffective actions without the capacity to evaluate their performance or adapt their strategies over time. To address these challenges, we propose SWE-Search, a multi-agent framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a self-improvement mechanism to enhance software agents' performance on repository-level software tasks. SWE-Search extends traditional MCTS by incorporating a hybrid value function that leverages LLMs for both numerical value estimation and qualitative evaluation. This enables self-feedback loops where agents iteratively refine their strategies based on both quantitative numerical evaluations and qualitative natural language assessments of pursued trajectories. The framework includes a SWE-Agent for adaptive exploration, a Value Agent for iterative feedback, and a Discriminator Agent that facilitates multi-agent debate for collaborative decision-making. Applied to the SWE-bench benchmark, our approach demonstrates a 23% relative improvement in performance across five models compared to standard open-source agents without MCTS. Our analysis reveals how performance scales with increased search depth and identifies key factors that facilitate effective self-evaluation in software agents. This work highlights the potential of self-evaluation driven search techniques to enhance agent reasoning and planning in complex, dynamic software engineering environments.</description>

      <title>Effective Instruction Parsing Plugin for Complex Logical Query Answering on Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Graph Query Embedding (KGQE) aims to embed First-Order Logic (FOL) queries in a low-dimensional KG space for complex reasoning over incomplete KGs. To enhance the generalization of KGQE models, recent studies integrate various external information (such as entity types and relation context) to better capture the logical semantics of FOL queries. The whole process is commonly referred to as Query Pattern Learning (QPL). However, current QPL methods typically suffer from the pattern-entity alignment bias problem, leading to the learned defective query patterns limiting KGQE models' performance. To address this problem, we propose an effective Query Instruction Parsing Plugin (QIPP) that leverages the context awareness of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to capture latent query patterns from code-like query instructions. Unlike the external information introduced by previous QPL methods, we first propose code-like instructions to express FOL queries in an alternative format. This format utilizes textual variables and nested tuples to convey the logical semantics within FOL queries, serving as raw materials for a PLM-based instruction encoder to obtain complete query patterns. Building on this, we design a query-guided instruction decoder to adapt query patterns to KGQE models. To further enhance QIPP's effectiveness across various KGQE models, we propose a query pattern injection mechanism based on compressed optimization boundaries and an adaptive normalization component, allowing KGQE models to utilize query patterns more efficiently. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our plug-and-play method improves the performance of eight basic KGQE models and outperforms two state-of-the-art QPL methods.</description>

      <title>AutoKaggle: A Multi-Agent Framework for Autonomous Data Science Competitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data science tasks involving tabular data present complex challenges that require sophisticated problem-solving approaches. We propose AutoKaggle, a powerful and user-centric framework that assists data scientists in completing daily data pipelines through a collaborative multi-agent system. AutoKaggle implements an iterative development process that combines code execution, debugging, and comprehensive unit testing to ensure code correctness and logic consistency. The framework offers highly customizable workflows, allowing users to intervene at each phase, thus integrating automated intelligence with human expertise. Our universal data science toolkit, comprising validated functions for data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling, forms the foundation of this solution, enhancing productivity by streamlining common tasks. We selected 8 Kaggle competitions to simulate data processing workflows in real-world application scenarios. Evaluation results demonstrate that AutoKaggle achieves a validation submission rate of 0.85 and a comprehensive score of 0.82 in typical data science pipelines, fully proving its effectiveness and practicality in handling complex data science tasks.</description>

      <title>Implementation and Application of an Intelligibility Protocol for Interaction with an LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our interest is in constructing interactive systems involving a human-expert interacting with a machine learning engine on data analysis tasks. This is of relevance when addressing complex problems arising in areas of science, the environment, medicine and so on, which are not immediately amenable to the usual methods of statistical or mathematical modelling. In such situations, it is possible that harnessing human expertise and creativity to modern machine-learning capabilities of identifying patterns by constructing new internal representations of the data may provide some insight to possible solutions. In this paper, we examine the implementation of an abstract protocol developed for interaction between agents, each capable of constructing predictions and explanations. The \PXP protocol, described in [12] is motivated by the notion of ''two-way intelligibility'' and is specified using a pair of communicating finite-state machines. While the formalisation allows the authors to prove several properties about the protocol, no implementation was presented. Here, we address this shortcoming for the case in which one of the agents acts as a ''generator'' using a large language model (LLM) and the other is an agent that acts as a ''tester'' using either a human-expert, or a proxy for a human-expert (for example, a database compiled using human-expertise). We believe these use-cases will be a widely applicable form of interaction for problems of the kind mentioned above. We present an algorithmic description of general-purpose implementation, and conduct preliminary experiments on its use in two different areas (radiology and drug-discovery). The experimental results provide early evidence in support of the protocol's capability of capturing one- and two-way intelligibility in human-LLM in the manner proposed in [12].</description>

      <title>Explainability in AI Based Applications: A Framework for Comparing Different Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence into business processes has significantly enhanced decision-making capabilities across various industries such as finance, healthcare, and retail. However, explaining the decisions made by these AI systems poses a significant challenge due to the opaque nature of recent deep learning models, which typically function as black boxes. To address this opacity, a multitude of explainability techniques have emerged. However, in practical business applications, the challenge lies in selecting an appropriate explainability method that balances comprehensibility with accuracy. This paper addresses the practical need of understanding differences in the output of explainability techniques by proposing a novel method for the assessment of the agreement of different explainability techniques. Based on our proposed methods, we provide a comprehensive comparative analysis of six leading explainability techniques to help guiding the selection of such techniques in practice. Our proposed general-purpose method is evaluated on top of one of the most popular deep learning architectures, the Vision Transformer model, which is frequently employed in business applications. Notably, we propose a novel metric to measure the agreement of explainability techniques that can be interpreted visually. By providing a practical framework for understanding the agreement of diverse explainability techniques, our research aims to facilitate the broader integration of interpretable AI systems in business applications.</description>

      <title>Active Causal Structure Learning with Latent Variables: Towards Learning to Detour in Autonomous Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) Agents and Robots must be able to cope with everchanging environments and tasks. They must be able to actively construct new internal causal models of their interactions with the environment when new structural changes take place in the environment. Thus, we claim that active causal structure learning with latent variables (ACSLWL) is a necessary component to build AGI agents and robots. This paper describes how a complex planning and expectation-based detour behavior can be learned by ACSLWL when, unexpectedly, and for the first time, the simulated robot encounters a sort of transparent barrier in its pathway towards its target. ACSWL consists of acting in the environment, discovering new causal relations, constructing new causal models, exploiting the causal models to maximize its expected utility, detecting possible latent variables when unexpected observations occur, and constructing new structures-internal causal models and optimal estimation of the associated parameters, to be able to cope efficiently with the new encountered situations. That is, the agent must be able to construct new causal internal models that transform a previously unexpected and inefficient (sub-optimal) situation, into a predictable situation with an optimal operating plan.</description>

      <title>FACTS: A Factored State-Space Framework For World Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: World modelling is essential for understanding and predicting the dynamics of complex systems by learning both spatial and temporal dependencies. However, current frameworks, such as Transformers and selective state-space models like Mambas, exhibit limitations in efficiently encoding spatial and temporal structures, particularly in scenarios requiring long-term high-dimensional sequence modelling. To address these issues, we propose a novel recurrent framework, the \textbf{FACT}ored \textbf{S}tate-space (\textbf{FACTS}) model, for spatial-temporal world modelling. The FACTS framework constructs a graph-structured memory with a routing mechanism that learns permutable memory representations, ensuring invariance to input permutations while adapting through selective state-space propagation. Furthermore, FACTS supports parallel computation of high-dimensional sequences. We empirically evaluate FACTS across diverse tasks, including multivariate time series forecasting and object-centric world modelling, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms or matches specialised state-of-the-art models, despite its general-purpose world modelling design.</description>

      <title>Active Legibility in Multiagent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multiagent sequential decision problem has been seen in many critical applications including urban transportation, autonomous driving cars, military operations, etc. Its widely known solution, namely multiagent reinforcement learning, has evolved tremendously in recent years. Among them, the solution paradigm of modeling other agents attracts our interest, which is different from traditional value decomposition or communication mechanisms. It enables agents to understand and anticipate others' behaviors and facilitates their collaboration. Inspired by recent research on the legibility that allows agents to reveal their intentions through their behavior, we propose a multiagent active legibility framework to improve their performance. The legibility-oriented framework allows agents to conduct legible actions so as to help others optimise their behaviors. In addition, we design a series of problem domains that emulate a common scenario and best characterize the legibility in multiagent reinforcement learning. The experimental results demonstrate that the new framework is more efficient and costs less training time compared to several multiagent reinforcement learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Neuro-symbolic Learning Yielding Logical Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuro-symbolic systems combine the abilities of neural perception and logical reasoning. However, end-to-end learning of neuro-symbolic systems is still an unsolved challenge. This paper proposes a natural framework that fuses neural network training, symbol grounding, and logical constraint synthesis into a coherent and efficient end-to-end learning process. The capability of this framework comes from the improved interactions between the neural and the symbolic parts of the system in both the training and inference stages. Technically, to bridge the gap between the continuous neural network and the discrete logical constraint, we introduce a difference-of-convex programming technique to relax the logical constraints while maintaining their precision. We also employ cardinality constraints as the language for logical constraint learning and incorporate a trust region method to avoid the degeneracy of logical constraint in learning. Both theoretical analyses and empirical evaluations substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Learning to Handle Complex Constraints for Vehicle Routing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) can model many real-world scenarios and often involve complex constraints. While recent neural methods excel in constructing solutions based on feasibility masking, they struggle with handling complex constraints, especially when obtaining the masking itself is NP-hard. In this paper, we propose a novel Proactive Infeasibility Prevention (PIP) framework to advance the capabilities of neural methods towards more complex VRPs. Our PIP integrates the Lagrangian multiplier as a basis to enhance constraint awareness and introduces preventative infeasibility masking to proactively steer the solution construction process. Moreover, we present PIP-D, which employs an auxiliary decoder and two adaptive strategies to learn and predict these tailored masks, potentially enhancing performance while significantly reducing computational costs during training. To verify our PIP designs, we conduct extensive experiments on the highly challenging Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Window (TSPTW), and TSP with Draft Limit (TSPDL) variants under different constraint hardness levels. Notably, our PIP is generic to boost many neural methods, and exhibits both a significant reduction in infeasible rate and a substantial improvement in solution quality.</description>

      <title>Towards Unifying Evaluation of Counterfactual Explanations: Leveraging Large Language Models for Human-Centric Assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As machine learning models evolve, maintaining transparency demands more human-centric explainable AI techniques. Counterfactual explanations, with roots in human reasoning, identify the minimal input changes needed to obtain a given output and, hence, are crucial for supporting decision-making. Despite their importance, the evaluation of these explanations often lacks grounding in user studies and remains fragmented, with existing metrics not fully capturing human perspectives. To address this challenge, we developed a diverse set of 30 counterfactual scenarios and collected ratings across 8 evaluation metrics from 206 respondents. Subsequently, we fine-tuned different Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict average or individual human judgment across these metrics. Our methodology allowed LLMs to achieve an accuracy of up to 63% in zero-shot evaluations and 85% (over a 3-classes prediction) with fine-tuning across all metrics. The fine-tuned models predicting human ratings offer better comparability and scalability in evaluating different counterfactual explanation frameworks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) is playing an increasingly important role in various AI systems. For e-commerce, an efficient and low-cost automated knowledge graph construction method is the foundation of enabling various successful downstream applications. In this paper, we propose a novel method for constructing structured product knowledge graphs from raw product images. The method cooperatively leverages recent advances in the vision-language model (VLM) and large language model (LLM), fully automating the process and allowing timely graph updates. We also present a human-annotated e-commerce product dataset for benchmarking product property extraction in knowledge graph construction. Our method outperforms our baseline in all metrics and evaluated properties, demonstrating its effectiveness and bright usage potential.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal AI for comprehensive breast cancer prognostication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Treatment selection in breast cancer is guided by molecular subtypes and clinical characteristics. Recurrence risk assessment plays a crucial role in personalizing treatment. Current methods, including genomic assays, have limited accuracy and clinical utility, leading to suboptimal decisions for many patients. We developed a test for breast cancer patient stratification based on digital pathology and clinical characteristics using novel AI methods. Specifically, we utilized a vision transformer-based pan-cancer foundation model trained with self-supervised learning to extract features from digitized H&amp;E-stained slides. These features were integrated with clinical data to form a multi-modal AI test predicting cancer recurrence and death. The test was developed and evaluated using data from a total of 8,161 breast cancer patients across 15 cohorts originating from seven countries. Of these, 3,502 patients from five cohorts were used exclusively for evaluation, while the remaining patients were used for training. Our test accurately predicted our primary endpoint, disease-free interval, in the five external cohorts (C-index: 0.71 [0.68-0.75], HR: 3.63 [3.02-4.37, p&lt;0.01]). In a direct comparison (N=858), the AI test was more accurate than Oncotype DX, the standard-of-care 21-gene assay, with a C-index of 0.67 [0.61-0.74] versus 0.61 [0.49-0.73], respectively. Additionally, the AI test added independent information to Oncotype DX in a multivariate analysis (HR: 3.11 [1.91-5.09, p&lt;0.01)]). The test demonstrated robust accuracy across all major breast cancer subtypes, including TNBC (C-index: 0.71 [0.62-0.81], HR: 3.81 [2.35-6.17, p=0.02]), where no diagnostic tools are currently recommended by clinical guidelines. These results suggest that our AI test can improve accuracy, extend applicability to a wider range of patients, and enhance access to treatment selection tools.</description>

      <title>Multi-view biomedical foundation models for molecule-target and property prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models applied to bio-molecular space hold promise to accelerate drug discovery. Molecular representation is key to building such models. Previous works have typically focused on a single representation or view of the molecules. Here, we develop a multi-view foundation model approach, that integrates molecular views of graph, image and text. Single-view foundation models are each pre-trained on a dataset of up to 200M molecules and then aggregated into combined representations. Our multi-view model is validated on a diverse set of 18 tasks, encompassing ligand-protein binding, molecular solubility, metabolism and toxicity. We show that the multi-view models perform robustly and are able to balance the strengths and weaknesses of specific views. We then apply this model to screen compounds against a large (&gt;100 targets) set of G Protein-Coupled receptors (GPCRs). From this library of targets, we identify 33 that are related to Alzheimer's disease. On this subset, we employ our model to identify strong binders, which are validated through structure-based modeling and identification of key binding motifs.</description>

      <title>Tourism destination events classifier based on artificial intelligence techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying client needs to provide optimal services is crucial in tourist destination management. The events held in tourist destinations may help to meet those needs and thus contribute to tourist satisfaction. As with product management, the creation of hierarchical catalogs to classify those events can aid event management. The events that can be found on the internet are listed in dispersed, heterogeneous sources, which makes direct classification a difficult, time-consuming task. The main aim of this work is to create a novel process for automatically classifying an eclectic variety of tourist events using a hierarchical taxonomy, which can be applied to support tourist destination management. Leveraging data science methods such as CRISP-DM, supervised machine learning, and natural language processing techniques, the automatic classification process proposed here allows the creation of a normalized catalog across very different geographical regions. Therefore, we can build catalogs with consistent filters, allowing users to find events regardless of the event categories assigned at source, if any. This is very valuable for companies that offer this kind of information across multiple regions, such as airlines, travel agencies or hotel chains. Ultimately, this tool has the potential to revolutionize the way companies and end users interact with tourist events information.</description>

      <title>SALINA: Towards Sustainable Live Sonar Analytics in Wild Ecosystems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sonar radar captures visual representations of underwater objects and structures using sound wave reflections, making it essential for exploration, mapping, and continuous surveillance in wild ecosystems. Real-time analysis of sonar data is crucial for time-sensitive applications, including environmental anomaly detection and in-season fishery management, where rapid decision-making is needed. However, the lack of both relevant datasets and pre-trained DNN models, coupled with resource limitations in wild environments, hinders the effective deployment and continuous operation of live sonar analytics.
  We present SALINA, a sustainable live sonar analytics system designed to address these challenges. SALINA enables real-time processing of acoustic sonar data with spatial and temporal adaptations, and features energy-efficient operation through a robust energy management module. Deployed for six months at two inland rivers in British Columbia, Canada, SALINA provided continuous 24/7 underwater monitoring, supporting fishery stewardship and wildlife restoration efforts. Through extensive real-world testing, SALINA demonstrated an up to 9.5% improvement in average precision and a 10.1% increase in tracking metrics. The energy management module successfully handled extreme weather, preventing outages and reducing contingency costs. These results offer valuable insights for long-term deployment of acoustic data systems in the wild.</description>

      <title>AppBench: Planning of Multiple APIs from Various APPs for Complex User Instruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can interact with the real world by connecting with versatile external APIs, resulting in better problem-solving and task automation capabilities. Previous research primarily focuses on APIs with limited arguments from a single source or overlooks the complex dependency relationship between different APIs. However, it is essential to utilize multiple APIs collaboratively from various sources (e.g., different Apps in the iPhone), especially for complex user instructions. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{AppBench}, the first benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to plan and execute multiple APIs from various sources in order to complete the user's task. Specifically, we consider two significant challenges in multiple APIs: \textit{1) graph structures:} some APIs can be executed independently while others need to be executed one by one, resulting in graph-like execution order; and \textit{2) permission constraints:} which source is authorized to execute the API call. We have experimental results on 9 distinct LLMs; e.g., GPT-4o achieves only a 2.0\% success rate at the most complex instruction, revealing that the existing state-of-the-art LLMs still cannot perform well in this situation even with the help of in-context learning and finetuning. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/ruleGreen/AppBench.</description>

      <title>Towards Next-Generation LLM-based Recommender Systems: A Survey and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have not only revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) but also have the potential to bring a paradigm shift in many other fields due to their remarkable abilities of language understanding, as well as impressive generalization capabilities and reasoning skills. As a result, recent studies have actively attempted to harness the power of LLMs to improve recommender systems, and it is imperative to thoroughly review the recent advances and challenges of LLM-based recommender systems. Unlike existing work, this survey does not merely analyze the classifications of LLM-based recommendation systems according to the technical framework of LLMs. Instead, it investigates how LLMs can better serve recommendation tasks from the perspective of the recommender system community, thus enhancing the integration of large language models into the research of recommender system and its practical application. In addition, the long-standing gap between academic research and industrial applications related to recommender systems has not been well discussed, especially in the era of large language models. In this review, we introduce a novel taxonomy that originates from the intrinsic essence of recommendation, delving into the application of large language model-based recommendation systems and their industrial implementation. Specifically, we propose a three-tier structure that more accurately reflects the developmental progression of recommendation systems from research to practical implementation, including representing and understanding, scheming and utilizing, and industrial deployment. Furthermore, we discuss critical challenges and opportunities in this emerging field.

Abstract: Efficient physics simulations are essential for numerous applications, ranging from realistic cloth animations or smoke effects in video games, to analyzing pollutant dispersion in environmental sciences, to calculating vehicle drag coefficients in engineering applications. Unfortunately, analytical solutions to the underlying physical equations are rarely available, and numerical solutions require high computational resources. Latest developments in the field of physics-based Deep Learning have led to promising efficiency improvements but still suffer from limited generalization capabilities and low accuracy compared to numerical solvers.
  In this work, we introduce Metamizer, a novel neural optimizer that iteratively solves a wide range of physical systems with high accuracy by minimizing a physics-based loss function. To this end, our approach leverages a scale-invariant architecture that enhances gradient descent updates to accelerate convergence. Since the neural network itself acts as an optimizer, training this neural optimizer falls into the category of meta-optimization approaches.
  We demonstrate that Metamizer achieves unprecedented accuracy for deep learning based approaches - sometimes approaching machine precision - across multiple PDEs after training on the Laplace, advection-diffusion and incompressible Navier-Stokes equation as well as on cloth simulations. Remarkably, the model also generalizes to PDEs that were not covered during training such as the Poisson, wave and Burgers equation.
  Our results suggest that Metamizer could have a profound impact on future numerical solvers, paving the way for fast and accurate neural physics simulations without the need for retraining.</description>

      <title>C^2DA: Contrastive and Context-aware Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptive semantic segmentation (UDA-SS) aims to train a model on the source domain data (e.g., synthetic) and adapt the model to predict target domain data (e.g., real-world) without accessing target annotation data. Most existing UDA-SS methods only focus on inter-domain knowledge to mitigate the data-shift problem. However, learning the inherent structure of the images and exploring the intrinsic pixel distribution of both domains are ignored, which prevents the UDA-SS methods from producing satisfactory performance like supervised learning. Moreover, incorporating contextual knowledge is also often overlooked. Considering these issues, in this work, we propose a UDA-SS framework that learns both intra-domain and context-aware knowledge. To learn the intra-domain knowledge, we incorporate contrastive loss in both domains, which pulls pixels of similar classes together and pushes the rest away, facilitating intra-image-pixel-wise correlations. To learn context-aware knowledge, we modify the mixing technique by leveraging contextual dependency among the classes. Moreover, we adapt the Mask Image Modeling (MIM) technique to properly use context clues for robust visual recognition, using limited information about the masked images. Comprehensive experiments validate that our proposed method improves the state-of-the-art UDA-SS methods by a margin of 0.51% mIoU and 0.54% mIoU in the adaptation of GTA-V-&gt;Cityscapes and Synthia-&gt;Cityscapes, respectively. We open-source our C2DA code. Code link: github.com/Masrur02/C-Squared-DA</description>

      <title>Using AI Alignment Theory to understand the potential pitfalls of regulatory frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper leverages insights from Alignment Theory (AT) research, which primarily focuses on the potential pitfalls of technical alignment in Artificial Intelligence, to critically examine the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act). In the context of AT research, several key failure modes - such as proxy gaming, goal drift, reward hacking or specification gaming - have been identified. These can arise when AI systems are not properly aligned with their intended objectives. The central logic of this report is: what can we learn if we treat regulatory efforts in the same way as we treat advanced AI systems? As we systematically apply these concepts to the EU AI Act, we uncover potential vulnerabilities and areas for improvement in the regulation.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Concepts: Sparse Autoencoder Feature Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders have recently produced dictionaries of high-dimensional vectors corresponding to the universe of concepts represented by large language models. We find that this concept universe has interesting structure at three levels: 1) The "atomic" small-scale structure contains "crystals" whose faces are parallelograms or trapezoids, generalizing well-known examples such as (man-woman-king-queen). We find that the quality of such parallelograms and associated function vectors improves greatly when projecting out global distractor directions such as word length, which is efficiently done with linear discriminant analysis. 2) The "brain" intermediate-scale structure has significant spatial modularity; for example, math and code features form a "lobe" akin to functional lobes seen in neural fMRI images. We quantify the spatial locality of these lobes with multiple metrics and find that clusters of co-occurring features, at coarse enough scale, also cluster together spatially far more than one would expect if feature geometry were random. 3) The "galaxy" scale large-scale structure of the feature point cloud is not isotropic, but instead has a power law of eigenvalues with steepest slope in middle layers. We also quantify how the clustering entropy depends on the layer.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis on Ethical Benchmarking in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work contributes to the field of Machine Ethics (ME) benchmarking, which develops tests to assess whether intelligent systems accurately represent human values and act accordingly. We identify three major issues with current ME benchmarks: limited ecological validity due to unrealistic ethical dilemmas, unstructured question generation without clear inclusion/exclusion criteria, and a lack of scalability due to reliance on human annotations. Moreover, benchmarks often fail to include sufficient syntactic variations, reducing the robustness of findings. To address these gaps, we introduce two new ME benchmarks: the Triage Benchmark and the Medical Law (MedLaw) Benchmark, both featuring real-world ethical dilemmas from the medical domain. The MedLaw Benchmark, fully AI-generated, offers a scalable alternative. We also introduce context perturbations in our benchmarks to assess models' worst-case performance. Our findings reveal that ethics prompting does not always improve decision-making. Furthermore, context perturbations not only significantly reduce model performance but can also reverse error patterns and shift relative performance rankings. Lastly, our comparison of worst-case performance suggests that general model capability does not always predict strong ethical decision-making. We argue that ME benchmarks must approximate real-world scenarios and worst-case performance to ensure robust evaluation.</description>

      <title>A SAM based Tool for Semi-Automatic Food Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in food and nutrition research is hindered by a critical bottleneck: the lack of annotated food data. Despite the rise of highly efficient AI models designed for tasks such as food segmentation and classification, their practical application might necessitate proficiency in AI and machine learning principles, which can act as a challenge for non-AI experts in the field of nutritional sciences. Alternatively, it highlights the need to translate AI models into user-friendly tools that are accessible to all. To address this, we present a demo of a semi-automatic food image annotation tool leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The tool enables prompt-based food segmentation via user interactions, promoting user engagement and allowing them to further categorise food items within meal images and specify weight/volume if necessary. Additionally, we release a fine-tuned version of SAM's mask decoder, dubbed MealSAM, with the ViT-B backbone tailored specifically for food image segmentation. Our objective is not only to contribute to the field by encouraging participation, collaboration, and the gathering of more annotated food data but also to make AI technology available for a broader audience by translating AI into practical tools.</description>

      <title>PINNing Cerebral Blood Flow: Analysis of Perfusion MRI in Infants using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables cerebral perfusion measurement, which is crucial in detecting and managing neurological issues in infants born prematurely or after perinatal complications. However, cerebral blood flow (CBF) estimation in infants using ASL remains challenging due to the complex interplay of network physiology, involving dynamic interactions between cardiac output and cerebral perfusion, as well as issues with parameter uncertainty and data noise. We propose a new spatial uncertainty-based physics-informed neural network (PINN), SUPINN, to estimate CBF and other parameters from infant ASL data. SUPINN employs a multi-branch architecture to concurrently estimate regional and global model parameters across multiple voxels. It computes regional spatial uncertainties to weigh the signal. SUPINN can reliably estimate CBF (relative error $-0.3 \pm 71.7$), bolus arrival time (AT) ($30.5 \pm 257.8$), and blood longitudinal relaxation time ($T_{1b}$) ($-4.4 \pm 28.9$), surpassing parameter estimates performed using least squares or standard PINNs. Furthermore, SUPINN produces physiologically plausible spatially smooth CBF and AT maps. Our study demonstrates the successful modification of PINNs for accurate multi-parameter perfusion estimation from noisy and limited ASL data in infants. Frameworks like SUPINN have the potential to advance our understanding of the complex cardio-brain network physiology, aiding in the detection and management of diseases.

      <title>Movie Trailer Genre Classification Using Multimodal Pretrained Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for movie genre classification, capitalizing on a diverse set of readily accessible pretrained models. These models extract high-level features related to visual scenery, objects, characters, text, speech, music, and audio effects. To intelligently fuse these pretrained features, we train small classifier models with low time and memory requirements. Employing the transformer model, our approach utilizes all video and audio frames of movie trailers without performing any temporal pooling, efficiently exploiting the correspondence between all elements, as opposed to the fixed and low number of frames typically used by traditional methods. Our approach fuses features originating from different tasks and modalities, with different dimensionalities, different temporal lengths, and complex dependencies as opposed to current approaches. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art movie genre classification models in terms of precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP). To foster future research, we make the pretrained features for the entire MovieNet dataset, along with our genre classification code and the trained models, publicly available.</description>

      <title>Reliable, Routable, and Reproducible: Collection of Pedestrian Pathways at Statewide Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While advances in mobility technology including autonomous vehicles and multi-modal navigation systems can improve mobility equity for people with disabilities, these technologies depend crucially on accurate, standardized, and complete pedestrian path networks. Ad hoc collection efforts lead to a data record that is sparse, unreliable, and non-interoperable.
  This paper presents a sociotechnical methodology to collect, manage, serve, and maintain pedestrian path data at a statewide scale. Combining the automation afforded by computer-vision approaches applied to aerial imagery and existing road network data with the quality control afforded by interactive tools, we aim to produce routable pedestrian pathways for the entire State of Washington within approximately two years. We extract paths, crossings, and curb ramps at scale from aerial imagery, integrating multi-input segmentation methods with road topology data to ensure connected, routable networks. We then organize the predictions into project regions selected for their value to the public interest, where each project region is divided into intersection-scale tasks. These tasks are assigned and tracked through an interactive tool that manages concurrency, progress, feedback, and data management.
  We demonstrate that our automated systems outperform state-of-the-art methods in producing routable pathway networks, which then significantly reduces the time required for human vetting. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of yielding accurate, robust pedestrian pathway networks at the scale of an entire state.
  This paper intends to inform procedures for national-scale ADA compliance by providing pedestrian equity, safety, and accessibility, and improving urban environments for all users.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Movie Genres through Cross-Attention Fusion of Bi-Modal Synergy of Poster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movie posters are not just decorative; they are meticulously designed to capture the essence of a movie, such as its genre, storyline, and tone/vibe. For decades, movie posters have graced cinema walls, billboards, and now our digital screens as a form of digital posters. Movie genre classification plays a pivotal role in film marketing, audience engagement, and recommendation systems. Previous explorations into movie genre classification have been mostly examined in plot summaries, subtitles, trailers and movie scenes. Movie posters provide a pre-release tantalizing glimpse into a film's key aspects, which can ignite public interest. In this paper, we presented the framework that exploits movie posters from a visual and textual perspective to address the multilabel movie genre classification problem. Firstly, we extracted text from movie posters using an OCR and retrieved the relevant embedding. Next, we introduce a cross-attention-based fusion module to allocate attention weights to visual and textual embedding. In validating our framework, we utilized 13882 posters sourced from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). The outcomes of the experiments indicate that our model exhibited promising performance and outperformed even some prominent contemporary architectures.</description>

      <title>Real-time Monitoring of Lower Limb Movement Resistance Based on Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time lower limb movement resistance monitoring is critical for various applications in clinical and sports settings, such as rehabilitation and athletic training. Current methods often face limitations in accuracy, computational efficiency, and generalizability, which hinder their practical implementation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Mobile Multi-Task Learning Network (MMTL-Net) that integrates MobileNetV3 for efficient feature extraction and employs multi-task learning to simultaneously predict resistance levels and recognize activities. The advantages of MMTL-Net include enhanced accuracy, reduced latency, and improved computational efficiency, making it highly suitable for real-time applications. Experimental results demonstrate that MMTL-Net significantly outperforms existing models on the UCI Human Activity Recognition and Wireless Sensor Data Mining Activity Prediction datasets, achieving a lower Force Error Rate (FER) of 6.8% and a higher Resistance Prediction Accuracy (RPA) of 91.2%. Additionally, the model shows a Real-time Responsiveness (RTR) of 12 milliseconds and a Throughput (TP) of 33 frames per second. These findings underscore the model's robustness and effectiveness in diverse real-world scenarios. The proposed framework not only advances the state-of-the-art in resistance monitoring but also paves the way for more efficient and accurate systems in clinical and sports applications. In real-world settings, the practical implications of MMTL-Net include its potential to enhance patient outcomes in rehabilitation and improve athletic performance through precise, real-time monitoring and feedback.</description>

      <title>Copula-Linked Parallel ICA: A Method for Coupling Structural and Functional MRI brain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different brain imaging modalities offer unique insights into brain function and structure. Combining them enhances our understanding of neural mechanisms. Prior multimodal studies fusing functional MRI (fMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI) have shown the benefits of this approach. Since sMRI lacks temporal data, existing fusion methods often compress fMRI temporal information into summary measures, sacrificing rich temporal dynamics. Motivated by the observation that covarying networks are identified in both sMRI and resting-state fMRI, we developed a novel fusion method, by combining deep learning frameworks, copulas and independent component analysis (ICA), named copula linked parallel ICA (CLiP-ICA). This method estimates independent sources for each modality and links the spatial sources of fMRI and sMRI using a copula-based model for more flexible integration of temporal and spatial data. We tested CLiP-ICA using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our results showed that CLiP-ICA effectively captures both strongly and weakly linked sMRI and fMRI networks, including the cerebellum, sensorimotor, visual, cognitive control, and default mode networks. It revealed more meaningful components and fewer artifacts, addressing the long-standing issue of optimal model order in ICA. CLiP-ICA also detected complex functional connectivity patterns across stages of cognitive decline, with cognitively normal subjects generally showing higher connectivity in sensorimotor and visual networks compared to patients with Alzheimer, along with patterns suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Gender Bias of LLM in Economics: An Existentialism Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and BERT, have rapidly gained traction in natural language processing (NLP) and are now integral to financial decision-making. However, their deployment introduces critical challenges, particularly in perpetuating gender biases that can distort decision-making outcomes in high-stakes economic environments. This paper investigates gender bias in LLMs through both mathematical proofs and empirical experiments using the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT), demonstrating that LLMs inherently reinforce gender stereotypes even without explicit gender markers. By comparing the decision-making processes of humans and LLMs, we reveal fundamental differences: while humans can override biases through ethical reasoning and individualized understanding, LLMs maintain bias as a rational outcome of their mathematical optimization on biased data. Our analysis proves that bias in LLMs is not an unintended flaw but a systematic result of their rational processing, which tends to preserve and amplify existing societal biases encoded in training data. Drawing on existentialist theory, we argue that LLM-generated bias reflects entrenched societal structures and highlights the limitations of purely technical debiasing methods. This research underscores the need for new theoretical frameworks and interdisciplinary methodologies that address the ethical implications of integrating LLMs into economic and financial decision-making. We advocate for a reconceptualization of how LLMs influence economic decisions, emphasizing the importance of incorporating human-like ethical considerations into AI governance to ensure fairness and equity in AI-driven financial systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-driven Mobile Traffic Measurement Collection and Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling dynamic traffic patterns and especially the continuously changing dependencies between different base stations, which previous studies overlook, is challenging. Traditional algorithms struggle to process large volumes of data and to extract deep insights that help elucidate mobile traffic demands with fine granularity, as well as how these demands will evolve in the future. Therefore, in this thesis we harness the powerful hierarchical feature learning abilities of Deep Learning (DL) techniques in both spatial and temporal domains and develop solutions for precise city-scale mobile traffic analysis and forecasting. Firstly, we design Spider, a mobile traffic measurement collection and reconstruction framework with a view to reducing the cost of measurement collection and inferring traffic consumption with high accuracy, despite working with sparse information. In particular, we train a reinforcement learning agent to selectively sample subsets of target mobile coverage areas and tackle the large action space problem specific to this setting. We then introduce a lightweight neural network model to reconstruct the traffic consumption based on historical sparse measurements. Our proposed framework outperforms existing solutions on a real-world mobile traffic dataset. Secondly, we design SDGNet, a handover-aware graph neural network model for long-term mobile traffic forecasting. We model the cellular network as a graph, and leverage handover frequency to capture the dependencies between base stations across time. Handover information reflects user mobility such as daily commute, which helps in increasing the accuracy of the forecasts made. We proposed dynamic graph convolution to extract features from both traffic consumption and handover data, showing that our model outperforms other benchmark graph models on a mobile traffic dataset collected by a major network operator.</description>

      <title>Xeno-learning: knowledge transfer across species in deep learning-based spectral image analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novel optical imaging techniques, such as hyperspectral imaging (HSI) combined with machine learning-based (ML) analysis, have the potential to revolutionize clinical surgical imaging. However, these novel modalities face a shortage of large-scale, representative clinical data for training ML algorithms, while preclinical animal data is abundantly available through standardized experiments and allows for controlled induction of pathological tissue states, which is not ethically possible in patients. To leverage this situation, we propose a novel concept called "xeno-learning", a cross-species knowledge transfer paradigm inspired by xeno-transplantation, where organs from a donor species are transplanted into a recipient species. Using a total of 11,268 HSI images from humans as well as porcine and rat models, we show that although spectral signatures of organs differ across species, shared pathophysiological mechanisms manifest as comparable relative spectral changes across species. Such changes learnt in one species can thus be transferred to a new species via a novel "physiology-based data augmentation" method, enabling the large-scale secondary use of preclinical animal data for humans. The resulting ethical, monetary, and performance benefits of the proposed knowledge transfer paradigm promise a high impact of the methodology on future developments in the field.</description>

      <title>Single-word Auditory Attention Decoding Using Deep Learning Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying auditory attention by comparing auditory stimuli and corresponding brain responses, is known as auditory attention decoding (AAD). The majority of AAD algorithms utilize the so-called envelope entrainment mechanism, whereby auditory attention is identified by how the envelope of the auditory stream drives variation in the electroencephalography (EEG) signal. However, neural processing can also be decoded based on endogenous cognitive responses, in this case, neural responses evoked by attention to specific words in a speech stream. This approach is largely unexplored in the field of AAD but leads to a single-word auditory attention decoding problem in which an epoch of an EEG signal timed to a specific word is labeled as attended or unattended. This paper presents a deep learning approach, based on EEGNet, to address this challenge. We conducted a subject-independent evaluation on an event-based AAD dataset with three different paradigms: word category oddball, word category with competing speakers, and competing speech streams with targets. The results demonstrate that the adapted model is capable of exploiting cognitive-related spatiotemporal EEG features and achieving at least 58% accuracy on the most realistic competing paradigm for the unseen subjects. To our knowledge, this is the first study dealing with this problem.</description>

      <title>First-Person Fairness in Chatbots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chatbots like ChatGPT are used for diverse purposes, ranging from resume writing to entertainment. These real-world applications are different from the institutional uses, such as resume screening or credit scoring, which have been the focus of much of AI research on fairness. Ensuring equitable treatment for all users in these first-person contexts is critical. In this work, we study "first-person fairness," which means fairness toward the chatbot user. This includes providing high-quality responses to all users regardless of their identity or background and avoiding harmful stereotypes.
  We propose a scalable, privacy-preserving method for evaluating one aspect of first-person fairness across a large, heterogeneous corpus of real-world chatbot interactions. Specifically, we assess potential bias linked to users' names, which can serve as proxies for demographic attributes like gender or race, in chatbot systems such as ChatGPT, which provide mechanisms for storing and using user names. Our method leverages a second language model to privately analyze name-sensitivity in the chatbot's responses. We verify the validity of these annotations through independent human evaluation. Further, we show that post-training interventions, including RL, significantly mitigate harmful stereotypes.
  Our approach also yields succinct descriptions of response differences across tasks. For instance, in the "writing a story" task, chatbot responses show a tendency to create protagonists whose gender matches the likely gender inferred from the user's name. Moreover, a pattern emerges where users with female-associated names receive responses with friendlier and simpler language slightly more often than users with male-associated names. Finally, we provide the system messages required for external researchers to further investigate ChatGPT's behavior with hypothetical user profiles.</description>

In this work we propose LocateBench, a high-quality benchmark dedicated to evaluating this ability.

      <title>ControlAgent: Automating Control System Design via Novel Integration of LLM Agents and Domain Expertise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control system design is a crucial aspect of modern engineering with far-reaching applications across diverse sectors including aerospace, automotive systems, power grids, and robotics. Despite advances made by Large Language Models (LLMs) in various domains, their application in control system design remains limited due to the complexity and specificity of control theory. To bridge this gap, we introduce ControlAgent, a new paradigm that automates control system design via novel integration of LLM agents and control-oriented domain expertise. ControlAgent encodes expert control knowledge and emulates human iterative design processes by gradually tuning controller parameters to meet user-specified requirements for stability, performance, and robustness. ControlAgent integrates multiple collaborative LLM agents, including a central agent responsible for task distribution and task-specific agents dedicated to detailed controller design for various types of systems and requirements. ControlAgent also employs a Python computation agent that performs complex calculations and controller evaluations based on standard design information provided by task-specified LLM agents. Combined with a history and feedback module, the task-specific LLM agents iteratively refine controller parameters based on real-time feedback from prior designs. Overall, ControlAgent mimics the design processes used by (human) practicing engineers, but removes all the human efforts and can be run in a fully automated way to give end-to-end solutions for control system design with user-specified requirements. To validate ControlAgent's effectiveness, we develop ControlEval, an evaluation dataset that comprises 500 control tasks with various specific design goals. The effectiveness of ControlAgent is demonstrated via extensive comparative evaluations between LLM-based and traditional human-involved toolbox-based baselines.</description>

      <title>UniMTS: Unified Pre-training for Motion Time Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion time series collected from mobile and wearable devices such as smartphones and smartwatches offer significant insights into human behavioral patterns, with wide applications in healthcare, automation, IoT, and AR/XR due to their low-power, always-on nature. However, given security and privacy concerns, building large-scale motion time series datasets remains difficult, preventing the development of pre-trained models for human activity analysis. Typically, existing models are trained and tested on the same dataset, leading to poor generalizability across variations in device location, device mounting orientation and human activity type. In this paper, we introduce UniMTS, the first unified pre-training procedure for motion time series that generalizes across diverse device latent factors and activities. Specifically, we employ a contrastive learning framework that aligns motion time series with text descriptions enriched by large language models. This helps the model learn the semantics of time series to generalize across activities. Given the absence of large-scale motion time series data, we derive and synthesize time series from existing motion skeleton data with all-joint coverage. Spatio-temporal graph networks are utilized to capture the relationships across joints for generalization across different device locations. We further design rotation-invariant augmentation to make the model agnostic to changes in device mounting orientations. Our model shows exceptional generalizability across 18 motion time series classification benchmark datasets, outperforming the best baselines by 340% in the zero-shot setting, 16.3% in the few-shot setting, and 9.2% in the full-shot setting.</description>

      <title>GNNRL-Smoothing: A Prior-Free Reinforcement Learning Model for Mesh Smoothing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mesh smoothing methods can enhance mesh quality by eliminating distorted elements, leading to improved convergence in simulations. To balance the efficiency and robustness of traditional mesh smoothing process, previous approaches have employed supervised learning and reinforcement learning to train intelligent smoothing models. However, these methods heavily rely on labeled dataset or prior knowledge to guide the models' learning. Furthermore, their limited capacity to enhance mesh connectivity often restricts the effectiveness of smoothing. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the learning mechanisms of recent intelligent smoothing methods and propose a prior-free reinforcement learning model for intelligent mesh smoothing. Our proposed model integrates graph neural networks with reinforcement learning to implement an intelligent node smoothing agent and introduces, for the first time, a mesh connectivity improvement agent. We formalize mesh optimization as a Markov Decision Process and successfully train both agents using Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Double Dueling Deep Q-Network in the absence of any prior data or knowledge. We verified the proposed model on both 2D and 3D meshes. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves feature-preserving smoothing on complex 3D surface meshes. It also achieves state-of-the-art results among intelligent smoothing methods on 2D meshes and is 7.16 times faster than traditional optimization-based smoothing methods. Moreover, the connectivity improvement agent can effectively enhance the quality distribution of the mesh.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the complex dynamics of high-dimensional, contingent, and strongly nonlinear economic data, often shaped by multiplicative processes, poses significant challenges for traditional regression methods as such methods offer limited capacity to capture the structural changes they feature. To address this, we propose leveraging the potential of knowledge graph embeddings for economic trade data, in particular, to predict international trade relationships. We implement KonecoKG, a knowledge graph representation of economic trade data with multidimensional relationships using SDM-RDFizer, and transform the relationships into a knowledge graph embedding using AmpliGraph.</description>

Abstract: Recognizing a traffic signal, determining if the signal is green or red, and figuring out the time left to cross the crosswalk are significant challenges to visually impaired people. Previous research has focused on recognizing only two traffic signals, green and red lights, using machine learning techniques. The proposed method developed a GreenEye system that recognizes the traffic signals' color and tells the time left for pedestrians to cross the crosswalk in real-time. GreenEye's first training showed the highest precision of 74.6%; four classes reported 40% or lower recognition precision in this training session. The data imbalance caused low precision; thus, extra labeling and database formation were performed to stabilize the number of images between different classes. After the stabilization, all 14 classes showed excelling precision rate of 99.5%.</description>

Abstract: Digital payment systems have revolutionized financial transactions, offering unparalleled convenience and accessibility to users worldwide. However, the increasing popularity of these platforms has also attracted malicious actors seeking to exploit their vulnerabilities for financial gain. To address this challenge, robust and adaptable scam detection mechanisms are crucial for maintaining the trust and safety of digital payment ecosystems. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to scam detection, focusing on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in India, Google Pay (GPay) as a specific use case. The approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance scam classification accuracy and designs a digital assistant to aid human reviewers in identifying and mitigating fraudulent activities. The results demonstrate the potential of LLMs in augmenting existing machine learning models and improving the efficiency, accuracy, quality, and consistency of scam reviews, ultimately contributing to a safer and more secure digital payment landscape. Our evaluation of the Gemini Ultra model on curated transaction data showed a 93.33% accuracy in scam classification. Furthermore, the model demonstrated 89% accuracy in generating reasoning for these classifications. A promising fact, the model identified 32% new accurate reasons for suspected scams that human reviewers had not included in the review notes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for accurate diagnosisand treatment planning, but the small size and irregular shapeof tumors pose significant challenges. Existing methods of-ten fail to effectively incorporate medical domain knowledgesuch as tumor grade, which correlates with tumor aggres-siveness and morphology, providing critical insights for moreaccurate detection of tumor subregions during segmentation.We propose an Automated and Editable Prompt Learning(AEPL) framework that integrates tumor grade into the seg-mentation process by combining multi-task learning andprompt learning with automatic and editable prompt gen-eration. Specifically, AEPL employs an encoder to extractimage features for both tumor-grade prediction and segmen-tation mask generation. The predicted tumor grades serveas auto-generated prompts, guiding the decoder to produceprecise segmentation masks. This eliminates the need formanual prompts while allowing clinicians to manually editthe auto-generated prompts to fine-tune the segmentation,enhancing both flexibility and precision. The proposed AEPLachieves state-of-the-art performance on the BraTS 2018dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness and clinical potential.The source code can be accessed online.</description>

      <title>Survival of the Fittest: Evolutionary Adaptation of Policies for Environmental Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied to solve the problem of finding obstacle-free paths for autonomous agents operating in stochastic and uncertain environments. However, when the underlying stochastic dynamics of the environment experiences drastic distribution shifts, the optimal policy obtained in the trained environment may be sub-optimal or may entirely fail in helping find goal-reaching paths for the agent. Approaches like domain randomization and robust RL can provide robust policies, but typically assume minor (bounded) distribution shifts. For substantial distribution shifts, retraining (either with a warm-start policy or from scratch) is an alternative approach. In this paper, we develop a novel approach called {\em Evolutionary Robust Policy Optimization} (ERPO), an adaptive re-training algorithm inspired by evolutionary game theory (EGT). ERPO learns an optimal policy for the shifted environment iteratively using a temperature parameter that controls the trade off between exploration and adherence to the old optimal policy. The policy update itself is an instantiation of the replicator dynamics used in EGT. We show that under fairly common sparsity assumptions on rewards in such environments, ERPO converges to the optimal policy in the shifted environment. We empirically demonstrate that for path finding tasks in a number of environments, ERPO outperforms several popular RL and deep RL algorithms (PPO, A3C, DQN) in many scenarios and popular environments. This includes scenarios where the RL algorithms are allowed to train from scratch in the new environment, when they are retrained on the new environment, or when they are used in conjunction with domain randomization. ERPO shows faster policy adaptation, higher average rewards, and reduced computational costs in policy adaptation.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes a highly developed personalised recommendation system using multimodal, autonomous, multi-agent systems. The system focuses on the incorporation of futuristic AI tech and LLMs like Gemini-1.5- pro and LLaMA-70B to improve customer service experiences especially within e-commerce. Our approach uses multi agent, multimodal systems to provide best possible recommendations to its users. The system is made up of three agents as a whole. The first agent recommends products appropriate for answering the given question, while the second asks follow-up questions based on images that belong to these recommended products and is followed up with an autonomous search by the third agent. It also features a real-time data fetch, user preferences-based recommendations and is adaptive learning. During complicated queries the application processes with Symphony, and uses the Groq API to answer quickly with low response times. It uses a multimodal way to utilize text and images comprehensively, so as to optimize product recommendation and customer interaction.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Transformer and Reinforcement Learning-based Beam Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beam management is an important technique to improve signal strength and reduce interference in wireless communication systems. Recently, there has been increasing interest in using diverse sensing modalities for beam management. However, it remains a big challenge to process multi-modal data efficiently and extract useful information. On the other hand, the recently emerging multi-modal transformer (MMT) is a promising technique that can process multi-modal data by capturing long-range dependencies. While MMT is highly effective in handling multi-modal data and providing robust beam management, integrating reinforcement learning (RL) further enhances their adaptability in dynamic environments. In this work, we propose a two-step beam management method by combining MMT with RL for dynamic beam index prediction. In the first step, we divide available beam indices into several groups and leverage MMT to process diverse data modalities to predict the optimal beam group. In the second step, we employ RL for fast beam decision-making within each group, which in return maximizes throughput. Our proposed framework is tested on a 6G dataset. In this testing scenario, it achieves higher beam prediction accuracy and system throughput compared to both the MMT-only based method and the RL-only based method.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Weapon Detection Using YOLOv8 for Enhanced Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research paper presents the development of an AI model utilizing YOLOv8 for real-time weapon detection, aimed at enhancing safety in public spaces such as schools, airports, and public transportation systems. As incidents of violence continue to rise globally, there is an urgent need for effective surveillance technologies that can quickly identify potential threats. Our approach focuses on leveraging advanced deep learning techniques to create a highly accurate and efficient system capable of detecting weapons in real-time video streams. The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset containing thousands of images depicting various types of firearms and edged weapons, ensuring a robust learning process. We evaluated the model's performance using key metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and mean Average Precision (mAP) across multiple Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, revealing a significant capability to differentiate between weapon and non-weapon classes with minimal error. Furthermore, we assessed the system's operational efficiency, demonstrating that it can process frames at high speeds suitable for real-time applications. The findings indicate that our YOLOv8-based weapon detection model not only contributes to the existing body of knowledge in computer vision but also addresses critical societal needs for improved safety measures in vulnerable environments. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, this research lays the groundwork for developing practical solutions that can be deployed in security settings, ultimately enhancing the protective capabilities of law enforcement and public safety agencies.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Deep Learning Approaches for Predictions in Unmonitored Basins with Continental-scale Stream Temperature Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prediction of streamflows and other environmental variables in unmonitored basins is a grand challenge in hydrology. Recent machine learning (ML) models can harness vast datasets for accurate predictions at large spatial scales. However, there are open questions regarding model design and data needed for inputs and training to improve performance. This study explores these questions while demonstrating the ability of deep learning models to make accurate stream temperature predictions in unmonitored basins across the conterminous United States. First, we compare top-down models that utilize data from a large number of basins with bottom-up methods that transfer ML models built on local sites, reflecting traditional regionalization techniques. We also evaluate an intermediary grouped modeling approach that categorizes sites based on regional co-location or similarity of catchment characteristics. Second, we evaluate trade-offs between model complexity, prediction accuracy, and applicability for more target locations by systematically removing inputs. We then examine model performance when additional training data becomes available due to reductions in input requirements. Our results suggest that top-down models significantly outperform bottom-up and grouped models. Moreover, it is possible to get acceptable accuracy by reducing both dynamic and static inputs enabling predictions for more sites with lower model complexity and computational needs. From detailed error analysis, we determined that the models are more accurate for sites primarily controlled by air temperatures compared to locations impacted by groundwater and dams. By addressing these questions, this research offers a comprehensive perspective on optimizing ML model design for accurate predictions in unmonitored regions.</description>

      <title>Paved or unpaved? A Deep Learning derived Road Surface Global Dataset from Mapillary Street-View Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have released an open dataset with global coverage on road surface characteristics (paved or unpaved) derived utilising 105 million images from the world's largest crowdsourcing-based street view platform, Mapillary, leveraging state-of-the-art geospatial AI methods. We propose a hybrid deep learning approach which combines SWIN-Transformer based road surface prediction and CLIP-and-DL segmentation based thresholding for filtering of bad quality images. The road surface prediction results have been matched and integrated with OpenStreetMap (OSM) road geometries. This study provides global data insights derived from maps and statistics about spatial distribution of Mapillary coverage and road pavedness on a continent and countries scale, with rural and urban distinction.This dataset expands the availability of global road surface information by over 3 million kilometers, now representing approximately 36% of the total length of the global road network.Most regions showed moderate to high paved road coverage (60-80%), but significant gaps were noted in specific areas of Africa and Asia. Urban areas tend to have near-complete paved coverage, while rural regions display more variability. Model validation against OSM surface data achieved strong performance, with F1 scores for paved roads between 91-97% across continents.Taking forward the work of Mapillary and their contributors and enrichment of OSM road attributes, our work provides valuable insights for applications in urban planning, disaster routing, logistics optimisation and addresses various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGS): especially SDGs 1 (No poverty), 3 (Good health and well-being), 8 (Decent work and economic growth), 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), 12 (Responsible consumption and production), and 13 (Climate action).</description>

      <title>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning in Large Models: A Survey of Methodologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large models, as predicted by scaling raw forecasts, have made groundbreaking progress in many fields, particularly in natural language generation tasks, where they have approached or even surpassed human levels. However, the unprecedented scale of their parameters brings significant computational and storage costs. These large models require substantial computational resources and GPU memory to operate. When adapting large models to specific downstream tasks, their massive parameter scale poses a significant challenge in fine-tuning on hardware platforms with limited computational power and GPU memory. To address this issue, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) offers a practical solution by efficiently adjusting the parameters of large pre-trained models to suit various downstream tasks. Specifically, PEFT adjusts the parameters of pre-trained large models to adapt to specific tasks or domains, minimizing the introduction of additional parameters and the computational resources required. This review mainly introduces the preliminary knowledge of PEFT, the core ideas and principles of various PEFT algorithms, the applications of PEFT, and potential future research directions. By reading this review, we believe that interested parties can quickly grasp the PEFT methodology, thereby accelerating its development and innovation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacteraemia, a bloodstream infection with high morbidity and mortality rates, poses significant diagnostic challenges. Accurate diagnosis through blood cultures is resource-intensive. Developing a machine learning model to predict blood culture outcomes in emergency departments offers potential for improved diagnosis, reduced healthcare costs, and mitigated antibiotic use.This thesis aims to identify optimal machine learning techniques for predicting bacteraemia and develop a predictive model using data from St. Antonius Hospital's emergency department. Based on current literature, CatBoost and Random Forest were selected as the most promising techniques. Model optimization using Optuna prioritized sensitivity.The final Random Forest model achieved an ROC AUC of 0.78 and demonstrated 0.92 sensitivity on the test set. Notably, it accurately identified 36.02% of patients at low risk of bacteraemia, with only 0.85% false negatives.Implementation of this model in St. Antonius Hospital's emergency department could reduce blood cultures, healthcare costs, and antibiotic treatments. Future studies should focus on external validation, exploring advanced techniques, and addressing potential confounders to ensure model generalizability.</description>

      <title>A Review of Deep Learning Approaches for Non-Invasive Cognitive Impairment Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review paper explores recent advances in deep learning approaches for non-invasive cognitive impairment detection. We examine various non-invasive indicators of cognitive decline, including speech and language, facial, and motoric mobility. The paper provides an overview of relevant datasets, feature-extracting techniques, and deep-learning architectures applied to this domain. We have analyzed the performance of different methods across modalities and observed that speech and language-based methods generally achieved the highest detection performance. Studies combining acoustic and linguistic features tended to outperform those using a single modality. Facial analysis methods showed promise for visual modalities but were less extensively studied. Most papers focused on binary classification (impaired vs. non-impaired), with fewer addressing multi-class or regression tasks. Transfer learning and pre-trained language models emerged as popular and effective techniques, especially for linguistic analysis. Despite significant progress, several challenges remain, including data standardization and accessibility, model explainability, longitudinal analysis limitations, and clinical adaptation. Lastly, we propose future research directions, such as investigating language-agnostic speech analysis methods, developing multi-modal diagnostic systems, and addressing ethical considerations in AI-assisted healthcare. By synthesizing current trends and identifying key obstacles, this review aims to guide further development of deep learning-based cognitive impairment detection systems to improve early diagnosis and ultimately patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Simmering: Sufficient is better than optimal for training neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The broad range of neural network training techniques that invoke optimization but rely on ad hoc modification for validity suggests that optimization-based training is misguided. Shortcomings of optimization-based training are brought to particularly strong relief by the problem of overfitting, where naive optimization produces spurious outcomes. The broad success of neural networks for modelling physical processes has prompted advances that are based on inverting the direction of investigation and treating neural networks as if they were physical systems in their own right These successes raise the question of whether broader, physical perspectives could motivate the construction of improved training algorithms. Here, we introduce simmering, a physics-based method that trains neural networks to generate weights and biases that are merely ``good enough'', but which, paradoxically, outperforms leading optimization-based approaches. Using classification and regression examples we show that simmering corrects neural networks that are overfit by Adam, and show that simmering avoids overfitting if deployed from the outset. Our results question optimization as a paradigm for neural network training, and leverage information-geometric arguments to point to the existence of classes of sufficient training algorithms that do not take optimization as their starting point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urbanization and technological advancements are reshaping the future of urban mobility, presenting both challenges and opportunities. This paper combines foresight and scenario planning with mathematical modeling using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to explore how Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven technologies can transform transportation systems. By simulating ODE-based models in Python, we quantify the impact of AI innovations, such as autonomous vehicles and intelligent traffic management, on reducing traffic congestion under different regulatory conditions.
  Our ODE models capture the dynamic relationship between AI adoption rates and traffic congestion, providing quantitative insights into how future scenarios might unfold. By incorporating industry collaborations and case studies, we offer strategic guidance for businesses and policymakers navigating this evolving landscape. This study contributes to understanding how foresight, scenario planning, and ODE modeling can inform strategies for creating more efficient, sustainable, and livable cities through AI adoption.</description>

      <title>Provably Adaptive Average Reward Reinforcement Learning for Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study infinite-horizon average-reward reinforcement learning (RL) for Lipschitz MDPs and develop an algorithm ZoRL that discretizes the state-action space adaptively and zooms into promising regions of the state-action space. We show that its regret can be bounded as $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}\big(T^{1 - d_{\text{eff.}}^{-1}}\big)$, where $d_{\text{eff.}} = 2d_\mathcal{S} + d_z + 3$, $d_\mathcal{S}$ is the dimension of the state space, and $d_z$ is the zooming dimension. $d_z$ is a problem-dependent quantity, which allows us to conclude that if MDP is benign, then its regret will be small. We note that the existing notion of zooming dimension for average reward RL is defined in terms of policy coverings, and hence it can be huge when the policy class is rich even though the underlying MDP is simple, so that the regret upper bound is nearly $O(T)$. The zooming dimension proposed in the current work is bounded above by $d$, the dimension of the state-action space, and hence is truly adaptive, i.e., shows how to capture adaptivity gains for infinite-horizon average-reward RL. ZoRL outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in experiments; thereby demonstrating the gains arising due to adaptivity.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Genotype and Environment Specific Latent Features for Improved Trait Prediction using a Compositional Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a compositional autoencoder (CAE) framework designed to disentangle the complex interplay between genotypic and environmental factors in high-dimensional phenotype data to improve trait prediction in plant breeding and genetics programs. Traditional predictive methods, which use compact representations of high-dimensional data through handcrafted features or latent features like PCA or more recently autoencoders, do not separate genotype-specific and environment-specific factors. We hypothesize that disentangling these features into genotype-specific and environment-specific components can enhance predictive models. To test this, we developed a compositional autoencoder (CAE) that decomposes high-dimensional data into distinct genotype-specific and environment-specific latent features.
  Our CAE framework employs a hierarchical architecture within an autoencoder to effectively separate these entangled latent features. Applied to a maize diversity panel dataset, the CAE demonstrates superior modeling of environmental influences and 5-10 times improved predictive performance for key traits like Days to Pollen and Yield, compared to the traditional methods, including standard autoencoders, PCA with regression, and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). By disentangling latent features, the CAE provides powerful tool for precision breeding and genetic research. This work significantly enhances trait prediction models, advancing agricultural and biological sciences.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Safety in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback via Rectified Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Balancing helpfulness and safety (harmlessness) is a critical challenge in aligning large language models (LLMs). Current approaches often decouple these two objectives, training separate preference models for helpfulness and safety, while framing safety as a constraint within a constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) framework. However, these methods can lead to ``safety interference'', where average-based safety constraints compromise the safety of some prompts in favor of others. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{Rectified Policy Optimization (RePO)}, which replaces the average safety constraint with stricter (per prompt) safety constraints. At the core of RePO is a policy update mechanism driven by rectified policy gradients, which penalizes the strict safety violation of every prompt, thereby enhancing safety across nearly all prompts. Our experiments on Alpaca-7B demonstrate that RePO improves the safety alignment and reduces the safety interference compared to baseline methods. Code is available at https://github.com/pxyWaterMoon/RePO.</description>

      <title>RobustKV: Defending Large Language Models against Jailbreak Attacks via KV Eviction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jailbreak attacks circumvent LLMs' built-in safeguards by concealing harmful queries within jailbreak prompts. While existing defenses primarily focus on mitigating the effects of jailbreak prompts, they often prove inadequate as jailbreak prompts can take arbitrary, adaptive forms. This paper presents RobustKV, a novel defense that adopts a fundamentally different approach by selectively removing critical tokens of harmful queries from key-value (KV) caches. Intuitively, for a jailbreak prompt to be effective, its tokens must achieve sufficient `importance' (as measured by attention scores), which inevitably lowers the importance of tokens in the concealed harmful query. Thus, by strategically evicting the KVs of the lowest-ranked tokens, RobustKV diminishes the presence of the harmful query in the KV cache, thus preventing the LLM from generating malicious responses. Extensive evaluation using benchmark datasets and models demonstrates that RobustKV effectively counters state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks while maintaining the LLM's general performance on benign queries. Moreover, RobustKV creates an intriguing evasiveness dilemma for adversaries, forcing them to balance between evading RobustKV and bypassing the LLM's built-in safeguards. This trade-off contributes to RobustKV's robustness against adaptive attacks. (warning: this paper contains potentially harmful content generated by LLMs.)</description>

      <title>Cobblestone: Iterative Automation for Formal Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formal verification using proof assistants, such as Coq, is an effective way of improving software quality, but it is expensive. Writing proofs manually requires both significant effort and expertise. Recent research has used machine learning to automatically synthesize proofs, reducing verification effort, but these tools are able to prove only a fraction of the desired software properties. We introduce Cobblestone, a new proof-synthesis approach that improves on the state of the art by taking advantage of partial progress in proof synthesis attempts. Unlike prior tools, Cobblestone can produce multiple unsuccessful proofs using a large language model (LLM), identify the working portions of those proofs, and combine them into a single, successful proof, taking advantage of internal partial progress. We evaluate Cobblestone on two benchmarks of open-source Coq projects, controlling for training data leakage in LLM datasets. Fully automatically, Cobblestone can prove 48% of the theorems, while Proverbot9001, the previous state-of-the-art, learning-based, proof-synthesis tool, can prove 17%. Cobblestone establishes a new state of the art for fully automated proof synthesis tools for Coq. We also evaluate Cobblestone in a setting where it is given external partial proof progress from oracles, serving as proxies for a human proof engineer or another tool. When the theorem is broken down into a set of subgoals and Cobblestone is given a set of relevant lemmas already proven in the project, it can prove up to 58% of the theorems. We qualitatively study the theorems Cobblestone is and is not able to prove to outline potential future research directions to further improve proof synthesis, including developing interactive, semi-automated tools. Our research shows that tools can make better use of partial progress made during proof synthesis to more effectively automate formal verification.</description>

      <title>Assessing the societal influence of academic research with ChatGPT: Impact case study evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Academics and departments are sometimes judged by how their research has benefitted society. For example, the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) assesses Impact Case Studies (ICS), which are five-page evidence-based claims of societal impacts. This study investigates whether ChatGPT can evaluate societal impact claims and therefore potentially support expert human assessors. For this, various parts of 6,220 public ICS from REF2021 were fed to ChatGPT 4o-mini along with the REF2021 evaluation guidelines, comparing the results with published departmental average ICS scores. The results suggest that the optimal strategy for high correlations with expert scores is to input the title and summary of an ICS but not the remaining text, and to modify the original REF guidelines to encourage a stricter evaluation. The scores generated by this approach correlated positively with departmental average scores in all 34 Units of Assessment (UoAs), with values between 0.18 (Economics and Econometrics) and 0.56 (Psychology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience). At the departmental level, the corresponding correlations were higher, reaching 0.71 for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Leisure and Tourism. Thus, ChatGPT-based ICS evaluations are simple and viable to support or cross-check expert judgments, although their value varies substantially between fields.</description>

      <title>DualMAR: Medical-Augmented Representation from Dual-Expertise Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) has revolutionized healthcare data management and prediction in the field of AI and machine learning. Accurate predictions of diagnosis and medications significantly mitigate health risks and provide guidance for preventive care. However, EHR driven models often have limited scope on understanding medical-domain knowledge and mostly rely on simple-and-sole ontologies. In addition, due to the missing features and incomplete disease coverage of EHR, most studies only focus on basic analysis on conditions and medication. We propose DualMAR, a framework that enhances EHR prediction tasks through both individual observation data and public knowledge bases. First, we construct a bi-hierarchical Diagnosis Knowledge Graph (KG) using verified public clinical ontologies and augment this KG via Large Language Models (LLMs); Second, we design a new proxy-task learning on lab results in EHR for pretraining, which further enhance KG representation and patient embeddings. By retrieving radial and angular coordinates upon polar space, DualMAR enables accurate predictions based on rich hierarchical and semantic embeddings from KG. Experiments also demonstrate that DualMAR outperforms state-of-the-art models, validating its effectiveness in EHR prediction and KG integration in medical domains.</description>

      <title>Understanding Adam Requires Better Rotation Dependent Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite its widespread adoption, Adam's advantage over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) lacks a comprehensive theoretical explanation. This paper investigates Adam's sensitivity to rotations of the parameter space. We demonstrate that Adam's performance in training transformers degrades under random rotations of the parameter space, indicating a crucial sensitivity to the choice of basis. This reveals that conventional rotation-invariant assumptions are insufficient to capture Adam's advantages theoretically. To better understand the rotation-dependent properties that benefit Adam, we also identify structured rotations that preserve or even enhance its empirical performance. We then examine the rotation-dependent assumptions in the literature, evaluating their adequacy in explaining Adam's behavior across various rotation types. This work highlights the need for new, rotation-dependent theoretical frameworks to fully understand Adam's empirical success in modern machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>OReole-FM: successes and challenges toward billion-parameter foundation models for high-resolution satellite imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the pretraining of Foundation Models (FMs) for remote sensing (RS) imagery is on the rise, models remain restricted to a few hundred million parameters. Scaling models to billions of parameters has been shown to yield unprecedented benefits including emergent abilities, but requires data scaling and computing resources typically not available outside industry R&amp;D labs. In this work, we pair high-performance computing resources including Frontier supercomputer, America's first exascale system, and high-resolution optical RS data to pretrain billion-scale FMs. Our study assesses performance of different pretrained variants of vision Transformers across image classification, semantic segmentation and object detection benchmarks, which highlight the importance of data scaling for effective model scaling. Moreover, we discuss construction of a novel TIU pretraining dataset, model initialization, with data and pretrained models intended for public release. By discussing technical challenges and details often lacking in the related literature, this work is intended to offer best practices to the geospatial community toward efficient training and benchmarking of larger FMs.</description>

      <title>SAD: State-Action Distillation for In-Context Reinforcement Learning under Random Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pretrained foundation models have exhibited extraordinary in-context learning performance, allowing zero-shot generalization to new tasks not encountered during the pretraining. In the case of RL, in-context RL (ICRL) emerges when pretraining FMs on decision-making problems in an autoregressive-supervised manner. Nevertheless, current state-of-the-art ICRL algorithms, such as AD, DPT and DIT, impose stringent requirements on generating the pretraining dataset concerning the behavior (source) policies, context information, and action labels, etc. Notably, these algorithms either demand optimal policies or require varying degrees of well-trained behavior policies for all environments during the generation of the pretraining dataset. This significantly hinders the application of ICRL to real-world scenarios, where acquiring optimal or well-trained policies for a substantial volume of real-world training environments can be both prohibitively intractable and expensive. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel approach, termed State-Action Distillation (SAD), that allows to generate a remarkable pretraining dataset guided solely by random policies. In particular, SAD selects query states and corresponding action labels by distilling the outstanding state-action pairs from the entire state and action spaces by using random policies within a trust horizon, and then inherits the classical autoregressive-supervised mechanism during the pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables promising ICRL under (e.g., uniform) random policies and random contexts. We establish theoretical analyses regarding the performance guarantees of SAD. Moreover, our empirical results across multiple ICRL benchmark environments demonstrate that, on average, SAD outperforms the best baseline by 180.86% in the offline evaluation and by 172.8% in the online evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) has given rise to a new paradigm known as the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). In this survey, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of AIoT research. We examine AIoT literature related to sensing, computing, and networking &amp; communication, which form the three key components of AIoT. In addition to advancements in these areas, we review domain-specific AIoT systems that are designed for various important application domains. We have also created an accompanying GitHub repository, where we compile the papers included in this survey: https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/AIoT-Survey. This repository will be actively maintained and updated with new research as it becomes available. As both IoT and AI become increasingly critical to our society, we believe AIoT is emerging as an essential research field at the intersection of IoT and modern AI. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource for those engaged in AIoT research and act as a catalyst for future explorations to bridge gaps and drive advancements in this exciting field.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Battery Storage Energy Arbitrage with Deep Reinforcement Learning and Time-Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy arbitrage is one of the most profitable sources of income for battery operators, generating revenues by buying and selling electricity at different prices. Forecasting these revenues is challenging due to the inherent uncertainty of electricity prices. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) emerged in recent years as a promising tool, able to cope with uncertainty by training on large quantities of historical data. However, without access to future electricity prices, DRL agents can only react to the currently observed price and not learn to plan battery dispatch. Therefore, in this study, we combine DRL with time-series forecasting methods from deep learning to enhance the performance on energy arbitrage. We conduct a case study using price data from Alberta, Canada that is characterized by irregular price spikes and highly non-stationary. This data is challenging to forecast even when state-of-the-art deep learning models consisting of convolutional layers, recurrent layers, and attention modules are deployed. Our results show that energy arbitrage with DRL-enabled battery control still significantly benefits from these imperfect predictions, but only if predictors for several horizons are combined. Grouping multiple predictions for the next 24-hour window, accumulated rewards increased by 60% for deep Q-networks (DQN) compared to the experiments without forecasts. We hypothesize that multiple predictors, despite their imperfections, convey useful information regarding the future development of electricity prices through a "majority vote" principle, enabling the DRL agent to learn more profitable control policies.</description>

      <title>Off-Policy Selection for Initiating Human-Centric Experimental Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In human-centric tasks such as healthcare and education, the heterogeneity among patients and students necessitates personalized treatments and instructional interventions. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been utilized in those tasks, off-policy selection (OPS) is pivotal to close the loop by offline evaluating and selecting policies without online interactions, yet current OPS methods often overlook the heterogeneity among participants. Our work is centered on resolving a pivotal challenge in human-centric systems (HCSs): how to select a policy to deploy when a new participant joining the cohort, without having access to any prior offline data collected over the participant? We introduce First-Glance Off-Policy Selection (FPS), a novel approach that systematically addresses participant heterogeneity through sub-group segmentation and tailored OPS criteria to each sub-group. By grouping individuals with similar traits, FPS facilitates personalized policy selection aligned with unique characteristics of each participant or group of participants. FPS is evaluated via two important but challenging applications, intelligent tutoring systems and a healthcare application for sepsis treatment and intervention. FPS presents significant advancement in enhancing learning outcomes of students and in-hospital care outcomes.</description>

      <title>GHIL-Glue: Hierarchical Control with Filtered Subgoal Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image and video generative models that are pre-trained on Internet-scale data can greatly increase the generalization capacity of robot learning systems. These models can function as high-level planners, generating intermediate subgoals for low-level goal-conditioned policies to reach. However, the performance of these systems can be greatly bottlenecked by the interface between generative models and low-level controllers. For example, generative models may predict photorealistic yet physically infeasible frames that confuse low-level policies. Low-level policies may also be sensitive to subtle visual artifacts in generated goal images. This paper addresses these two facets of generalization, providing an interface to effectively "glue together" language-conditioned image or video prediction models with low-level goal-conditioned policies. Our method, Generative Hierarchical Imitation Learning-Glue (GHIL-Glue), filters out subgoals that do not lead to task progress and improves the robustness of goal-conditioned policies to generated subgoals with harmful visual artifacts. We find in extensive experiments in both simulated and real environments that GHIL-Glue achieves a 25% improvement across several hierarchical models that leverage generative subgoals, achieving a new state-of-the-art on the CALVIN simulation benchmark for policies using observations from a single RGB camera. GHIL-Glue also outperforms other generalist robot policies across 3/4 language-conditioned manipulation tasks testing zero-shot generalization in physical experiments.</description>

      <title>Think Carefully and Check Again! Meta-Generation Unlocking LLMs for Low-Resource Cross-Lingual Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-lingual summarization (CLS) aims to generate a summary for the source text in a different target language. Currently, instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) excel at various English tasks. However, unlike languages such as English, Chinese or Spanish, for those relatively low-resource languages with limited usage or data, recent studies have shown that LLMs' performance on CLS tasks remains unsatisfactory even with few-shot settings. This raises the question: Are LLMs capable of handling cross-lingual summarization tasks for low-resource languages? To resolve this question, we fully explore the potential of large language models on cross-lingual summarization task for low-resource languages through our four-step zero-shot method: Summarization, Improvement, Translation and Refinement (SITR) with correspondingly designed prompts. We test our proposed method with multiple LLMs on two well-known cross-lingual summarization datasets with various low-resource target languages. The results show that: i) GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 significantly and consistently outperform other baselines when using our zero-shot SITR methods. ii) By employing our proposed method, we unlock the potential of LLMs, enabling them to effectively handle cross-lingual summarization tasks for relatively low-resource languages.</description>

      <title>Beyond Fine-Tuning: Effective Strategies for Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Language Models for Data Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly important in natural language processing, enabling advanced data analytics through natural language queries. However, these models often generate "hallucinations"-inaccurate or fabricated information-that can undermine their reliability in critical data-driven decision-making. Addressing the challenge of hallucinations is essential to improve the accuracy and trustworthiness of LLMs in processing natural language queries. This research focuses on mitigating hallucinations in LLMs, specifically within the context of data analytics. We introduce and evaluate four targeted strategies: Structured Output Generation, Strict Rules Enforcement, System Prompt Enhancements, and Semantic Layer Integration. Our findings show that these methods are more effective than traditional fine-tuning approaches in reducing hallucinations, offering a more reliable framework for deploying LLMs in natural language queries for data analytics. This research demonstrates the potential of these strategies to enhance the accuracy of LLM-driven data queries, ensuring more dependable results in data-driven environments.</description>

      <title>FLOW: A Feedback LOop FrameWork for Simultaneously Enhancing Recommendation and User Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agents powered by large language models have shown remarkable reasoning and execution capabilities, attracting researchers to explore their potential in the recommendation domain. Previous studies have primarily focused on enhancing the capabilities of either recommendation agents or user agents independently, but have not considered the interaction and collaboration between recommendation agents and user agents. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework named FLOW, which achieves collaboration between the recommendation agent and the user agent by introducing a feedback loop. Specifically, the recommendation agent refines its understanding of the user's preferences by analyzing the user agent's feedback on previously suggested items, while the user agent leverages suggested items to uncover deeper insights into the user's latent interests. This iterative refinement process enhances the reasoning capabilities of both the recommendation agent and the user agent, enabling more precise recommendations and a more accurate simulation of user behavior. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the feedback loop, we evaluate both recommendation performance and user simulation performance on three widely used recommendation domain datasets. The experimental results indicate that the feedback loop can simultaneously improve the performance of both the recommendation and user agents.</description>

Abstract: We present SCube, a novel method for reconstructing large-scale 3D scenes (geometry, appearance, and semantics) from a sparse set of posed images. Our method encodes reconstructed scenes using a novel representation VoxSplat, which is a set of 3D Gaussians supported on a high-resolution sparse-voxel scaffold. To reconstruct a VoxSplat from images, we employ a hierarchical voxel latent diffusion model conditioned on the input images followed by a feedforward appearance prediction model. The diffusion model generates high-resolution grids progressively in a coarse-to-fine manner, and the appearance network predicts a set of Gaussians within each voxel. From as few as 3 non-overlapping input images, SCube can generate millions of Gaussians with a 1024^3 voxel grid spanning hundreds of meters in 20 seconds. Past works tackling scene reconstruction from images either rely on per-scene optimization and fail to reconstruct the scene away from input views (thus requiring dense view coverage as input) or leverage geometric priors based on low-resolution models, which produce blurry results. In contrast, SCube leverages high-resolution sparse networks and produces sharp outputs from few views. We show the superiority of SCube compared to prior art using the Waymo self-driving dataset on 3D reconstruction and demonstrate its applications, such as LiDAR simulation and text-to-scene generation.</description>

      <title>Sensor2Text: Enabling Natural Language Interactions for Daily Activity Tracking Using Wearable Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Question-Answering, a technology that generates textual responses from an image and natural language question, has progressed significantly. Notably, it can aid in tracking and inquiring about daily activities, crucial in healthcare monitoring, especially for elderly patients or those with memory disabilities. However, video poses privacy concerns and has a limited field of view. This paper presents Sensor2Text, a model proficient in tracking daily activities and engaging in conversations using wearable sensors. The approach outlined here tackles several challenges, including low information density in wearable sensor data, insufficiency of single wearable sensors in human activities recognition, and model's limited capacity for Question-Answering and interactive conversations. To resolve these obstacles, transfer learning and student-teacher networks are utilized to leverage knowledge from visual-language models. Additionally, an encoder-decoder neural network model is devised to jointly process language and sensor data for conversational purposes. Furthermore, Large Language Models are also utilized to enable interactive capabilities. The model showcases the ability to identify human activities and engage in Q\&amp;A dialogues using various wearable sensor modalities. It performs comparably to or better than existing visual-language models in both captioning and conversational tasks. To our knowledge, this represents the first model capable of conversing about wearable sensor data, offering an innovative approach to daily activity tracking that addresses privacy and field-of-view limitations associated with current vision-based solutions.</description>

      <title>Training the Untrainable: Introducing Inductive Bias via Representational Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that architectures which traditionally are considered to be ill-suited for a task can be trained using inductive biases from another architecture. Networks are considered untrainable when they overfit, underfit, or converge to poor results even when tuning their hyperparameters. For example, plain fully connected networks overfit on object recognition while deep convolutional networks without residual connections underfit. The traditional answer is to change the architecture to impose some inductive bias, although what that bias is remains unknown. We introduce guidance, where a guide network guides a target network using a neural distance function. The target is optimized to perform well and to match its internal representations, layer-by-layer, to those of the guide; the guide is unchanged. If the guide is trained, this transfers over part of the architectural prior and knowledge of the guide to the target. If the guide is untrained, this transfers over only part of the architectural prior of the guide. In this manner, we can investigate what kinds of priors different architectures place on untrainable networks such as fully connected networks. We demonstrate that this method overcomes the immediate overfitting of fully connected networks on vision tasks, makes plain CNNs competitive to ResNets, closes much of the gap between plain vanilla RNNs and Transformers, and can even help Transformers learn tasks which RNNs can perform more easily. We also discover evidence that better initializations of fully connected networks likely exist to avoid overfitting. Our method provides a mathematical tool to investigate priors and architectures, and in the long term, may demystify the dark art of architecture creation, even perhaps turning architectures into a continuous optimizable parameter of the network.</description>

      <title>Roles of LLMs in the Overall Mental Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To better understand existing LLMs, we may examine the human mental (cognitive/psychological) architecture, and its components and structures. Based on psychological, philosophical, and cognitive science literatures, it is argued that, within the human mental architecture, existing LLMs correspond well with implicit mental processes (intuition, instinct, and so on). However, beyond such implicit processes, explicit processes (with better symbolic capabilities) are also present within the human mental architecture, judging from psychological, philosophical, and cognitive science literatures. Various theoretical and empirical issues and questions in this regard are explored. Furthermore, it is argued that existing dual-process computational cognitive architectures (models of the human cognitive/psychological architecture) provide usable frameworks for fundamentally enhancing LLMs by introducing dual processes (both implicit and explicit) and, in the meantime, can also be enhanced by LLMs. The results are synergistic combinations (in several different senses simultaneously).</description>

      <title>DQRM: Deep Quantized Recommendation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale recommendation models are currently the dominant workload for many large Internet companies. These recommenders are characterized by massive embedding tables that are sparsely accessed by the index for user and item features. The size of these 1TB+ tables imposes a severe memory bottleneck for the training and inference of recommendation models. In this work, we propose a novel recommendation framework that is small, powerful, and efficient to run and train, based on the state-of-the-art Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM). The proposed framework makes inference more efficient on the cloud servers, explores the possibility of deploying powerful recommenders on smaller edge devices, and optimizes the workload of the communication overhead in distributed training under the data parallelism settings. Specifically, we show that quantization-aware training (QAT) can impose a strong regularization effect to mitigate the severe overfitting issues suffered by DLRMs. Consequently, we achieved INT4 quantization of DLRM models without any accuracy drop. We further propose two techniques that improve and accelerate the conventional QAT workload specifically for the embedding tables in the recommendation models. Furthermore, to achieve efficient training, we quantize the gradients of the embedding tables into INT8 on top of the well-supported specified sparsification. We show that combining gradient sparsification and quantization together significantly reduces the amount of communication. Briefly, DQRM models with INT4 can achieve 79.07% accuracy on Kaggle with 0.27 GB model size, and 81.21% accuracy on the Terabyte dataset with 1.57 GB, which even outperform FP32 DLRMs that have much larger model sizes (2.16 GB on Kaggle and 12.58 on Terabyte).</description>

      <title>AutoMIR: Effective Zero-Shot Medical Information Retrieval without Relevance Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical information retrieval (MIR) is essential for retrieving relevant medical knowledge from diverse sources, including electronic health records, scientific literature, and medical databases. However, achieving effective zero-shot dense retrieval in the medical domain poses substantial challenges due to the lack of relevance-labeled data. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Self-Learning Hypothetical Document Embeddings (SL-HyDE) to tackle this issue. SL-HyDE leverages large language models (LLMs) as generators to generate hypothetical documents based on a given query. These generated documents encapsulate key medical context, guiding a dense retriever in identifying the most relevant documents. The self-learning framework progressively refines both pseudo-document generation and retrieval, utilizing unlabeled medical corpora without requiring any relevance-labeled data. Additionally, we present the Chinese Medical Information Retrieval Benchmark (CMIRB), a comprehensive evaluation framework grounded in real-world medical scenarios, encompassing five tasks and ten datasets. By benchmarking ten models on CMIRB, we establish a rigorous standard for evaluating medical information retrieval systems. Experimental results demonstrate that SL-HyDE significantly surpasses existing methods in retrieval accuracy while showcasing strong generalization and scalability across various LLM and retriever configurations. CMIRB data and evaluation code are publicly available at: https://github.com/CMIRB-benchmark/CMIRB.</description>

Abstract: We consider the task of classifying trajectories of boat activities as a proxy for assessing maritime threats. Previous approaches have considered entropy-based metrics for clustering boat activity into three broad categories: random walk, following, and chasing. Here, we comprehensively assess the accuracy of neural network-based approaches as alternatives to entropy-based clustering. We train four neural network models and compare them to shallow learning using synthetic data. We also investigate the accuracy of models as time steps increase and with and without rotated data. To improve test-time robustness, we normalize trajectories and perform rotation-based data augmentation. Our results show that deep networks can achieve a test-set accuracy of up to 100% on a full trajectory, with graceful degradation as the number of time steps decreases, outperforming entropy-based clustering.</description>

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis(KO) is a degenerative joint disease that can cause severe pain and impairment. With increased prevalence, precise diagnosis by medical imaging analytics is crucial for appropriate illness management. This research investigates a comparative analysis between traditional machine learning techniques and new deep learning models for diagnosing KO severity from X-ray pictures. This study does not introduce new architectural innovations but rather illuminates the robust applicability and comparative effectiveness of pre-existing ViT models in a medical imaging context, specifically for KO severity diagnosis. The insights garnered from this comparative analysis advocate for the integration of advanced ViT models in clinical diagnostic workflows, potentially revolutionizing the precision and reliability of KO assessments. This study does not introduce new architectural innovations but rather illuminates the robust applicability and comparative effectiveness of pre-existing ViT models in a medical imaging context, specifically for KO severity diagnosis. The insights garnered from this comparative analysis advocate for the integration of advanced ViT models in clinical diagnostic workflows, potentially revolutionizing the precision &amp; reliability of KO assessments. The study utilizes an osteoarthritis dataset from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) comprising images with 5 severity categories and uneven class distribution. While classic machine learning models like GaussianNB and KNN struggle in feature extraction, Convolutional Neural Networks such as Inception-V3, VGG-19 achieve better accuracy between 55-65% by learning hierarchical visual patterns. However, Vision Transformer architectures like Da-VIT, GCViT and MaxViT emerge as indisputable champions, displaying 66.14% accuracy, 0.703 precision, 0.614 recall, AUC exceeding 0.835 thanks to self-attention processes.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Modal Non-Invasive Deep Learning Framework for Progressive Prediction of Seizures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative framework designed for progressive (granular in time to onset) prediction of seizures through the utilization of a Deep Learning (DL) methodology based on non-invasive multi-modal sensor networks. Epilepsy, a debilitating neurological condition, affects an estimated 65 million individuals globally, with a substantial proportion facing drug-resistant epilepsy despite pharmacological interventions. To address this challenge, we advocate for predictive systems that provide timely alerts to individuals at risk, enabling them to take precautionary actions. Our framework employs advanced DL techniques and uses personalized data from a network of non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy. The algorithms are optimized for real-time processing on edge devices, mitigating privacy concerns and minimizing data transmission overhead inherent in cloud-based solutions, ultimately preserving battery energy. Additionally, our system predicts the countdown time to seizures (with 15-minute intervals up to an hour prior to the onset), offering critical lead time for preventive actions. Our multi-modal model achieves 95% sensitivity, 98% specificity, and 97% accuracy, averaged among 29 patients.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Keyphrase Ranking for Relevance and Diversity Using Submodular Function Optimization (SFO)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Keyphrase ranking plays a crucial role in information retrieval and summarization by indexing and retrieving relevant information efficiently. Advances in natural language processing, especially large language models (LLMs), have improved keyphrase extraction and ranking. However, traditional methods often overlook diversity, resulting in redundant keyphrases. We propose a novel approach using Submodular Function Optimization (SFO) to balance relevance and diversity in keyphrase ranking. By framing the task as submodular maximization, our method selects diverse and representative keyphrases. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms existing methods in both relevance and diversity metrics, achieving SOTA performance in execution time. Our code is available online.</description>

      <title>RARe: Retrieval Augmented Retrieval with In-Context Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether in-context examples, widely used in decoder-only language models (LLMs), can improve embedding model performance in retrieval tasks. Unlike in LLMs, naively prepending in-context examples (query-document pairs) to the target query at inference time does not work out of the box. We introduce a simple approach to enable retrievers to use in-context examples. Our approach, RARe, finetunes a pre-trained model with in-context examples whose query is semantically similar to the target query. This can be applied to adapt various base architectures (i.e., decoder-only language models, retriever models) and consistently achieves performance gains of up to +2.72% nDCG across various open-domain retrieval datasets (BeIR, RAR-b). In particular, we find RARe exhibits stronger out-of-domain generalization compared to models using queries without in-context examples, similar to what is seen for in-context learning in LLMs. We further provide analysis on the design choices of in-context example augmentation and lay the foundation for future work in this space.</description>

      <title>OGBench: Benchmarking Offline Goal-Conditioned RL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) is a major problem in reinforcement learning (RL) because it provides a simple, unsupervised, and domain-agnostic way to acquire diverse behaviors and representations from unlabeled data without rewards. Despite the importance of this setting, we lack a standard benchmark that can systematically evaluate the capabilities of offline GCRL algorithms. In this work, we propose OGBench, a new, high-quality benchmark for algorithms research in offline goal-conditioned RL. OGBench consists of 8 types of environments, 85 datasets, and reference implementations of 6 representative offline GCRL algorithms. We have designed these challenging and realistic environments and datasets to directly probe different capabilities of algorithms, such as stitching, long-horizon reasoning, and the ability to handle high-dimensional inputs and stochasticity. While representative algorithms may rank similarly on prior benchmarks, our experiments reveal stark strengths and weaknesses in these different capabilities, providing a strong foundation for building new algorithms.

      <title>Self-Normalized Resets for Plasticity in Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasticity Loss is an increasingly important phenomenon that refers to the empirical observation that as a neural network is continually trained on a sequence of changing tasks, its ability to adapt to a new task diminishes over time. We introduce Self-Normalized Resets (SNR), a simple adaptive algorithm that mitigates plasticity loss by resetting a neuron's weights when evidence suggests its firing rate has effectively dropped to zero. Across a battery of continual learning problems and network architectures, we demonstrate that SNR consistently attains superior performance compared to its competitor algorithms. We also demonstrate that SNR is robust to its sole hyperparameter, its rejection percentile threshold, while competitor algorithms show significant sensitivity. SNR's threshold-based reset mechanism is motivated by a simple hypothesis test that we derive. Seen through the lens of this hypothesis test, competing reset proposals yield suboptimal error rates in correctly detecting inactive neurons, potentially explaining our experimental observations. We also conduct a theoretical investigation of the optimization landscape for the problem of learning a single ReLU. We show that even when initialized adversarially, an idealized version of SNR learns the target ReLU, while regularization-based approaches can fail to learn.</description>

Abstract: Understanding how neural networks transform input data across layers is fundamental to unraveling their learning and generalization capabilities. Although prior work has used insights from kernel methods to study neural networks, a global analysis of how the similarity between hidden representations evolves across layers remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework for the evolution of the kernel sequence, which measures the similarity between the hidden representation for two different inputs. Operating under the mean-field regime, we show that the kernel sequence evolves deterministically via a kernel map, which only depends on the activation function. By expanding activation using Hermite polynomials and using their algebraic properties, we derive an explicit form for kernel map and fully characterize its fixed points. Our analysis reveals that for nonlinear activations, the kernel sequence converges globally to a unique fixed point, which can correspond to orthogonal or similar representations depending on the activation and network architecture. We further extend our results to networks with residual connections and normalization layers, demonstrating similar convergence behaviors. This work provides new insights into the implicit biases of deep neural networks and how architectural choices influence the evolution of representations across layers.</description>

      <title>GiVE: Guiding Visual Encoder to Perceive Overlooked Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models have advanced AI in applications like text-to-video generation and visual question answering. These models rely on visual encoders to convert non-text data into vectors, but current encoders either lack semantic alignment or overlook non-salient objects. We propose the Guiding Visual Encoder to Perceive Overlooked Information (GiVE) approach. GiVE enhances visual representation with an Attention-Guided Adapter (AG-Adapter) module and an Object-focused Visual Semantic Learning module. These incorporate three novel loss terms: Object-focused Image-Text Contrast (OITC) loss, Object-focused Image-Image Contrast (OIIC) loss, and Object-focused Image Discrimination (OID) loss, improving object consideration, retrieval accuracy, and comprehensiveness. Our contributions include dynamic visual focus adjustment, novel loss functions to enhance object retrieval, and the Multi-Object Instruction (MOInst) dataset. Experiments show our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Estuary: A Framework For Building Multimodal Low-Latency Real-Time Socially Interactive Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise in capability and ubiquity of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has enabled its application to the field of Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs). Despite rising interest in modern AI-powered components used for real-time SIA research, substantial friction remains due to the absence of a standardized and universal SIA framework. To target this absence, we developed Estuary: a multimodal (text, audio, and soon video) framework which facilitates the development of low-latency, real-time SIAs. Estuary seeks to reduce repeat work between studies and to provide a flexible platform that can be run entirely off-cloud to maximize configurability, controllability, reproducibility of studies, and speed of agent response times. We are able to do this by constructing a robust multimodal framework which incorporates current and future components seamlessly into a modular and interoperable architecture.</description>

      <title>On-Site Precise Screening of SARS-CoV-2 Systems Using a Channel-Wise Attention-Based PLS-1D-CNN Model with Limited Infrared Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the early stages of respiratory virus outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the efficient utilize of limited nasopharyngeal swabs for rapid and accurate screening is crucial for public health. In this study, we present a methodology that integrates attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) with the adaptive iteratively reweighted penalized least squares (airPLS) preprocessing algorithm and a channel-wise attention-based partial least squares one-dimensional convolutional neural network (PLS-1D-CNN) model, enabling accurate screening of infected individuals within 10 minutes. Two cohorts of nasopharyngeal swab samples, comprising 126 and 112 samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant cases, were collected at Beijing You'an Hospital for verification. Given that ATR-FTIR spectra are highly sensitive to variations in experimental conditions, which can affect their quality, we propose a biomolecular importance (BMI) evaluation method to assess signal quality across different conditions, validated by comparing BMI with PLS-GBM and PLS-RF results. For the ATR-FTIR signals in cohort 2, which exhibited a higher BMI, airPLS was utilized for signal preprocessing, followed by the application of the channel-wise attention-based PLS-1D-CNN model for screening. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms recently reported methods in the field of respiratory virus spectrum detection, achieving a recognition screening accuracy of 96.48%, a sensitivity of 96.24%, a specificity of 97.14%, an F1-score of 96.12%, and an AUC of 0.99. It meets the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended criteria for an acceptable product: sensitivity of 95.00% or greater and specificity of 97.00% or greater for testing prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in moderate to high volume scenarios.</description>

      <title>Mask-based Membership Inference Attacks for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been an effective approach to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by incorporating up-to-date and domain-specific knowledge. Recently, there has been a trend of storing up-to-date or copyrighted data in RAG knowledge databases instead of using it for LLM training. This practice has raised concerns about Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which aim to detect if a specific target document is stored in the RAG system's knowledge database so as to protect the rights of data producers. While research has focused on enhancing the trustworthiness of RAG systems, existing MIAs for RAG systems remain largely insufficient. Previous work either relies solely on the RAG system's judgment or is easily influenced by other documents or the LLM's internal knowledge, which is unreliable and lacks explainability. To address these limitations, we propose a Mask-Based Membership Inference Attacks (MBA) framework. Our framework first employs a masking algorithm that effectively masks a certain number of words in the target document. The masked text is then used to prompt the RAG system, and the RAG system is required to predict the mask values. If the target document appears in the knowledge database, the masked text will retrieve the complete target document as context, allowing for accurate mask prediction. Finally, we adopt a simple yet effective threshold-based method to infer the membership of target document by analyzing the accuracy of mask prediction. Our mask-based approach is more document-specific, making the RAG system's generation less susceptible to distractions from other documents or the LLM's internal knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing baseline models.</description>

      <title>Exploring Welfare Maximization and Fairness in Participatory Budgeting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Participatory budgeting (PB) is a voting paradigm for distributing a divisible resource, usually called a budget, among a set of projects by aggregating the preferences of individuals over these projects. It is implemented quite extensively for purposes such as government allocating funds to public projects and funding agencies selecting research proposals to support. This PhD dissertation studies the welfare-related and fairness-related objectives for different PB models. Our contribution lies in proposing and exploring novel PB rules that maximize welfare and promote fairness, as well as, in introducing and investigating a range of novel utility notions, axiomatic properties, and fairness notions, effectively filling the gaps in the existing literature for each PB model. The thesis is divided into two main parts, the first focusing on dichotomous and the second focusing on ordinal preferences. Each part considers two cases: (i) the cost of each project is restricted to a single value and partial funding is not permitted and (ii) the cost of each project is flexible and may assume multiple values.</description>

      <title>AdaNeg: Adaptive Negative Proxy Guided OOD Detection with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that pre-trained vision-language models are effective at identifying out-of-distribution (OOD) samples by using negative labels as guidance. However, employing consistent negative labels across different OOD datasets often results in semantic misalignments, as these text labels may not accurately reflect the actual space of OOD images. To overcome this issue, we introduce \textit{adaptive negative proxies}, which are dynamically generated during testing by exploring actual OOD images, to align more closely with the underlying OOD label space and enhance the efficacy of negative proxy guidance. Specifically, our approach utilizes a feature memory bank to selectively cache discriminative features from test images, representing the targeted OOD distribution. This facilitates the creation of proxies that can better align with specific OOD datasets. While task-adaptive proxies average features to reflect the unique characteristics of each dataset, the sample-adaptive proxies weight features based on their similarity to individual test samples, exploring detailed sample-level nuances. The final score for identifying OOD samples integrates static negative labels with our proposed adaptive proxies, effectively combining textual and visual knowledge for enhanced performance. Our method is training-free and annotation-free, and it maintains fast testing speed. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, abbreviated as AdaNeg. Notably, on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark, our AdaNeg significantly outperforms existing methods, with a 2.45\% increase in AUROC and a 6.48\% reduction in FPR95.

      <title>Diff-CXR: Report-to-CXR generation through a disease-knowledge enhanced diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-To-Image (TTI) generation is significant for controlled and diverse image generation with broad potential applications. Although current medical TTI methods have made some progress in report-to-Chest-Xray (CXR) generation, their generation performance may be limited due to the intrinsic characteristics of medical data. In this paper, we propose a novel disease-knowledge enhanced Diffusion-based TTI learning framework, named Diff-CXR, for medical report-to-CXR generation. First, to minimize the negative impacts of noisy data on generation, we devise a Latent Noise Filtering Strategy that gradually learns the general patterns of anomalies and removes them in the latent space. Then, an Adaptive Vision-Aware Textual Learning Strategy is designed to learn concise and important report embeddings in a domain-specific Vision-Language Model, providing textual guidance for Chest-Xray generation. Finally, by incorporating the general disease knowledge into the pretrained TTI model via a delicate control adapter, a disease-knowledge enhanced diffusion model is introduced to achieve realistic and precise report-to-CXR generation. Experimentally, our Diff-CXR outperforms previous SOTA medical TTI methods by 33.4\% / 8.0\% and 23.8\% / 56.4\% in the FID and mAUC score on MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray, with the lowest computational complexity at 29.641 GFLOPs. Downstream experiments on three thorax disease classification benchmarks and one CXR-report generation benchmark demonstrate that Diff-CXR is effective in improving classical CXR analysis methods. Notably, models trained on the combination of 1\% real data and synthetic data can achieve a competitive mAUC score compared to models trained on all data, presenting promising clinical applications.</description>

      <title>A Stack-Propagation Framework for Low-Resource Personalized Dialogue Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the resurgent interest in building open-domain dialogue systems, the dialogue generation task has attracted increasing attention over the past few years. This task is usually formulated as a conditional generation problem, which aims to generate a natural and meaningful response given dialogue contexts and specific constraints, such as persona. And maintaining a consistent persona is essential for the dialogue systems to gain trust from the users. Although tremendous advancements have been brought, traditional persona-based dialogue models are typically trained by leveraging a large number of persona-dense dialogue examples. Yet, such persona-dense training data are expensive to obtain, leading to a limited scale. This work presents a novel approach to learning from limited training examples by regarding consistency understanding as a regularization of response generation. To this end, we propose a novel stack-propagation framework for learning a generation and understanding pipeline.Specifically, the framework stacks a Transformer encoder and two Transformer decoders, where the first decoder models response generation and the second serves as a regularizer and jointly models response generation and consistency understanding. The proposed framework can benefit from the stacked encoder and decoders to learn from much smaller personalized dialogue data while maintaining competitive performance. Under different low-resource settings, subjective and objective evaluations prove that the stack-propagation framework outperforms strong baselines in response quality and persona consistency and largely overcomes the shortcomings of traditional models that rely heavily on the persona-dense dialogue data.</description>

      <title>Chemical Language Model Linker: blending text and molecules with modular adapters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of large language models and multi-modal models has enabled the appealing idea of generating novel molecules from text descriptions. Generative modeling would shift the paradigm from relying on large-scale chemical screening to find molecules with desired properties to directly generating those molecules. However, multi-modal models combining text and molecules are often trained from scratch, without leveraging existing high-quality pretrained models. That approach consumes more computational resources and prohibits model scaling. In contrast, we propose a lightweight adapter-based strategy named Chemical Language Model Linker (ChemLML). ChemLML blends the two single domain models and obtains conditional molecular generation from text descriptions while still operating in the specialized embedding spaces of the molecular domain. ChemLML can tailor diverse pretrained text models for molecule generation by training relatively few adapter parameters. We find that the choice of molecular representation used within ChemLML, SMILES versus SELFIES, has a strong influence on conditional molecular generation performance. SMILES is often preferable despite not guaranteeing valid molecules. We raise issues in using the large PubChem dataset of molecules and their associated descriptions for evaluating molecule generation and provide a filtered version of the dataset as a generation test set. To demonstrate how ChemLML could be used in practice, we generate candidate protein inhibitors and use docking to assess their quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to human preferences in content, style, and presentation is challenging, in part because preferences are varied, context-dependent, and sometimes inherently ambiguous. While successful, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are prone to the issue of proxy reward overoptimization. Analysis of the DPO loss reveals a critical need for regularization for mislabeled or ambiguous preference pairs to avoid reward hacking. In this work, we develop a pessimistic framework for DPO by introducing preference uncertainty penalization schemes, inspired by offline reinforcement learning. The penalization serves as a correction to the loss which attenuates the loss gradient for uncertain samples. Evaluation of the methods is performed with GPT2 Medium on the Anthropic-HH dataset using a model ensemble to obtain uncertainty estimates, and shows improved overall performance compared to vanilla DPO, as well as better completions on prompts from high-uncertainty chosen/rejected responses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to reconstructing density fields from shadowgraph images using a physics-informed framework. By integrating traditional shadowgraph imaging techniques with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), we effectively capture refractive index variations within complex flow fields. The proposed method addresses the inherent challenges of shadowgraphy, such as noise and limited spatial resolution, enabling accurate visualization of fluid dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of our approach, with significant agreement observed between the reconstructed density fields and experimental measurements. This research contributes to the advancement of non-intrusive diagnostic techniques in fluid mechanics and enhances our understanding of flow structures in various applications.</description>

Methods: The review defines foundational generative AI concepts and highlights current HEOR applications, including systematic literature reviews, health economic modeling, real-world evidence generation, and dossier development. Approaches such as prompt engineering (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, persona pattern prompting), retrieval-augmented generation, model fine-tuning, and the use of domain-specific models are introduced to improve AI accuracy and reliability. Results: Generative AI shows significant potential in HEOR, enhancing efficiency, productivity, and offering novel solutions to complex challenges. Foundation models are promising in automating complex tasks, though challenges remain in scientific reliability, bias, interpretability, and workflow integration. The article discusses strategies to improve the accuracy of these AI tools. Conclusion: Generative AI could transform HEOR by increasing efficiency and accuracy across various applications. However, its full potential can only be realized by building HEOR expertise and addressing the limitations of current AI technologies. As AI evolves, ongoing research and innovation will shape its future role in the field.</description>

Abstract: Neural Fields have emerged as a transformative approach for 3D scene representation in computer vision and robotics, enabling accurate inference of geometry, 3D semantics, and dynamics from posed 2D data. Leveraging differentiable rendering, Neural Fields encompass both continuous implicit and explicit neural representations enabling high-fidelity 3D reconstruction, integration of multi-modal sensor data, and generation of novel viewpoints. This survey explores their applications in robotics, emphasizing their potential to enhance perception, planning, and control. Their compactness, memory efficiency, and differentiability, along with seamless integration with foundation and generative models, make them ideal for real-time applications, improving robot adaptability and decision-making. This paper provides a thorough review of Neural Fields in robotics, categorizing applications across various domains and evaluating their strengths and limitations, based on over 200 papers. First, we present four key Neural Fields frameworks: Occupancy Networks, Signed Distance Fields, Neural Radiance Fields, and Gaussian Splatting. Second, we detail Neural Fields' applications in five major robotics domains: pose estimation, manipulation, navigation, physics, and autonomous driving, highlighting key works and discussing takeaways and open challenges. Finally, we outline the current limitations of Neural Fields in robotics and propose promising directions for future research. Project page: https://robonerf.github.io</description>

      <title>Modelling of Economic Implications of Bias in AI-Powered Health Emergency Response Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework assessing the economic implications of bias in AI-powered emergency response systems. Integrating health economics, welfare economics, and artificial intelligence, we analyze how algorithmic bias affects resource allocation, health outcomes, and social welfare. By incorporating a bias function into health production and social welfare models, we quantify its impact on demographic groups, showing that bias leads to suboptimal resource distribution, increased costs, and welfare losses. The framework highlights efficiency-equity trade-offs and provides economic interpretations. We propose mitigation strategies, including fairness-constrained optimization, algorithmic adjustments, and policy interventions. Our findings offer insights for policymakers, emergency service providers, and technology developers, emphasizing the need for AI systems that are efficient and equitable. By addressing the economic consequences of biased AI, this study contributes to policies and technologies promoting fairness, efficiency, and social welfare in emergency response services.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey offers a comprehensive overview of Large Language Models (LLMs) designed for Arabic language and its dialects. It covers key architectures, including encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder models, along with the datasets used for pre-training, spanning Classical Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic, and Dialectal Arabic. The study also explores monolingual, bilingual, and multilingual LLMs, analyzing their architectures and performance across downstream tasks, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering. Furthermore, it assesses the openness of Arabic LLMs based on factors, such as source code availability, training data, model weights, and documentation. The survey highlights the need for more diverse dialectal datasets and attributes the importance of openness for research reproducibility and transparency. It concludes by identifying key challenges and opportunities for future research and stressing the need for more inclusive and representative models.</description>

      <title>Improving Model Evaluation using SMART Filtering of Benchmark Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most challenging problems facing NLP today is evaluation. Some of the most pressing issues pertain to benchmark saturation, data contamination, and diversity in the quality of test examples. To address these concerns, we propose Selection Methodology for Accurate, Reduced, and Targeted (SMART) filtering, a novel approach to select a high-quality subset of examples from existing benchmark datasets by systematically removing less informative and less challenging examples. Our approach applies three filtering criteria, removing (i) easy examples, (ii) data-contaminated examples, and (iii) examples that are similar to each other based on distance in an embedding space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMART on three multiple choice QA datasets, where our methodology increases efficiency by reducing dataset size by 48\% on average, while increasing Pearson correlation with rankings from ChatBot Arena, a more open-ended human evaluation setting. Our method enables us to be more efficient, whether using SMART to make new benchmarks more challenging or to revitalize older datasets, while still preserving the relative model rankings.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Video Understanding Agent: Enhancing efficiency with dynamic frame sampling and feedback-driven reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding long-form video content presents significant challenges due to its temporal complexity and the substantial computational resources required. In this work, we propose an agent-based approach to enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of long-form video understanding by utilizing large language models (LLMs) and their tool-harnessing ability. A key aspect of our method is query-adaptive frame sampling, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to process only the most relevant frames in real-time, and addresses an important limitation of existing methods which typically involve sampling redundant or irrelevant frames. To enhance the reasoning abilities of our video-understanding agent, we leverage the self-reflective capabilities of LLMs to provide verbal reinforcement to the agent, which leads to improved performance while minimizing the number of frames accessed. We evaluate our method across several video understanding benchmarks and demonstrate that not only it enhances state-of-the-art performance but also improves efficiency by reducing the number of frames sampled.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Blurring Diffusion for Hierarchical Molecular Conformer Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can diffusion models process 3D geometries in a coarse-to-fine manner, akin to our multiscale view of the world? In this paper, we address the question by focusing on a fundamental biochemical problem of generating 3D molecular conformers conditioned on molecular graphs in a multiscale manner. Our approach consists of two hierarchical stages: i) generation of coarse-grained fragment-level 3D structure from the molecular graph, and ii) generation of fine atomic details from the coarse-grained approximated structure while allowing the latter to be adjusted simultaneously. For the challenging second stage, which demands preserving coarse-grained information while ensuring SE(3) equivariance, we introduce a novel generative model termed Equivariant Blurring Diffusion (EBD), which defines a forward process that moves towards the fragment-level coarse-grained structure by blurring the fine atomic details of conformers, and a reverse process that performs the opposite operation using equivariant networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EBD by geometric and chemical comparison to state-of-the-art denoising diffusion models on a benchmark of drug-like molecules. Ablation studies draw insights on the design of EBD by thoroughly analyzing its architecture, which includes the design of the loss function and the data corruption process. Codes are released at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/EBD .</description>

      <title>EfficientEQA: An Efficient Approach for Open Vocabulary Embodied Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is an essential yet challenging task for robotic home assistants. Recent studies have shown that large vision-language models (VLMs) can be effectively utilized for EQA, but existing works either focus on video-based question answering without embodied exploration or rely on closed-form choice sets. In real-world scenarios, a robotic agent must efficiently explore and accurately answer questions in open-vocabulary settings. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called EfficientEQA for open-vocabulary EQA, which enables efficient exploration and accurate answering. In EfficientEQA, the robot actively explores unknown environments using Semantic-Value-Weighted Frontier Exploration, a strategy that prioritizes exploration based on semantic importance provided by calibrated confidence from black-box VLMs to quickly gather relevant information. To generate accurate answers, we employ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which utilizes BLIP to retrieve useful images from accumulated observations and VLM reasoning to produce responses without relying on predefined answer choices. Additionally, we detect observations that are highly relevant to the question as outliers, allowing the robot to determine when it has sufficient information to stop exploring and provide an answer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing an improvement in answering accuracy by over 15% and efficiency, measured in running steps, by over 20% compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>MarDini: Masked Autoregressive Diffusion for Video Generation at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MarDini, a new family of video diffusion models that integrate the advantages of masked auto-regression (MAR) into a unified diffusion model (DM) framework. Here, MAR handles temporal planning, while DM focuses on spatial generation in an asymmetric network design: i) a MAR-based planning model containing most of the parameters generates planning signals for each masked frame using low-resolution input; ii) a lightweight generation model uses these signals to produce high-resolution frames via diffusion de-noising. MarDini's MAR enables video generation conditioned on any number of masked frames at any frame positions: a single model can handle video interpolation (e.g., masking middle frames), image-to-video generation (e.g., masking from the second frame onward), and video expansion (e.g., masking half the frames). The efficient design allocates most of the computational resources to the low-resolution planning model, making computationally expensive but important spatio-temporal attention feasible at scale. MarDini sets a new state-of-the-art for video interpolation; meanwhile, within few inference steps, it efficiently generates videos on par with those of much more expensive advanced image-to-video models.</description>

Abstract: This study introduces an innovative approach to automating Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) processes in industrial environments by leveraging Microsoft's AI-powered security technologies. Historically, CTI has heavily relied on manual methods for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data from various sources such as threat feeds. This study introduces an innovative approach to automating CTI processes in industrial environments by leveraging Microsoft's AI-powered security technologies. Historically, CTI has heavily relied on manual methods for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data from various sources such as threat feeds, security logs, and dark web forums -- a process prone to inefficiencies, especially when rapid information dissemination is critical. By employing the capabilities of GPT-4o and advanced one-shot fine-tuning techniques for large language models, our research delivers a novel CTI automation solution. The outcome of the proposed architecture is a reduction in manual effort while maintaining precision in generating final CTI reports. This research highlights the transformative potential of AI-driven technologies to enhance both the speed and accuracy of CTI and reduce expert demands, offering a vital advantage in today's dynamic threat landscape.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning and Evaluating Open-Source Large Language Models for the Army Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in their potential for application within the military domain. However, the current generation of LLMs demonstrate sub-optimal performance on Army use cases, due to the prevalence of domain-specific vocabulary and jargon. In order to fully leverage LLMs in-domain, many organizations have turned to fine-tuning to circumvent the prohibitive costs involved in training new LLMs from scratch. In light of this trend, we explore the viability of adapting open-source LLMs for usage in the Army domain in order to address their existing lack of domain-specificity. Our investigations have resulted in the creation of three distinct generations of TRACLM, a family of LLMs fine-tuned by The Research and Analysis Center (TRAC), Army Futures Command (AFC). Through continuous refinement of our training pipeline, each successive iteration of TRACLM displayed improved capabilities when applied to Army tasks and use cases. Furthermore, throughout our fine-tuning experiments, we recognized the need for an evaluation framework that objectively quantifies the Army domain-specific knowledge of LLMs. To address this, we developed MilBench, an extensible software framework that efficiently evaluates the Army knowledge of a given LLM using tasks derived from doctrine and assessments. We share preliminary results, models, methods, and recommendations on the creation of TRACLM and MilBench. Our work significantly informs the development of LLM technology across the DoD and augments senior leader decisions with respect to artificial intelligence integration.</description>

      <title>Learning from Response not Preference: A Stackelberg Approach for LLM Detoxification using Non-parallel Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text detoxification, a variant of style transfer tasks, finds useful applications in online social media. This work presents a fine-tuning method that only uses non-parallel data to turn large language models (LLM) into a detoxification rewritter. We model the fine-tuning process as a Stackelberg game between an LLM (leader) and a toxicity screener (follower), which is a binary style classifier (toxic or non-toxic). The LLM aims to align its preference according to the screener and generate paraphases passing the screening. The primary challenge of non-parallel data fine-tuning is incomplete preference. In the case of unsuccessful paraphrases, the classifier cannot establish a preference between the input and paraphrase, as they belong to the same toxic style. Hence, preference-alignment fine-tuning methods, such as direct preference optimization (DPO), no longer apply. To address the challenge of incomplete preference, we propose Stackelberg response optimization (SRO), adapted from DPO, to enable the LLM to learn from the follower's response. The gist is that SRO decreases the likelihood of generating the paraphrase if it fails the follower's screening while performing DPO on the pair of the toxic input and its paraphrase when the latter passes the screening. Experiments indicate that the SRO-fine-tunned LLM achieves satisfying performance comparable to state-of-the-art models regarding style accuracy, content similarity, and fluency. The overall detoxification performance surpasses other computing methods and matches the human reference. Additional empirical evidence suggests that SRO is sensitive to the screener's feedback, and a slight perturbation leads to a significant performance drop. We release the code and LLM models at \url{https://github.com/XXXinhong/Detoxification_LLM}.</description>

      <title>Sequential Large Language Model-Based Hyper-Parameter Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces SLLMBO, an innovative framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization (HPO), incorporating dynamic search space adaptability, enhanced parameter landscape exploitation, and a hybrid, novel LLM-Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (LLM-TPE) sampler. By addressing limitations in recent fully LLM-based methods and traditional Bayesian Optimization (BO), SLLMBO achieves more robust optimization. This comprehensive benchmarking evaluates multiple LLMs, including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet-3.5, and Gemini-1.5-flash, extending prior work beyond GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and establishing SLLMBO as the first framework to benchmark a diverse set of LLMs for HPO. By integrating LLMs' established strengths in parameter initialization with the exploitation abilities demonstrated in this study, alongside TPE's exploration capabilities, the LLM-TPE sampler achieves a balanced exploration-exploitation trade-off, reduces API costs, and mitigates premature early stoppings for more effective parameter searches. Across 14 tabular tasks in classification and regression, the LLM-TPE sampler outperformed fully LLM-based methods and achieved superior results over BO methods in 9 tasks. Testing early stopping in budget-constrained scenarios further demonstrated competitive performance, indicating that LLM-based methods generally benefit from extended iterations for optimal results. This work lays the foundation for future research exploring open-source LLMs, reproducibility of LLM results in HPO, and benchmarking SLLMBO on complex datasets, such as image classification, segmentation, and machine translation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Community Vision Screening -- AI Driven Retinal Photography for Early Disease Detection and Patient Trust</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community vision screening plays a crucial role in identifying individuals with vision loss and preventing avoidable blindness, particularly in rural communities where access to eye care services is limited. Currently, there is a pressing need for a simple and efficient process to screen and refer individuals with significant eye disease-related vision loss to tertiary eye care centers for further care. An ideal solution should seamlessly and readily integrate with existing workflows, providing comprehensive initial screening results to service providers, thereby enabling precise patient referrals for timely treatment. This paper introduces the Enhancing Community Vision Screening (ECVS) solution, which addresses the aforementioned concerns with a novel and feasible solution based on simple, non-invasive retinal photography for the detection of pathology-based visual impairment. Our study employs four distinct deep learning models: RETinal photo Quality Assessment (RETQA), Pathology Visual Impairment detection (PVI), Eye Disease Diagnosis (EDD) and Visualization of Lesion Regions of the eye (VLR). We conducted experiments on over 10 datasets, totaling more than 80,000 fundus photos collected from various sources. The models integrated into ECVS achieved impressive AUC scores of 0.98 for RETQA, 0.95 for PVI, and 0.90 for EDD, along with a DICE coefficient of 0.48 for VLR. These results underscore the promising capabilities of ECVS as a straightforward and scalable method for community-based vision screening.</description>

      <title>ANOMIX: A Simple yet Effective Hard Negative Generation via Mixing for Graph Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) generally requires a large number of samples. The one of the effective ways to reduce the number of samples is using hard negatives (e.g., Mixup). Designing mixing-based approach for GAD can be difficult due to imbalanced data or limited number of anomalies. We propose ANOMIX, a framework that consists of a novel graph mixing approach, ANOMIX-M, and multi-level contrasts for GAD. ANOMIX-M can effectively mix abnormality and normality from input graph to generate hard negatives, which are important for efficient GCL. ANOMIX is (a) A first mixing approach: firstly attempting graph mixing to generate hard negatives for GAD task and node- and subgraph-level contrasts to distinguish underlying anomalies. (b) Accurate: winning the highest AUC, up to 5.49% higher and 1.76% faster. (c) Effective: reducing the number of samples nearly 80% in GCL.

Abstract: Dense retrievers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various information retrieval tasks, but their robustness against tokenizer poisoning remains underexplored. In this work, we assess the vulnerability of dense retrieval systems to poisoned tokenizers by evaluating models such as BERT, Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR), Contriever, SimCSE, and ANCE. We find that supervised models like BERT and DPR experience significant performance degradation when tokenizers are compromised, while unsupervised models like ANCE show greater resilience. Our experiments reveal that even small perturbations can severely impact retrieval accuracy, highlighting the need for robust defenses in critical applications.</description>

      <title>Few-shot Open Relation Extraction with Gaussian Prototype and Adaptive Margin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-shot relation extraction with none-of-the-above (FsRE with NOTA) aims at predicting labels in few-shot scenarios with unknown classes. FsRE with NOTA is more challenging than the conventional few-shot relation extraction task, since the boundaries of unknown classes are complex and difficult to learn. Meta-learning based methods, especially prototype-based methods, are the mainstream solutions to this task. They obtain the classification boundary by learning the sample distribution of each class. However, their performance is limited because few-shot overfitting and NOTA boundary confusion lead to misclassification between known and unknown classes. To this end, we propose a novel framework based on Gaussian prototype and adaptive margin named GPAM for FsRE with NOTA, which includes three modules, semi-factual representation, GMM-prototype metric learning and decision boundary learning. The first two modules obtain better representations to solve the few-shot problem through debiased information enhancement and Gaussian space distance measurement. The third module learns more accurate classification boundaries and prototypes through adaptive margin and negative sampling. In the training procedure of GPAM, we use contrastive learning loss to comprehensively consider the effects of range and margin on the classification of known and unknown classes to ensure the model's stability and robustness. Sufficient experiments and ablations on the FewRel dataset show that GPAM surpasses previous prototype methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>R-LLaVA: Improving Med-VQA Understanding through Visual Region of Interest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made significant strides in medical visual question answering (Med-VQA), yet prevalent studies often interpret images holistically, overlooking the visual regions of interest that may contain crucial information, potentially aligning with a doctor's prior knowledge that can be incorporated with minimal annotations (e.g., bounding boxes). To address this gap, this paper introduces R-LLaVA, designed to enhance biomedical VQA understanding by integrating simple medical annotations as prior knowledge directly into the image space through CLIP. These annotated visual regions of interest are then fed into the LLaVA model during training, aiming to enrich the model's understanding of biomedical queries. Experimental evaluation on four standard Med-VQA datasets demonstrates R-LLaVA's superiority over existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods. Additionally, to verify the model's capability in visual comprehension, a novel multiple-choice medical visual understanding dataset is introduced, confirming the positive impact of focusing on visual regions of interest in advancing biomedical VQA understanding.</description>

      <title>Get Large Language Models Ready to Speak: A Late-fusion Approach for Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) with impressive performance across various text-based tasks. However, the extension of text-dominant LLMs to with speech generation tasks remains under-explored. In this work, we introduce a text-to-speech (TTS) system powered by a fine-tuned Llama model, named TTS-Llama, that achieves state-of-the-art speech synthesis performance. Building on TTS-Llama, we further propose MoLE-Llama, a text-and-speech multimodal LLM developed through purely late-fusion parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and a mixture-of-expert architecture. Extensive empirical results demonstrate MoLE-Llama's competitive performance on both text-only question-answering (QA) and TTS tasks, mitigating catastrophic forgetting issue in either modality. Finally, we further explore MoLE-Llama in text-in-speech-out QA tasks, demonstrating its great potential as a multimodal dialog system capable of speech generation.</description>

      <title>Maintaining Informative Coherence: Migrating Hallucinations in Large Language Models via Absorbing Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for text generation, translation, and summarization, but they often suffer from hallucinations-instances where they fail to maintain the fidelity and coherence of contextual information during decoding, sometimes overlooking critical details due to their sampling strategies and inherent biases from training data and fine-tuning discrepancies. These hallucinations can propagate through the web, affecting the trustworthiness of information disseminated online. To address this issue, we propose a novel decoding strategy that leverages absorbing Markov chains to quantify the significance of contextual information and measure the extent of information loss during generation. By considering all possible paths from the first to the last token, our approach enhances the reliability of model outputs without requiring additional training or external data. Evaluations on datasets including TruthfulQA, FACTOR, and HaluEval highlight the superior performance of our method in mitigating hallucinations, underscoring the necessity of ensuring accurate information flow in web-based applications.</description>

      <title>Historical Test-time Prompt Tuning for Vision Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning, which learns prompts online with unlabelled test samples during the inference stage, has demonstrated great potential by learning effective prompts on-the-fly without requiring any task-specific annotations. However, its performance often degrades clearly along the tuning process when the prompts are continuously updated with the test data flow, and the degradation becomes more severe when the domain of test samples changes continuously. We propose HisTPT, a Historical Test-time Prompt Tuning technique that memorizes the useful knowledge of the learnt test samples and enables robust test-time prompt tuning with the memorized knowledge. HisTPT introduces three types of knowledge banks, namely, local knowledge bank, hard-sample knowledge bank, and global knowledge bank, each of which works with different mechanisms for effective knowledge memorization and test-time prompt optimization. In addition, HisTPT features an adaptive knowledge retrieval mechanism that regularizes the prediction of each test sample by adaptively retrieving the memorized knowledge. Extensive experiments show that HisTPT achieves superior prompt tuning performance consistently while handling different visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection) and test samples from continuously changing domains.</description>

      <title>Idempotent Unsupervised Representation Learning for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models, as a powerful technique for generation, also gradually become a critical tool for recognition tasks. However, in skeleton-based action recognition, the features obtained from existing pre-trained generative methods contain redundant information unrelated to recognition, which contradicts the nature of the skeleton's spatially sparse and temporally consistent properties, leading to undesirable performance. To address this challenge, we make efforts to bridge the gap in theory and methodology and propose a novel skeleton-based idempotent generative model (IGM) for unsupervised representation learning. More specifically, we first theoretically demonstrate the equivalence between generative models and maximum entropy coding, which demonstrates a potential route that makes the features of generative models more compact by introducing contrastive learning. To this end, we introduce the idempotency constraint to form a stronger consistency regularization in the feature space, to push the features only to maintain the critical information of motion semantics for the recognition task. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, NTU RGB+D and PKUMMD, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. On the NTU 60 xsub dataset, we observe a performance improvement from 84.6$\%$ to 86.2$\%$. Furthermore, in zero-shot adaptation scenarios, our model demonstrates significant efficacy by achieving promising results in cases that were previously unrecognizable.

Abstract: Melody stuck in your head, also known as "earworm", is tough to get rid of, unless you listen to it again or sing it out loud. But what if you can not find the name of that song? It must be an intolerable feeling. Recognizing a song name base on humming sound is not an easy task for a human being and should be done by machines. However, there is no research paper published about hum tune recognition. Adapting from Hum2Song Zalo AI Challenge 2021 - a competition about querying the name of a song by user's giving humming tune, which is similar to Google's Hum to Search. This paper covers details about the pre-processed data from the original type (mp3) to usable form for training and inference. In training an embedding model for the feature extraction phase, we ran experiments with some states of the art, such as ResNet, VGG, AlexNet, MobileNetV2. And for the inference phase, we use the Faiss module to effectively search for a song that matched the sequence of humming sound. The result comes at nearly 94\% in MRR@10 metric on the public test set, along with the top 1 result on the public leaderboard.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Capabilities of Model Pruning in Graph Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph contrastive learning has achieved great success in pre-training graph neural networks without ground-truth labels. Leading graph contrastive learning follows the classical scheme of contrastive learning, forcing model to identify the essential information from augmented views. However, general augmented views are produced via random corruption or learning, which inevitably leads to semantics alteration. Although domain knowledge guided augmentations alleviate this issue, the generated views are domain specific and undermine the generalization. In this work, motivated by the firm representation ability of sparse model from pruning, we reformulate the problem of graph contrastive learning via contrasting different model versions rather than augmented views. We first theoretically reveal the superiority of model pruning in contrast to data augmentations. In practice, we take original graph as input and dynamically generate a perturbed graph encoder to contrast with the original encoder by pruning its transformation weights. Furthermore, considering the integrity of node embedding in our method, we are capable of developing a local contrastive loss to tackle the hard negative samples that disturb the model training. We extensively validate our method on various benchmarks regarding graph classification via unsupervised and transfer learning. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) works, better performance can always be obtained by the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Dynamics as Prompts: In-Context Learning for Sim-to-Real System Identifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer remains a significant challenge in robotics due to the discrepancies between simulated and real-world dynamics. Traditional methods like Domain Randomization often fail to capture fine-grained dynamics, limiting their effectiveness for precise control tasks. In this work, we propose a novel approach that dynamically adjusts simulation environment parameters online using in-context learning. By leveraging past interaction histories as context, our method adapts the simulation environment dynamics to real-world dynamics without requiring gradient updates, resulting in faster and more accurate alignment between simulated and real-world performance. We validate our approach across two tasks: object scooping and table air hockey. In the sim-to-sim evaluations, our method significantly outperforms the baselines on environment parameter estimation by 80% and 42% in the object scooping and table air hockey setups, respectively. Furthermore, our method achieves at least 70% success rate in sim-to-real transfer on object scooping across three different objects. By incorporating historical interaction data, our approach delivers efficient and smooth system identification, advancing the deployment of robots in dynamic real-world scenarios. Demos are available on our project page: https://sim2real-capture.github.io/</description>

      <title>RopeTP: Global Human Motion Recovery via Integrating Robust Pose Estimation with Diffusion Trajectory Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present RopeTP, a novel framework that combines Robust pose estimation with a diffusion Trajectory Prior to reconstruct global human motion from videos. At the heart of RopeTP is a hierarchical attention mechanism that significantly improves context awareness, which is essential for accurately inferring the posture of occluded body parts. This is achieved by exploiting the relationships with visible anatomical structures, enhancing the accuracy of local pose estimations. The improved robustness of these local estimations allows for the reconstruction of precise and stable global trajectories. Additionally, RopeTP incorporates a diffusion trajectory model that predicts realistic human motion from local pose sequences. This model ensures that the generated trajectories are not only consistent with observed local actions but also unfold naturally over time, thereby improving the realism and stability of 3D human motion reconstruction. Extensive experimental validation shows that RopeTP surpasses current methods on two benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in scenarios with occlusions. It also outperforms methods that rely on SLAM for initial camera estimates and extensive optimization, delivering more accurate and realistic trajectories.</description>

      <title>Conditional GAN for Enhancing Diffusion Models in Efficient and Authentic Global Gesture Generation from Audios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-driven simultaneous gesture generation is vital for human-computer communication, AI games, and film production. While previous research has shown promise, there are still limitations. Methods based on VAEs are accompanied by issues of local jitter and global instability, whereas methods based on diffusion models are hampered by low generation efficiency. This is because the denoising process of DDPM in the latter relies on the assumption that the noise added at each step is sampled from a unimodal distribution, and the noise values are small. DDIM borrows the idea from the Euler method for solving differential equations, disrupts the Markov chain process, and increases the noise step size to reduce the number of denoising steps, thereby accelerating generation. However, simply increasing the step size during the step-by-step denoising process causes the results to gradually deviate from the original data distribution, leading to a significant drop in the quality of the generated actions and the emergence of unnatural artifacts. In this paper, we break the assumptions of DDPM and achieves breakthrough progress in denoising speed and fidelity. Specifically, we introduce a conditional GAN to capture audio control signals and implicitly match the multimodal denoising distribution between the diffusion and denoising steps within the same sampling step, aiming to sample larger noise values and apply fewer denoising steps for high-speed generation.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Data Synthesis: A Teacher Model Training Recipe with Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) training have highlighted the need for diverse, high-quality instruction data. Recently, many works are exploring synthetic data generation using LLMs. However, they primarily focus on prompt engineering with standard supervised instruction-finetuned models, which contains a fundamental limitation: these models are optimized for general question-answering/problem-solving rather than data generation. We propose a paradigm shift named \textbf{NOMAD} by investigating how to specifically train models for data generation, demonstrating that this task differs significantly from training a classical LM. We identify two key factors: no-prompt-masked training and proper training set size selection. Our method, NOMAD, shows substantial improvements over baselines, achieving &gt;4\% gains in TriviaQA and &gt;2\% in GSM8K with limited training data. Finally, we offer new insights by interpreting synthetic data through the lenses of "relevance" and "novelty".</description>

      <title>Open-Vocabulary Object Detection via Language Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on generalizable object detection have attracted increasing attention with additional weak supervision from large-scale datasets with image-level labels. However, weakly-supervised detection learning often suffers from image-to-box label mismatch, i.e., image-level labels do not convey precise object information. We design Language Hierarchical Self-training (LHST) that introduces language hierarchy into weakly-supervised detector training for learning more generalizable detectors. LHST expands the image-level labels with language hierarchy and enables co-regularization between the expanded labels and self-training. Specifically, the expanded labels regularize self-training by providing richer supervision and mitigating the image-to-box label mismatch, while self-training allows assessing and selecting the expanded labels according to the predicted reliability. In addition, we design language hierarchical prompt generation that introduces language hierarchy into prompt generation which helps bridge the vocabulary gaps between training and testing. Extensive experiments show that the proposed techniques achieve superior generalization performance consistently across 14 widely studied object detection datasets.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-shot Federated Learning (OFL) significantly reduces communication costs in FL by aggregating trained models only once. However, the performance of advanced OFL methods is far behind the normal FL. In this work, we provide a causal view to find that this performance drop of OFL methods comes from the isolation problem, which means that local isolatedly trained models in OFL may easily fit to spurious correlations due to the data heterogeneity. From the causal perspective, we observe that the spurious fitting can be alleviated by augmenting intermediate features from other clients. Built upon our observation, we propose a novel learning approach to endow OFL with superb performance and low communication and storage costs, termed as FuseFL. Specifically, FuseFL decomposes neural networks into several blocks, and progressively trains and fuses each block following a bottom-up manner for feature augmentation, introducing no additional communication costs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FuseFL outperforms existing OFL and ensemble FL by a significant margin. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that FuseFL supports high scalability of clients, heterogeneous model training, and low memory costs. Our work is the first attempt using causality to analyze and alleviate data heterogeneity of OFL.</description>

      <title>Multiple kernel concept factorization algorithm based on global fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-negative Matrix Factorization(NMF) algorithm can only be used to find low rank approximation of original non-negative data while Concept Factorization(CF) algorithm extends matrix factorization to single non-linear kernel space, improving learning ability and adaptability of matrix factorization. In unsupervised environment, to design or select proper kernel function for specific dataset, a new algorithm called Globalized Multiple Kernel CF(GMKCF)was proposed. Multiple candidate kernel functions were input in the same time and learned in the CF framework based on global linear fusion, obtaining a clustering result with high quality and stability and solving the problem of kernel function selection that the CF faced. The convergence of the proposed algorithm was verified by solving the model with alternate iteration. The experimental results on several real databases show that the proposed algorithm outperforms comparison algorithms in data clustering, such as Kernel K-Means(KKM), Spectral Clustering(SC), Kernel CF(KCF), Co-regularized multi-view spectral clustering(Coreg), and Robust Multiple KKM(RMKKM).</description>

      <title>Addressing the Pitfalls of Image-Based Structural Health Monitoring: A Focus on False Positives, False Negatives, and Base Rate Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the limitations of image-based structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques in detecting structural damage. Leveraging machine learning and computer vision, image-based SHM offers a scalable and efficient alternative to manual inspections. However, its reliability is impacted by challenges such as false positives, false negatives, and environmental variability, particularly in low base rate damage scenarios. The Base Rate Bias plays a significant role, as low probabilities of actual damage often lead to misinterpretation of positive results. This study uses both Bayesian analysis and a frequentist approach to evaluate the precision of damage detection systems, revealing that even highly accurate models can yield misleading results when the occurrence of damage is rare. Strategies for mitigating these limitations are discussed, including hybrid systems that combine multiple data sources, human-in-the-loop approaches for critical assessments, and improving the quality of training data. These findings provide essential insights into the practical applicability of image-based SHM techniques, highlighting both their potential and their limitations for real-world infrastructure monitoring.</description>

      <title>Lodge++: High-quality and Long Dance Generation with Vivid Choreography Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Lodge++, a choreography framework to generate high-quality, ultra-long, and vivid dances given the music and desired genre. To handle the challenges in computational efficiency, the learning of complex and vivid global choreography patterns, and the physical quality of local dance movements, Lodge++ adopts a two-stage strategy to produce dances from coarse to fine. In the first stage, a global choreography network is designed to generate coarse-grained dance primitives that capture complex global choreography patterns. In the second stage, guided by these dance primitives, a primitive-based dance diffusion model is proposed to further generate high-quality, long-sequence dances in parallel, faithfully adhering to the complex choreography patterns. Additionally, to improve the physical plausibility, Lodge++ employs a penetration guidance module to resolve character self-penetration, a foot refinement module to optimize foot-ground contact, and a multi-genre discriminator to maintain genre consistency throughout the dance. Lodge++ is validated by extensive experiments, which show that our method can rapidly generate ultra-long dances suitable for various dance genres, ensuring well-organized global choreography patterns and high-quality local motion.</description>

      <title>ThunderKittens: Simple, Fast, and Adorable AI Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenge of mapping AI architectures to GPU hardware is creating a critical bottleneck in AI progress. Despite substantial efforts, hand-written custom kernels fail to meet their theoretical performance thresholds, even on well-established operations like linear attention. The diverse hardware capabilities of GPUs might suggest that we need a wide variety of techniques to achieve high performance. However, our work explores whether a small number of key abstractions can drastically simplify the process. We present ThunderKittens (TK), a framework for writing performant AI kernels while remaining easy to use and maintain. Our abstractions map to the three levels of the GPU hierarchy: (1) at the warp-level, we provide 16x16 matrix tiles as basic data structures and PyTorch-like parallel compute operations over tiles, (2) at the thread-block level, we provide a template for overlapping asynchronous operations across parallel warps, and (3) at the grid-level, we provide support to help hide the block launch and tear-down, and memory costs. We show the value of TK by providing kernels that match or outperform prior kernels for a range of AI operations. We match CuBLAS and FlashAttention-3 on GEMM and attention inference performance and outperform the strongest baselines by $10-40\%$ on attention backwards, $8\times$ on state space models, and $14\times$ on linear attention.</description>

      <title>Inevitable Trade-off between Watermark Strength and Speculative Sampling Efficiency for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models are probabilistic models, and the process of generating content is essentially sampling from the output distribution of the language model. Existing watermarking techniques inject watermarks into the generated content without altering the output quality. On the other hand, existing acceleration techniques, specifically speculative sampling, leverage a draft model to speed up the sampling process while preserving the output distribution. However, there is no known method to simultaneously accelerate the sampling process and inject watermarks into the generated content. In this paper, we investigate this direction and find that the integration of watermarking and acceleration is non-trivial. We prove a no-go theorem, which states that it is impossible to simultaneously maintain the highest watermark strength and the highest sampling efficiency. Furthermore, we propose two methods that maintain either the sampling efficiency or the watermark strength, but not both. Our work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for understanding the inherent trade-off between watermark strength and sampling efficiency in accelerating the generation of watermarked tokens for large language models. We also conduct numerical experiments to validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>NT-VOT211: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Night-time Visual Object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many current visual object tracking benchmarks such as OTB100, NfS, UAV123, LaSOT, and GOT-10K, predominantly contain day-time scenarios while the challenges posed by the night-time has been less investigated. It is primarily because of the lack of a large-scale, well-annotated night-time benchmark for rigorously evaluating tracking algorithms. To this end, this paper presents NT-VOT211, a new benchmark tailored for evaluating visual object tracking algorithms in the challenging night-time conditions. NT-VOT211 consists of 211 diverse videos, offering 211,000 well-annotated frames with 8 attributes including camera motion, deformation, fast motion, motion blur, tiny target, distractors, occlusion and out-of-view. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest night-time tracking benchmark to-date that is specifically designed to address unique challenges such as adverse visibility, image blur, and distractors inherent to night-time tracking scenarios. Through a comprehensive analysis of results obtained from 42 diverse tracking algorithms on NT-VOT211, we uncover the strengths and limitations of these algorithms, highlighting opportunities for enhancements in visual object tracking, particularly in environments with suboptimal lighting. Besides, a leaderboard for revealing performance rankings, annotation tools, comprehensive meta-information and all the necessary code for reproducibility of results is made publicly available. We believe that our NT-VOT211 benchmark will not only be instrumental in facilitating field deployment of VOT algorithms, but will also help VOT enhancements and it will unlock new real-world tracking applications.

Abstract: Large models are a hot research topic in the field of artificial intelligence. Leveraging their generative capabilities has the potential to enhance the level and quality of medical services. In response to the limitations of current large language models, which often struggle with accuracy and have narrow capabilities in medical applications, this paper presents a Chinese medical large language model, MedGo. MedGo was trained using a combination of high quality unsupervised medical data, supervised data, and preference alignment data, aimed at enhancing both its versatility and precision in medical tasks. The model was evaluated through the public CBLUE benchmark and a manually constructed dataset ClinicalQA. The results demonstrate that MedGo achieved promising performance across various Chinese medical information processing tasks, achieved the first place in the CBLUE evaluation. Additionally, on our constructed dataset ClinicalQA, MedGo outperformed its base model Qwen2, highlighting its potential to improve both automated medical question answering and clinical decision support. These experimental results demonstrate that MedGo possesses strong information processing capabilities in the medical field. At present, we have successfully deployed MedGo at Shanghai East Hospital.</description>

      <title>TEAFormers: TEnsor-Augmented Transformers for Multi-Dimensional Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-dimensional time series data, such as matrix and tensor-variate time series, are increasingly prevalent in fields such as economics, finance, and climate science. Traditional Transformer models, though adept with sequential data, do not effectively preserve these multi-dimensional structures, as their internal operations in effect flatten multi-dimensional observations into vectors, thereby losing critical multi-dimensional relationships and patterns. To address this, we introduce the Tensor-Augmented Transformer (TEAFormer), a novel method that incorporates tensor expansion and compression within the Transformer framework to maintain and leverage the inherent multi-dimensional structures, thus reducing computational costs and improving prediction accuracy. The core feature of the TEAFormer, the Tensor-Augmentation (TEA) module, utilizes tensor expansion to enhance multi-view feature learning and tensor compression for efficient information aggregation and reduced computational load. The TEA module is not just a specific model architecture but a versatile component that is highly compatible with the attention mechanism and the encoder-decoder structure of Transformers, making it adaptable to existing Transformer architectures. Our comprehensive experiments, which integrate the TEA module into three popular time series Transformer models across three real-world benchmarks, show significant performance enhancements, highlighting the potential of TEAFormers for cutting-edge time series forecasting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory modeling, which includes research on trajectory data pattern mining and future prediction, has widespread applications in areas such as life services, urban transportation, and public administration. Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modelling. However, due to the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks, achieving unified trajectory modelling remains an important yet challenging task. In this paper, we propose TrajAgent, a large language model-based agentic framework, to unify various trajectory modelling tasks. In TrajAgent, we first develop UniEnv, an execution environment with a unified data and model interface, to support the execution and training of various models. Building on UniEnv, we introduce TAgent, an agentic workflow designed for automatic trajectory modelling across various trajectory tasks. Specifically, we design AutOpt, a systematic optimization module within TAgent, to further improve the performance of the integrated model. With diverse trajectory tasks input in natural language, TrajAgent automatically generates competitive results via training and executing appropriate models. Extensive experiments on four tasks using four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TrajAgent in unified trajectory modelling, achieving an average performance improvement of 15.43% over baseline methods.</description>

Abstract: This study presents the ``Arabic Derivational ChainBank,'' a novel framework for modeling Arabic derivational morphology. It establishes connections between forms and meanings by constructing a chain of derived words that reflect their derivational significance. To expedite the process, a rule-based methodology was employed, avoiding time-consuming manual annotation. The derivational network was then aligned with the CamelMorph morphological analyzer database. This two-step process resulted in a chain of derived word lemmas linked to their roots, encompassing 23,333 evaluated derivational relations, thereby demonstrating the efficiency of the ChainBank.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MusicFlow, a cascaded text-to-music generation model based on flow matching. Based on self-supervised representations to bridge between text descriptions and music audios, we construct two flow matching networks to model the conditional distribution of semantic and acoustic features. Additionally, we leverage masked prediction as the training objective, enabling the model to generalize to other tasks such as music infilling and continuation in a zero-shot manner. Experiments on MusicCaps reveal that the music generated by MusicFlow exhibits superior quality and text coherence despite being over $2\sim5$ times smaller and requiring $5$ times fewer iterative steps. Simultaneously, the model can perform other music generation tasks and achieves competitive performance in music infilling and continuation. Our code and model will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>What Factors Affect Multi-Modal In-Context Learning? An In-Depth Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, rapid advancements in Multi-Modal In-Context Learning (MM-ICL) have achieved notable success, which is capable of achieving superior performance across various tasks without requiring additional parameter tuning. However, the underlying rules for the effectiveness of MM-ICL remain under-explored. To fill this gap, this work aims to investigate the research question: "What factors affect the performance of MM-ICL?'' To this end, we investigate extensive experiments on the three core steps of MM-ICL including demonstration retrieval, demonstration ordering, and prompt construction using 6 vision large language models and 20 strategies. Our findings highlight (1) the necessity of a multi-modal retriever for demonstration retrieval, (2) the importance of intra-demonstration ordering over inter-demonstration ordering, and (3) the enhancement of task comprehension through introductory instructions in prompts. We hope this study can serve as a foundational guide for optimizing MM-ICL strategies in future research.</description>

      <title>Improving Decision Sparsity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparsity is a central aspect of interpretability in machine learning. Typically, sparsity is measured in terms of the size of a model globally, such as the number of variables it uses. However, this notion of sparsity is not particularly relevant for decision-making; someone subjected to a decision does not care about variables that do not contribute to the decision. In this work, we dramatically expand a notion of decision sparsity called the Sparse Explanation Value(SEV) so that its explanations are more meaningful. SEV considers movement along a hypercube towards a reference point. By allowing flexibility in that reference and by considering how distances along the hypercube translate to distances in feature space, we can derive sparser and more meaningful explanations for various types of function classes. We present cluster-based SEV and its variant tree-based SEV, introduce a method that improves credibility of explanations, and propose algorithms that optimize decision sparsity in machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Efficient Diversity-based Experience Replay for Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in solving complex decision-making problems by combining the representation capabilities of deep learning with the decision-making power of reinforcement learning. However, learning in sparse reward environments remains challenging due to insufficient feedback to guide the optimization of agents, especially in real-life environments with high-dimensional states. To tackle this issue, experience replay is commonly introduced to enhance learning efficiency through past experiences. Nonetheless, current methods of experience replay, whether based on uniform or prioritized sampling, frequently struggle with suboptimal learning efficiency and insufficient utilization of samples. This paper proposes a novel approach, diversity-based experience replay (DBER), which leverages the deterministic point process to prioritize diverse samples in state realizations. We conducted extensive experiments on Robotic Manipulation tasks in MuJoCo, Atari games, and realistic in-door environments in Habitat. The results show that our method not only significantly improves learning efficiency but also demonstrates superior performance in sparse reward environments with high-dimensional states, providing a simple yet effective solution for this field.</description>

      <title>$\textit{Who Speaks Matters}$: Analysing the Influence of the Speaker's Ethnicity on Hate Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a lucrative promise for scalable content moderation, including hate speech detection. However, they are also known to be brittle and biased against marginalised communities and dialects. This requires their applications to high-stakes tasks like hate speech detection to be critically scrutinized. In this work, we investigate the robustness of hate speech classification using LLMs, particularly when explicit and implicit markers of the speaker's ethnicity are injected into the input. For the explicit markers, we inject a phrase that mentions the speaker's identity. For the implicit markers, we inject dialectal features. By analysing how frequently model outputs flip in the presence of these markers, we reveal varying degrees of brittleness across 4 popular LLMs and 5 ethnicities. We find that the presence of implicit dialect markers in inputs causes model outputs to flip more than the presence of explicit markers. Further, the percentage of flips varies across ethnicities. Finally, we find that larger models are more robust. Our findings indicate the need for exercising caution in deploying LLMs for high-stakes tasks like hate speech detection.</description>

Abstract: We propose protected pipelines or props for short, a new approach for authenticated, privacy-preserving access to deep-web data for machine learning (ML). By permitting secure use of vast sources of deep-web data, props address the systemic bottleneck of limited high-quality training data in ML development. Props also enable privacy-preserving and trustworthy forms of inference, allowing for safe use of sensitive data in ML applications. Props are practically realizable today by leveraging privacy-preserving oracle systems initially developed for blockchain applications.</description>

      <title>CodeRosetta: Pushing the Boundaries of Unsupervised Code Translation for Parallel Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have renewed interest in automatic programming language translation. Encoder-decoder transformer models, in particular, have shown promise in translating between different programming languages. However, translating between a language and its high-performance computing (HPC) extensions remains underexplored due to challenges such as complex parallel semantics. In this paper, we introduce CodeRosetta, an encoder-decoder transformer model designed specifically for translating between programming languages and their HPC extensions. CodeRosetta is evaluated on C++ to CUDA and Fortran to C++ translation tasks. It uses a customized learning framework with tailored pretraining and training objectives to effectively capture both code semantics and parallel structural nuances, enabling bidirectional translation. Our results show that CodeRosetta outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in C++ to CUDA translation by 2.9 BLEU and 1.72 CodeBLEU points while improving compilation accuracy by 6.05%. Compared to general closed-source LLMs, our method improves C++ to CUDA translation by 22.08 BLEU and 14.39 CodeBLEU, with 2.75% higher compilation accuracy. Finally, CodeRosetta exhibits proficiency in Fortran to parallel C++ translation, marking it, to our knowledge, as the first encoder-decoder model for this complex task, improving CodeBLEU by at least 4.63 points compared to closed-source and open-code LLMs.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Perception Machine For Efficient Test-Time-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose Asynchronous Perception Machine (APM), a computationally-efficient architecture for test-time-training (TTT). APM can process patches of an image one at a time in any order \textit{asymmetrically,} and \textit{still encode} semantic-awareness in the net. We demonstrate APM's ability to recognize out-of-distribution images \textit{without} dataset-specific pre-training, augmentation or any-pretext task. APM offers competitive performance over existing TTT approaches. To perform TTT, APM just distills test sample's representation \textit{once}. APM possesses a unique property: it can learn using just this single representation and starts predicting semantically-aware features.
  APM demostrates potential applications beyond test-time-training: APM can scale up to a dataset of 2D images and yield semantic-clusterings in a single forward pass. APM also provides first empirical evidence towards validating GLOM's insight, i.e. input percept is a field. Therefore, APM helps us converge towards an implementation which can do \textit{both} interpolation and perception on a \textit{shared}-connectionist hardware. Our code is publicly available at this link: https://github.com/rajatmodi62/apm.</description>

      <title>Malinowski in the Age of AI: Can large language models create a text game based on an anthropological classic?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 have shown remarkable abilities in a wide range of tasks such as summarizing texts and assisting in coding. Scientific research has demonstrated that these models can also play text-adventure games. This study aims to explore whether LLMs can autonomously create text-based games based on anthropological classics, evaluating also their effectiveness in communicating knowledge. To achieve this, the study engaged anthropologists in discussions to gather their expectations and design inputs for an anthropologically themed game. Through iterative processes following the established HCI principle of 'design thinking', the prompts and the conceptual framework for crafting these games were refined. Leveraging GPT3.5, the study created three prototypes of games centered around the seminal anthropological work of the social anthropologist's Bronislaw Malinowski's "Argonauts of the Western Pacific" (1922). Subsequently, evaluations were conducted by inviting senior anthropologists to playtest these games, and based on their inputs, the game designs were refined. The tests revealed promising outcomes but also highlighted key challenges: the models encountered difficulties in providing in-depth thematic understandings, showed suspectibility to misinformation, tended towards monotonic responses after an extended period of play, and struggled to offer detailed biographical information. Despite these limitations, the study's findings open up new research avenues at the crossroads of artificial intelligence, machine learning, LLMs, ethnography, anthropology and human-computer interaction.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents for Strategic Production Policies in Microeconomic Market Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional economic models often rely on fixed assumptions about market dynamics, limiting their ability to capture the complexities and stochastic nature of real-world scenarios. However, reality is more complex and includes noise, making traditional models assumptions not met in the market. In this paper, we explore the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to obtain optimal production strategies in microeconomic market environments to overcome the limitations of traditional models. Concretely, we propose a DRL-based approach to obtain an effective policy in competitive markets with multiple producers, each optimizing their production decisions in response to fluctuating demand, supply, prices, subsidies, fixed costs, total production curve, elasticities and other effects contaminated by noise. Our framework enables agents to learn adaptive production policies to several simulations that consistently outperform static and random strategies. As the deep neural networks used by the agents are universal approximators of functions, DRL algorithms can represent in the network complex patterns of data learnt by trial and error that explain the market. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate how DRL can capture the intricate interplay between production costs, market prices, and competitor behavior, providing insights into optimal decision-making in dynamic economic settings. The results show that agents trained with DRL can strategically adjust production levels to maximize long-term profitability, even in the face of volatile market conditions. We believe that the study bridges the gap between theoretical economic modeling and practical market simulation, illustrating the potential of DRL to revolutionize decision-making in market strategies.</description>

      <title>SympCam: Remote Optical Measurement of Sympathetic Arousal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that a person's sympathetic arousal can be estimated from facial videos alone using basic signal processing. This opens up new possibilities in the field of telehealth and stress management, providing a non-invasive method to measure stress only using a regular RGB camera. In this paper, we present SympCam, a new 3D convolutional architecture tailored to the task of remote sympathetic arousal prediction. Our model incorporates a temporal attention module (TAM) to enhance the temporal coherence of our sequential data processing capabilities. The predictions from our method improve accuracy metrics of sympathetic arousal in prior work by 48% to a mean correlation of 0.77. We additionally compare our method with common remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) networks and show that they alone cannot accurately predict sympathetic arousal "out-of-the-box". Furthermore, we show that the sympathetic arousal predicted by our method allows detecting physical stress with a balanced accuracy of 90% - an improvement of 61% compared to the rPPG method commonly used in related work, demonstrating the limitations of using rPPG alone. Finally, we contribute a dataset designed explicitly for the task of remote sympathetic arousal prediction. Our dataset contains synchronized face and hand videos of 20 participants from two cameras synchronized with electrodermal activity (EDA) and photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements. We will make this dataset available to the community and use it to evaluate the methods in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset available to other researchers designed for remote sympathetic arousal prediction.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in automating code generation; however, their ability to generate accurate circuit-level SPICE code remains limited due to a lack of hardware-specific knowledge. In this paper, we analyze and identify the typical limitations of existing LLMs in SPICE code generation. To address these limitations, we present SPICEPilot a novel Python-based dataset generated using PySpice, along with its accompanying framework. This marks a significant step forward in automating SPICE code generation across various circuit configurations. Our framework automates the creation of SPICE simulation scripts, introduces standardized benchmarking metrics to evaluate LLM's ability for circuit generation, and outlines a roadmap for integrating LLMs into the hardware design process.

      <title>Unsupervised Panoptic Interpretation of Latent Spaces in GANs Using Space-Filling Vector Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) learn a latent space whose samples can be mapped to real-world images. Such latent spaces are difficult to interpret. Some earlier supervised methods aim to create an interpretable latent space or discover interpretable directions that require exploiting data labels or annotated synthesized samples for training. However, we propose using a modification of vector quantization called space-filling vector quantization (SFVQ), which quantizes the data on a piece-wise linear curve. SFVQ can capture the underlying morphological structure of the latent space and thus make it interpretable. We apply this technique to model the latent space of pretrained StyleGAN2 and BigGAN networks on various datasets. Our experiments show that the SFVQ curve yields a general interpretable model of the latent space that determines which part of the latent space corresponds to what specific generative factors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that each line of SFVQ's curve can potentially refer to an interpretable direction for applying intelligible image transformations. We also showed that the points located on an SFVQ line can be used for controllable data augmentation.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning Approaches for Improving Detection of Unseen Speech Deepfakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current speech deepfake detection approaches perform satisfactorily against known adversaries; however, generalization to unseen attacks remains an open challenge. The proliferation of speech deepfakes on social media underscores the need for systems that can generalize to unseen attacks not observed during training. We address this problem from the perspective of meta-learning, aiming to learn attack-invariant features to adapt to unseen attacks with very few samples available. This approach is promising since generating of a high-scale training dataset is often expensive or infeasible. Our experiments demonstrated an improvement in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 21.67% to 10.42% on the InTheWild dataset, using just 96 samples from the unseen dataset. Continuous few-shot adaptation ensures that the system remains up-to-date.</description>

      <title>Toward Conditional Distribution Calibration in Survival Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Survival prediction often involves estimating the time-to-event distribution from censored datasets. Previous approaches have focused on enhancing discrimination and marginal calibration. In this paper, we highlight the significance of conditional calibration for real-world applications -- especially its role in individual decision-making. We propose a method based on conformal prediction that uses the model's predicted individual survival probability at that instance's observed time. This method effectively improves the model's marginal and conditional calibration, without compromising discrimination. We provide asymptotic theoretical guarantees for both marginal and conditional calibration and test it extensively across 15 diverse real-world datasets, demonstrating the method's practical effectiveness and versatility in various settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce generator matching, a modality-agnostic framework for generative modeling using arbitrary Markov processes. Generators characterize the infinitesimal evolution of a Markov process, which we leverage for generative modeling in a similar vein to flow matching: we construct conditional generators which generate single data points, then learn to approximate the marginal generator which generates the full data distribution. We show that generator matching unifies various generative modeling methods, including diffusion models, flow matching and discrete diffusion models. Furthermore, it provides the foundation to expand the design space to new and unexplored Markov processes such as jump processes. Finally, generator matching enables the construction of superpositions of Markov generative processes and enables the construction of multimodal models in a rigorous manner. We empirically validate our method on protein and image structure generation, showing that superposition with a jump process improves image generation.</description>

      <title>LoRA Done RITE: Robust Invariant Transformation Equilibration for LoRA Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank adaption (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient finetuning method for LLM that reduces memory requirements. However, current LoRA optimizers lack transformation invariance, meaning the actual updates to the weights depends on how the two LoRA factors are scaled or rotated. This deficiency leads to inefficient learning and sub-optimal solutions in practice. This paper introduces LoRA-RITE, a novel adaptive matrix preconditioning method for LoRA optimization, which can achieve transformation invariance and remain computationally efficient. We provide theoretical analysis to demonstrate the benefit of our method and conduct experiments on various LLM tasks with different models including Gemma 2B, 7B, and mT5-XXL. The results demonstrate consistent improvements against existing optimizers. For example, replacing Adam with LoRA-RITE during LoRA fine-tuning of Gemma-2B yielded 4.6\% accuracy gain on Super-Natural Instructions and 3.5\% accuracy gain across other four LLM benchmarks (HellaSwag, ArcChallenge, GSM8K, OpenBookQA).</description>

      <title>Language Models And A Second Opinion Use Case: The Pocket Professional</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research tests the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) as formal second opinion tools in professional decision-making, particularly focusing on complex medical cases where even experienced physicians seek peer consultation. The work analyzed 183 challenging medical cases from Medscape over a 20-month period, testing multiple LLMs' performance against crowd-sourced physician responses. A key finding was the high overall score possible in the latest foundational models (&gt;80% accuracy compared to consensus opinion), which exceeds most human metrics reported on the same clinical cases (450 pages of patient profiles, test results). The study rates the LLMs' performance disparity between straightforward cases (&gt;81% accuracy) and complex scenarios (43% accuracy), particularly in these cases generating substantial debate among human physicians. The research demonstrates that LLMs may be valuable as generators of comprehensive differential diagnoses rather than as primary diagnostic tools, potentially helping to counter cognitive biases in clinical decision-making, reduce cognitive loads, and thus remove some sources of medical error. The inclusion of a second comparative legal dataset (Supreme Court cases, N=21) provides added empirical context to the AI use to foster second opinions, though these legal challenges proved considerably easier for LLMs to analyze. In addition to the original contributions of empirical evidence for LLM accuracy, the research aggregated a novel benchmark for others to score highly contested question and answer reliability between both LLMs and disagreeing human practitioners. These results suggest that the optimal deployment of LLMs in professional settings may differ substantially from current approaches that emphasize automation of routine tasks.</description>

      <title>NeuZip: Memory-Efficient Training and Inference with Dynamic Compression of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of neural networks improves when more parameters are used. However, the model sizes are constrained by the available on-device memory during training and inference. Although applying techniques like quantization can alleviate the constraint, they suffer from performance degradation. In this work, we introduce NeuZip, a new weight compression scheme based on the entropy of floating-point numbers in neural networks. With NeuZip, we are able to achieve memory-efficient training and inference without sacrificing performance. Notably, we significantly reduce the memory footprint of training a Llama-3 8B model from 31GB to less than 16GB, while keeping the training dynamics fully unchanged. In inference, our method can reduce memory usage by more than half while maintaining near-lossless performance. Our code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>SubjECTive-QA: Measuring Subjectivity in Earnings Call Transcripts' QA Through Six-Dimensional Feature Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fact-checking is extensively studied in the context of misinformation and disinformation, addressing objective inaccuracies. However, a softer form of misinformation involves responses that are factually correct but lack certain features such as clarity and relevance. This challenge is prevalent in formal Question-Answer (QA) settings such as press conferences in finance, politics, sports, and other domains, where subjective answers can obscure transparency. Despite this, there is a lack of manually annotated datasets for subjective features across multiple dimensions. To address this gap, we introduce SubjECTive-QA, a human annotated dataset on Earnings Call Transcripts' (ECTs) QA sessions as the answers given by company representatives are often open to subjective interpretations and scrutiny. The dataset includes 49,446 annotations for long-form QA pairs across six features: Assertive, Cautious, Optimistic, Specific, Clear, and Relevant. These features are carefully selected to encompass the key attributes that reflect the tone of the answers provided during QA sessions across different domain. Our findings are that the best-performing Pre-trained Language Model (PLM), RoBERTa-base, has similar weighted F1 scores to Llama-3-70b-Chat on features with lower subjectivity, such as Relevant and Clear, with a mean difference of 2.17% in their weighted F1 scores. The models perform significantly better on features with higher subjectivity, such as Specific and Assertive, with a mean difference of 10.01% in their weighted F1 scores. Furthermore, testing SubjECTive-QA's generalizability using QAs from White House Press Briefings and Gaggles yields an average weighted F1 score of 65.97% using our best models for each feature, demonstrating broader applicability beyond the financial domain.

      <title>A Statistical Analysis of Deep Federated Learning for Intrinsically Low-dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a groundbreaking paradigm in collaborative machine learning, emphasizing decentralized model training to address data privacy concerns. While significant progress has been made in optimizing federated learning, the exploration of generalization error, particularly in heterogeneous settings, has been limited, focusing mainly on parametric cases. This paper investigates the generalization properties of deep federated regression within a two-stage sampling model. Our findings highlight that the intrinsic dimension, defined by the entropic dimension, is crucial for determining convergence rates when appropriate network sizes are used. Specifically, if the true relationship between response and explanatory variables is charecterized by a $\beta$-H\"older function and there are $n$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples from $m$ participating clients, the error rate for participating clients scales at most as $\tilde{O}\left((mn)^{-2\beta/(2\beta + \bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda))}\right)$, and for non-participating clients, it scales as $\tilde{O}\left(\Delta \cdot m^{-2\beta/(2\beta + \bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda))} + (mn)^{-2\beta/(2\beta + \bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda))}\right)$. Here, $\bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda)$ represents the $2\beta$-entropic dimension of $\lambda$, the marginal distribution of the explanatory variables, and $\Delta$ characterizes the dependence between the sampling stages. Our results explicitly account for the "closeness" of clients, demonstrating that the convergence rates of deep federated learners depend on intrinsic rather than nominal high-dimensionality.</description>

      <title>TurboHopp: Accelerated Molecule Scaffold Hopping with Consistency Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigating the vast chemical space of druggable compounds is a formidable challenge in drug discovery, where generative models are increasingly employed to identify viable candidates. Conditional 3D structure-based drug design (3D-SBDD) models, which take into account complex three-dimensional interactions and molecular geometries, are particularly promising. Scaffold hopping is an efficient strategy that facilitates the identification of similar active compounds by strategically modifying the core structure of molecules, effectively narrowing the wide chemical space and enhancing the discovery of drug-like products. However, the practical application of 3D-SBDD generative models is hampered by their slow processing speeds. To address this bottleneck, we introduce TurboHopp, an accelerated pocket-conditioned 3D scaffold hopping model that merges the strategic effectiveness of traditional scaffold hopping with rapid generation capabilities of consistency models. This synergy not only enhances efficiency but also significantly boosts generation speeds, achieving up to 30 times faster inference speed as well as superior generation quality compared to existing diffusion-based models, establishing TurboHopp as a powerful tool in drug discovery. Supported by faster inference speed, we further optimize our model, using Reinforcement Learning for Consistency Models (RLCM), to output desirable molecules. We demonstrate the broad applicability of TurboHopp across multiple drug discovery scenarios, underscoring its potential in diverse molecular settings.</description>

      <title>Embedding with Large Language Models for Classification of HIPAA Safeguard Compliance Rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although software developers of mHealth apps are responsible for protecting patient data and adhering to strict privacy and security requirements, many of them lack awareness of HIPAA regulations and struggle to distinguish between HIPAA rules categories. Therefore, providing guidance of HIPAA rules patterns classification is essential for developing secured applications for Google Play Store. In this work, we identified the limitations of traditional Word2Vec embeddings in processing code patterns. To address this, we adopt multilingual BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) which offers contextualized embeddings to the attributes of dataset to overcome the issues. Therefore, we applied this BERT to our dataset for embedding code patterns and then uses these embedded code to various machine learning approaches. Our results demonstrate that the models significantly enhances classification performance, with Logistic Regression achieving a remarkable accuracy of 99.95\%. Additionally, we obtained high accuracy from Support Vector Machine (99.79\%), Random Forest (99.73\%), and Naive Bayes (95.93\%), outperforming existing approaches. This work underscores the effectiveness and showcases its potential for secure application development.</description>

      <title>Guide-LLM: An Embodied LLM Agent and Text-Based Topological Map for Robotic Guidance of People with Visual Impairments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigation presents a significant challenge for persons with visual impairments (PVI). While traditional aids such as white canes and guide dogs are invaluable, they fall short in delivering detailed spatial information and precise guidance to desired locations. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) offer new avenues for enhancing assistive navigation. In this paper, we introduce Guide-LLM, an embodied LLM-based agent designed to assist PVI in navigating large indoor environments. Our approach features a novel text-based topological map that enables the LLM to plan global paths using a simplified environmental representation, focusing on straight paths and right-angle turns to facilitate navigation. Additionally, we utilize the LLM's commonsense reasoning for hazard detection and personalized path planning based on user preferences. Simulated experiments demonstrate the system's efficacy in guiding PVI, underscoring its potential as a significant advancement in assistive technology. The results highlight Guide-LLM's ability to offer efficient, adaptive, and personalized navigation assistance, pointing to promising advancements in this field.</description>

      <title>Relation-based Counterfactual Data Augmentation and Contrastive Learning for Robustifying Natural Language Inference Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although pre-trained language models show good performance on various natural language processing tasks, they often rely on non-causal features and patterns to determine the outcome. For natural language inference tasks, previous results have shown that even a model trained on a large number of data fails to perform well on counterfactually revised data, indicating that the model is not robustly learning the semantics of the classes. In this paper, we propose a method in which we use token-based and sentence-based augmentation methods to generate counterfactual sentence pairs that belong to each class, and apply contrastive learning to help the model learn the difference between sentence pairs of different classes with similar contexts. Evaluation results with counterfactually-revised dataset and general NLI datasets show that the proposed method can improve the performance and robustness of the NLI model.</description>

      <title>Contextual Representation Anchor Network to Alleviate Selection Bias in Few-Shot Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the drug discovery process, the low success rate of drug candidate screening often leads to insufficient labeled data, causing the few-shot learning problem in molecular property prediction. Existing methods for few-shot molecular property prediction overlook the sample selection bias, which arises from non-random sample selection in chemical experiments. This bias in data representativeness leads to suboptimal performance. To overcome this challenge, we present a novel method named contextual representation anchor Network (CRA), where an anchor refers to a cluster center of the representations of molecules and serves as a bridge to transfer enriched contextual knowledge into molecular representations and enhance their expressiveness. CRA introduces a dual-augmentation mechanism that includes context augmentation, which dynamically retrieves analogous unlabeled molecules and captures their task-specific contextual knowledge to enhance the anchors, and anchor augmentation, which leverages the anchors to augment the molecular representations. We evaluate our approach on the MoleculeNet and FS-Mol benchmarks, as well as in domain transfer experiments. The results demonstrate that CRA outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.60% and 3.28% in AUC and $\Delta$AUC-PR metrics, respectively, and exhibits superior generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Lecture II: Communicative Justice and the Distribution of Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic intermediaries govern the digital public sphere through their architectures, amplification algorithms, and moderation practices. In doing so, they shape public communication and distribute attention in ways that were previously infeasible with such subtlety, speed and scale. From misinformation and affective polarisation to hate speech and radicalisation, the many pathologies of the digital public sphere attest that they could do so better. But what ideals should they aim at? Political philosophy should be able to help, but existing theories typically assume that a healthy public sphere will spontaneously emerge if only we get the boundaries of free expression right. They offer little guidance on how to intentionally constitute the digital public sphere. In addition to these theories focused on expression, we need a further theory of communicative justice, targeted specifically at the algorithmic intermediaries that shape communication and distribute attention. This lecture argues that political philosophy urgently owes an account of how to govern communication in the digital public sphere, and introduces and defends a democratic egalitarian theory of communicative justice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A century ago, John Dewey observed that '[s]team and electricity have done more to alter the conditions under which men associate together than all the agencies which affected human relationships before our time'. In the last few decades, computing technologies have had a similar effect. Political philosophy's central task is to help us decide how to live together, by analysing our social relations, diagnosing their failings, and articulating ideals to guide their revision. But these profound social changes have left scarcely a dent in the model of social relations that (analytical) political philosophers assume. This essay aims to reverse that trend. It first builds a model of our novel social relations as they are now, and as they are likely to evolved, and then explores how those differences affect our theories of how to live together. I introduce the 'Algorithmic City', the network of algorithmically-mediated social relations, then characterise the intermediary power by which it is governed. I show how algorithmic governance raises new challenges for political philosophy concerning the justification of authority, the foundations of procedural legitimacy, and the possibility of justificatory neutrality.</description>

Abstract: GPRec explicitly categorizes users into groups in a learnable manner and aligns them with corresponding group embeddings. We design the dual group embedding space to offer a diverse perspective on group preferences by contrasting positive and negative patterns. On the individual level, GPRec identifies personal preferences from ID-like features and refines the obtained individual representations to be independent of group ones, thereby providing a robust complement to the group-level modeling. We also present various strategies for the flexible integration of GPRec into various DRS models. Rigorous testing of GPRec on three public datasets has demonstrated significant improvements in recommendation quality.</description>

      <title>SEG:Seeds-Enhanced Iterative Refinement Graph Neural Network for Entity Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entity alignment is crucial for merging knowledge across knowledge graphs, as it matches entities with identical semantics. The standard method matches these entities based on their embedding similarities using semi-supervised learning. However, diverse data sources lead to non-isomorphic neighborhood structures for aligned entities, complicating alignment, especially for less common and sparsely connected entities. This paper presents a soft label propagation framework that integrates multi-source data and iterative seed enhancement, addressing scalability challenges in handling extensive datasets where scale computing excels. The framework uses seeds for anchoring and selects optimal relationship pairs to create soft labels rich in neighborhood features and semantic relationship data. A bidirectional weighted joint loss function is implemented, which reduces the distance between positive samples and differentially processes negative samples, taking into account the non-isomorphic neighborhood structures. Our method outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches, as evidenced by superior results on multiple datasets, significantly improving the quality of entity alignment.</description>

      <title>Murine AI excels at cats and cheese: Structural differences between human and mouse neurons and their implementation in generative AIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mouse and human brains have different functions that depend on their neuronal networks. In this study, we analyzed nanometer-scale three-dimensional structures of brain tissues of the mouse medial prefrontal cortex and compared them with structures of the human anterior cingulate cortex. The obtained results indicated that mouse neuronal somata are smaller and neurites are thinner than those of human neurons. These structural features allow mouse neurons to be integrated in the limited space of the brain, though thin neurites should suppress distal connections according to cable theory. We implemented this mouse-mimetic constraint in convolutional layers of a generative adversarial network (GAN) and a denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM), which were then subjected to image generation tasks using photo datasets of cat faces, cheese, human faces, and birds. The mouse-mimetic GAN outperformed a standard GAN in the image generation task using the cat faces and cheese photo datasets, but underperformed for human faces and birds. The mouse-mimetic DDIM gave similar results, suggesting that the nature of the datasets affected the results. Analyses of the four datasets indicated differences in their image entropy, which should influence the number of parameters required for image generation. The preferences of the mouse-mimetic AIs coincided with the impressions commonly associated with mice. The relationship between the neuronal network and brain function should be investigated by implementing other biological findings in artificial neural networks.</description>

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as a promising tool for assisting individuals in diverse text-generation tasks, including job-related texts. However, LLM-generated answers have been increasingly found to exhibit gender bias. This study evaluates three LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude) to conduct a multifaceted audit of LLM-generated interview responses across models, question types, and jobs, and their alignment with two gender stereotypes. Our findings reveal that gender bias is consistent, and closely aligned with gender stereotypes and the dominance of jobs. Overall, this study contributes to the systematic examination of gender bias in LLM-generated interview responses, highlighting the need for a mindful approach to mitigate such biases in related applications.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Unauthorized Speech Synthesis for Voice Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With just a few speech samples, it is possible to perfectly replicate a speaker's voice in recent years, while malicious voice exploitation (e.g., telecom fraud for illegal financial gain) has brought huge hazards in our daily lives. Therefore, it is crucial to protect publicly accessible speech data that contains sensitive information, such as personal voiceprints. Most previous defense methods have focused on spoofing speaker verification systems in timbre similarity but the synthesized deepfake speech is still of high quality. In response to the rising hazards, we devise an effective, transferable, and robust proactive protection technology named Pivotal Objective Perturbation (POP) that applies imperceptible error-minimizing noises on original speech samples to prevent them from being effectively learned for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis models so that high-quality deepfake speeches cannot be generated. We conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art (SOTA) TTS models utilizing objective and subjective metrics to comprehensively evaluate our proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate outstanding effectiveness and transferability across various models. Compared to the speech unclarity score of 21.94% from voice synthesizers trained on samples without protection, POP-protected samples significantly increase it to 127.31%. Moreover, our method shows robustness against noise reduction and data augmentation techniques, thereby greatly reducing potential hazards.</description>

      <title>Shopping MMLU: A Massive Multi-Task Online Shopping Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online shopping is a complex multi-task, few-shot learning problem with a wide and evolving range of entities, relations, and tasks. However, existing models and benchmarks are commonly tailored to specific tasks, falling short of capturing the full complexity of online shopping. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their multi-task and few-shot learning abilities, have the potential to profoundly transform online shopping by alleviating task-specific engineering efforts and by providing users with interactive conversations. Despite the potential, LLMs face unique challenges in online shopping, such as domain-specific concepts, implicit knowledge, and heterogeneous user behaviors. Motivated by the potential and challenges, we propose Shopping MMLU, a diverse multi-task online shopping benchmark derived from real-world Amazon data. Shopping MMLU consists of 57 tasks covering 4 major shopping skills: concept understanding, knowledge reasoning, user behavior alignment, and multi-linguality, and can thus comprehensively evaluate the abilities of LLMs as general shop assistants. With Shopping MMLU, we benchmark over 20 existing LLMs and uncover valuable insights about practices and prospects of building versatile LLM-based shop assistants. Shopping MMLU can be publicly accessed at https://github.com/KL4805/ShoppingMMLU. In addition, with Shopping MMLU, we host a competition in KDD Cup 2024 with over 500 participating teams. The winning solutions and the associated workshop can be accessed at our website https://amazon-kddcup24.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Matryoshka: Learning to Drive Black-Box LLMs with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the impressive generative abilities of black-box large language models (LLMs), their inherent opacity hinders further advancements in capabilities such as reasoning, planning, and personalization. Existing works aim to enhance LLM capabilities via domain-specific adaptation or in-context learning, which require additional training on accessible model parameters, an infeasible option for black-box LLMs. To address this challenge, we introduce Matryoshika, a lightweight white-box LLM controller that guides a large-scale black-box LLM generator by decomposing complex tasks into a series of intermediate outputs. Specifically, we consider the black-box LLM as an environment, with Matryoshika serving as a policy to provide intermediate guidance through prompts for driving the black-box LLM. Matryoshika is trained to pivot the outputs of the black-box LLM aligning with preferences during iterative interaction, which enables controllable multi-turn generation and self-improvement in optimizing intermediate guidance. Empirical evaluations on three diverse tasks demonstrate that Matryoshika effectively enhances the capabilities of black-box LLMs in complex, long-horizon tasks, including reasoning, planning, and personalization. By leveraging this pioneering controller-generator framework to mitigate dependence on model parameters, Matryoshika provides a transparent and practical solution for improving black-box LLMs through controllable multi-turn generation using white-box LLMs.</description>

      <title>ODRL: A Benchmark for Off-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider off-dynamics reinforcement learning (RL) where one needs to transfer policies across different domains with dynamics mismatch. Despite the focus on developing dynamics-aware algorithms, this field is hindered due to the lack of a standard benchmark. To bridge this gap, we introduce ODRL, the first benchmark tailored for evaluating off-dynamics RL methods. ODRL contains four experimental settings where the source and target domains can be either online or offline, and provides diverse tasks and a broad spectrum of dynamics shifts, making it a reliable platform to comprehensively evaluate the agent's adaptation ability to the target domain. Furthermore, ODRL includes recent off-dynamics RL algorithms in a unified framework and introduces some extra baselines for different settings, all implemented in a single-file manner. To unpack the true adaptation capability of existing methods, we conduct extensive benchmarking experiments, which show that no method has universal advantages across varied dynamics shifts. We hope this benchmark can serve as a cornerstone for future research endeavors. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/OffDynamicsRL/off-dynamics-rl.</description>

      <title>A Static and Dynamic Attention Framework for Multi Turn Dialogue Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, research on open domain dialogue systems have attracted extensive interests of academic and industrial researchers. The goal of an open domain dialogue system is to imitate humans in conversations. Previous works on single turn conversation generation have greatly promoted the research of open domain dialogue systems. However, understanding multiple single turn conversations is not equal to the understanding of multi turn dialogue due to the coherent and context dependent properties of human dialogue. Therefore, in open domain multi turn dialogue generation, it is essential to modeling the contextual semantics of the dialogue history, rather than only according to the last utterance. Previous research had verified the effectiveness of the hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder framework on open domain multi turn dialogue generation. However, using RNN-based model to hierarchically encoding the utterances to obtain the representation of dialogue history still face the problem of a vanishing gradient. To address this issue, in this paper, we proposed a static and dynamic attention-based approach to model the dialogue history and then generate open domain multi turn dialogue responses. Experimental results on Ubuntu and Opensubtitles datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed static and dynamic attention-based approach on automatic and human evaluation metrics in various experimental settings. Meanwhile, we also empirically verify the performance of combining the static and dynamic attentions on open domain multi turn dialogue generation.</description>

      <title>MrT5: Dynamic Token Merging for Efficient Byte-level Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models that rely on subword tokenization have significant drawbacks, such as sensitivity to character-level noise like spelling errors and inconsistent compression rates across different languages and scripts. While character- or byte-level models like ByT5 attempt to address these concerns, they have not gained widespread adoption -- processing raw byte streams without tokenization results in significantly longer sequence lengths, making training and inference inefficient. This work introduces MrT5 (MergeT5), a more efficient variant of ByT5 that integrates a token deletion mechanism in its encoder to dynamically shorten the input sequence length. After processing through a fixed number of encoder layers, a learnt delete gate determines which tokens are to be removed and which are to be retained for subsequent layers. MrT5 effectively ``merges'' critical information from deleted tokens into a more compact sequence, leveraging contextual information from the remaining tokens. In continued pre-training experiments, we find that MrT5 can achieve significant gains in inference runtime with minimal effect on performance. When trained on English text, MrT5 demonstrates the capability to transfer its deletion feature zero-shot across several languages, with significant additional improvements following multilingual training. Furthermore, MrT5 shows comparable accuracy to ByT5 on downstream evaluations such as XNLI and character-level tasks while reducing sequence lengths by up to 80%. Our approach presents a solution to the practical limitations of existing byte-level models.</description>

      <title>Introducing Spectral Attention for Long-Range Dependency in Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequence modeling faces challenges in capturing long-range dependencies across diverse tasks. Recent linear and transformer-based forecasters have shown superior performance in time series forecasting. However, they are constrained by their inherent inability to effectively address long-range dependencies in time series data, primarily due to using fixed-size inputs for prediction. Furthermore, they typically sacrifice essential temporal correlation among consecutive training samples by shuffling them into mini-batches. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a fast and effective Spectral Attention mechanism, which preserves temporal correlations among samples and facilitates the handling of long-range information while maintaining the base model structure. Spectral Attention preserves long-period trends through a low-pass filter and facilitates gradient to flow between samples. Spectral Attention can be seamlessly integrated into most sequence models, allowing models with fixed-sized look-back windows to capture long-range dependencies over thousands of steps. Through extensive experiments on 11 real-world time series datasets using 7 recent forecasting models, we consistently demonstrate the efficacy of our Spectral Attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>KD-LoRA: A Hybrid Approach to Efficient Fine-Tuning with LoRA and Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various downstream tasks. However, the high computational and memory requirements of LLMs are a major bottleneck. To address this, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have been proposed to reduce computational costs while ensuring minimal loss in performance. Additionally, knowledge distillation (KD) has been a popular choice for obtaining compact student models from teacher models. In this work, we present KD-LoRA, a novel fine-tuning method that combines LoRA with KD. Our results demonstrate that KD-LoRA achieves performance comparable to full fine-tuning (FFT) and LoRA while significantly reducing resource requirements. Specifically, KD-LoRA retains 98% of LoRA's performance on the GLUE benchmark, while being 40% more compact. Additionally, KD-LoRA reduces GPU memory usage by 30% compared to LoRA, while decreasing inference time by 30% compared to both FFT and LoRA. We evaluate KD-LoRA across three encoder-only models: BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTaV3. Code is available at https://github.com/rambodazimi/KD-LoRA.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Uncertainty Metrics for Long-form Language Model Outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved text generation capabilities, but these systems are still known to hallucinate, and granular uncertainty estimation for long-form LLM generations remains challenging. In this work, we propose Graph Uncertainty -- which represents the relationship between LLM generations and claims within them as a bipartite graph and estimates the claim-level uncertainty with a family of graph centrality metrics. Under this view, existing uncertainty estimation methods based on the concept of self-consistency can be viewed as using degree centrality as an uncertainty measure, and we show that more sophisticated alternatives such as closeness centrality provide consistent gains at claim-level uncertainty estimation. Moreover, we present uncertainty-aware decoding techniques that leverage both the graph structure and uncertainty estimates to improve the factuality of LLM generations by preserving only the most reliable claims. Compared to existing methods, our graph-based uncertainty metrics lead to an average of 6.8% relative gains on AUPRC across various long-form generation settings, and our end-to-end system provides consistent 2-4% gains in factuality over existing decoding techniques while significantly improving the informativeness of generated responses.</description>

      <title>From Cool Demos to Production-Ready FMware: Core Challenges and a Technology Roadmap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of foundation models (FMs), such as large language models (LLMs), has given rise to FMware--software systems that integrate FMs as core components. While building demonstration-level FMware is relatively straightforward, transitioning to production-ready systems presents numerous challenges, including reliability, high implementation costs, scalability, and compliance with privacy regulations. This paper provides a thematic analysis of the key obstacles in productionizing FMware, synthesized from industry experience and diverse data sources, including hands-on involvement in the Open Platform for Enterprise AI (OPEA) and FMware lifecycle engineering. We identify critical issues in FM selection, data and model alignment, prompt engineering, agent orchestration, system testing, and deployment, alongside cross-cutting concerns such as memory management, observability, and feedback integration. We discuss needed technologies and strategies to address these challenges and offer guidance on how to enable the transition from demonstration systems to scalable, production-ready FMware solutions. Our findings underscore the importance of continued research and multi-industry collaboration to advance the development of production-ready FMware.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap between Expert and Language Models: Concept-guided Chess Commentary Generation and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based expert models have reached superhuman performance in decision-making domains such as chess and Go. However, it is under-explored to explain or comment on given decisions although it is important for human education and model explainability. The outputs of expert models are accurate, but yet difficult to interpret for humans. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) produce fluent commentary but are prone to hallucinations due to their limited decision-making capabilities. To bridge this gap between expert models and LLMs, we focus on chess commentary as a representative case of explaining complex decision-making processes through language and address both the generation and evaluation of commentary. We introduce Concept-guided Chess Commentary generation (CCC) for producing commentary and GPT-based Chess Commentary Evaluation (GCC-Eval) for assessing it. CCC integrates the decision-making strengths of expert models with the linguistic fluency of LLMs through prioritized, concept-based explanations. GCC-Eval leverages expert knowledge to evaluate chess commentary based on informativeness and linguistic quality. Experimental results, validated by both human judges and GCC-Eval, demonstrate that CCC generates commentary that is accurate, informative, and fluent.</description>

      <title>ADLM -- stega: A Universal Adaptive Token Selection Algorithm for Improving Steganographic Text Quality via Information Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of widespread global information sharing, information security and privacy protection have become focal points. Steganographic systems enhance information security by embedding confidential information into public carriers; however, existing generative text steganography methods face challenges in handling the long-tail distribution of candidate word pools, which impacts the imperceptibility of steganographic information. This paper proposes a quality control theory for steganographic text generation based on information entropy constraints, exploring the relationship between the imperceptibility of steganographic texts and information entropy. By controlling the information entropy of the candidate word pool within a specific range, we optimize the imperceptibility of the steganographic text. We establish upper and lower bounds for information entropy and introduce an adaptive truncation method to balance semantic coherence and lexical diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that reasonably controlling the candidate pool size and information entropy thresholds significantly enhances the quality and detection resistance of steganographic texts, showcasing broad application potential in the field of natural language processing.</description>

Abstract: The solar magnetized corona is responsible for various manifestations with a space weather impact, such as flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and, naturally, the solar wind. Modeling the corona's dynamics and evolution is therefore critical for improving our ability to predict space weather In this work, we demonstrate that generative deep learning methods, such as Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), can be successfully applied to simulate future evolutions of the corona as observed in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths. Our model takes a 12-hour video of an Active Region (AR) as input and simulate the potential evolution of the AR over the subsequent 12 hours, with a time-resolution of two hours. We propose a light UNet backbone architecture adapted to our problem by adding 1D temporal convolutions after each classical 2D spatial ones, and spatio-temporal attention in the bottleneck part. The model not only produce visually realistic outputs but also captures the inherent stochasticity of the system's evolution. Notably, the simulations enable the generation of reliable confidence intervals for key predictive metrics such as the EUV peak flux and fluence of the ARs, paving the way for probabilistic and interpretable space weather forecasting. Future studies will focus on shorter forecasting horizons with increased spatial and temporal resolution, aiming at reducing the uncertainty of the simulations and providing practical applications for space weather forecasting.

      <title>Deep Insights into Automated Optimization with Large Language Models and Evolutionary Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing optimization approaches, whether heuristic or meta-heuristic, usually demands extensive manual intervention and has difficulty generalizing across diverse problem domains. The combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) offers a promising new approach to overcome these limitations and make optimization more automated. In this setup, LLMs act as dynamic agents that can generate, refine, and interpret optimization strategies, while EAs efficiently explore complex solution spaces through evolutionary operators. Since this synergy enables a more efficient and creative search process, we first conduct an extensive review of recent research on the application of LLMs in optimization. We focus on LLMs' dual functionality as solution generators and algorithm designers. Then, we summarize the common and valuable designs in existing work and propose a novel LLM-EA paradigm for automated optimization. Furthermore, centered on this paradigm, we conduct an in-depth analysis of innovative methods for three key components: individual representation, variation operators, and fitness evaluation. We address challenges related to heuristic generation and solution exploration, especially from the LLM prompts' perspective. Our systematic review and thorough analysis of the paradigm can assist researchers in better understanding the current research and promoting the development of combining LLMs with EAs for automated optimization.</description>

      <title>Strada-LLM: Graph LLM for traffic prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic prediction is a vital component of intelligent transportation systems. By reasoning about traffic patterns in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, accurate and interpretable predictions can be provided. A considerable challenge in traffic prediction lies in handling the diverse data distributions caused by vastly different traffic conditions occurring at different locations. LLMs have been a dominant solution due to their remarkable capacity to adapt to new datasets with very few labeled data samples, i.e., few-shot adaptability. However, existing forecasting techniques mainly focus on extracting local graph information and forming a text-like prompt, leaving LLM- based traffic prediction an open problem. This work presents a probabilistic LLM for traffic forecasting with three highlights. We propose a graph-aware LLM for traffic prediction that considers proximal traffic information. Specifically, by considering the traffic of neighboring nodes as covariates, our model outperforms the corresponding time-series LLM. Furthermore, we adopt a lightweight approach for efficient domain adaptation when facing new data distributions in few-shot fashion. The comparative experiment demonstrates the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based methods and the traditional GNN- based supervised approaches. Furthermore, Strada-LLM can be easily adapted to different LLM backbones without a noticeable performance drop.</description>

      <title>Diff-Instruct*: Towards Human-Preferred One-step Text-to-image Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Diff-Instruct*(DI*), a data-free approach for building one-step text-to-image generative models that align with human preference while maintaining the ability to generate highly realistic images. We frame human preference alignment as online reinforcement learning using human feedback (RLHF), where the goal is to maximize the reward function while regularizing the generator distribution to remain close to a reference diffusion process. Unlike traditional RLHF approaches, which rely on the KL divergence for regularization, we introduce a novel score-based divergence regularization, which leads to significantly better performances. Although the direct calculation of this divergence remains intractable, we demonstrate that we can efficiently compute its \emph{gradient} by deriving an equivalent yet tractable loss function. Remarkably, with Stable Diffusion V1.5 as the reference diffusion model, DI* outperforms \emph{all} previously leading models by a large margin. When using the 0.6B PixelArt-$\alpha$ model as the reference diffusion, DI* achieves a new record Aesthetic Score of 6.30 and an Image Reward of 1.31 with only a single generation step, almost doubling the scores of the rest of the models with similar sizes. It also achieves an HPSv2 score of 28.70, establishing a new state-of-the-art benchmark. We also observe that DI* can improve the layout and enrich the colors of generated images.</description>

      <title>Hacking Back the AI-Hacker: Prompt Injection as a Defense Against LLM-driven Cyberattacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being harnessed to automate cyberattacks, making sophisticated exploits more accessible and scalable. In response, we propose a new defense strategy tailored to counter LLM-driven cyberattacks. We introduce Mantis, a defensive framework that exploits LLMs' susceptibility to adversarial inputs to undermine malicious operations. Upon detecting an automated cyberattack, Mantis plants carefully crafted inputs into system responses, leading the attacker's LLM to disrupt their own operations (passive defense) or even compromise the attacker's machine (active defense). By deploying purposefully vulnerable decoy services to attract the attacker and using dynamic prompt injections for the attacker's LLM, Mantis can autonomously hack back the attacker. In our experiments, Mantis consistently achieved over 95% effectiveness against automated LLM-driven attacks. To foster further research and collaboration, Mantis is available as an open-source tool: https://github.com/pasquini-dario/project_mantis</description>

      <title>Instruction-Tuned LLMs Succeed in Document-Level MT Without Fine-Tuning -- But BLEU Turns a Blind Eye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have excelled in various NLP tasks, including machine translation (MT), yet most studies focus on sentence-level translation. This work investigates the inherent capability of instruction-tuned LLMs for document-level translation (docMT). Unlike prior approaches that require specialized techniques, we evaluate LLMs by directly prompting them to translate entire documents in a single pass. Our results show that this method improves translation quality compared to translating sentences separately, even without document-level fine-tuning. However, this advantage is not reflected in BLEU scores, which often favor sentence-based translations. We propose using the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm for evaluation, where GPT-4 is used to assess document coherence, accuracy, and fluency in a more nuanced way than n-gram-based metrics. Overall, our work demonstrates that instruction-tuned LLMs can effectively leverage document context for translation. However, we caution against using BLEU scores for evaluating docMT, as they often provide misleading outcomes, failing to capture the quality of document-level translation. Code and data are available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/BLEUless_DocMT</description>

      <title>DeTeCtive: Detecting AI-generated Text via Multi-Level Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current techniques for detecting AI-generated text are largely confined to manual feature crafting and supervised binary classification paradigms. These methodologies typically lead to performance bottlenecks and unsatisfactory generalizability. Consequently, these methods are often inapplicable for out-of-distribution (OOD) data and newly emerged large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we revisit the task of AI-generated text detection. We argue that the key to accomplishing this task lies in distinguishing writing styles of different authors, rather than simply classifying the text into human-written or AI-generated text. To this end, we propose DeTeCtive, a multi-task auxiliary, multi-level contrastive learning framework. DeTeCtive is designed to facilitate the learning of distinct writing styles, combined with a dense information retrieval pipeline for AI-generated text detection. Our method is compatible with a range of text encoders. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method enhances the ability of various text encoders in detecting AI-generated text across multiple benchmarks and achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, in OOD zero-shot evaluation, our method outperforms existing approaches by a large margin. Moreover, we find our method boasts a Training-Free Incremental Adaptation (TFIA) capability towards OOD data, further enhancing its efficacy in OOD detection scenarios. We will open-source our code and models in hopes that our work will spark new thoughts in the field of AI-generated text detection, ensuring safe application of LLMs and enhancing compliance. Our code is available at https://github.com/heyongxin233/DeTeCtive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lately, the continuous development of deep learning models by many researchers in the area of computer vision has attracted more researchers to further improve the accuracy of these models. FasterRCNN [32] has already provided a state-of-the-art approach to improve the accuracy and detection of 80 different objects given in the COCO dataset. To further improve the performance of person detection we have conducted a different approach which gives the state-of-the-art conclusion. An ROI is a step in FasterRCNN that extract the features from the given image with a fixed size and transfer into for further classification. To enhance the ROI performance, we have conducted an approach that implements dense pooling and converts the image into a 3D model to further transform into UV(ultra Violet) images which makes it easy to extract the right features from the images. To implement our approach we have approached the state-of-the-art COCO datasets and extracted 6982 images that include a person object and our final achievements conclude that using our approach has made significant results in detecting the person object in the given image</description>

      <title>BlueSuffix: Reinforced Blue Teaming for Vision-Language Models Against Jailbreak Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their superb multimodal capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which are inference-time attacks that induce the model to output harmful responses with tricky prompts. It is thus essential to defend VLMs against potential jailbreaks for their trustworthy deployment in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on black-box defense for VLMs against jailbreak attacks. Existing black-box defense methods are either unimodal or bimodal. Unimodal methods enhance either the vision or language module of the VLM, while bimodal methods robustify the model through text-image representation realignment. However, these methods suffer from two limitations: 1) they fail to fully exploit the cross-modal information, or 2) they degrade the model performance on benign inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel blue-team method BlueSuffix that defends the black-box target VLM against jailbreak attacks without compromising its performance. BlueSuffix includes three key components: 1) a visual purifier against jailbreak images, 2) a textual purifier against jailbreak texts, and 3) a blue-team suffix generator fine-tuned via reinforcement learning for enhancing cross-modal robustness. We empirically show on three VLMs (LLaVA, MiniGPT-4, and Gemini) and two safety benchmarks (MM-SafetyBench and RedTeam-2K) that BlueSuffix outperforms the baseline defenses by a significant margin. Our BlueSuffix opens up a promising direction for defending VLMs against jailbreak attacks.</description>

      <title>Geo-FuB: A Method for Constructing an Operator-Function Knowledge Base for Geospatial Code Generation Tasks Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of spatiotemporal data and the need for efficient geospatial modeling have spurred interest in automating these tasks with large language models (LLMs). However, general LLMs often generate errors in geospatial code due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge on functions and operators. To address this, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach, utilizing an external knowledge base of geospatial functions and operators, is proposed. This study introduces a framework to construct such a knowledge base, leveraging geospatial script semantics. The framework includes: Function Semantic Framework Construction (Geo-FuSE), Frequent Operator Combination Statistics (Geo-FuST), and Semantic Mapping (Geo-FuM). Techniques like Chain-of-Thought, TF-IDF, and the APRIORI algorithm are utilized to derive and align geospatial functions. An example knowledge base, Geo-FuB, built from 154,075 Google Earth Engine scripts, is available on GitHub. Evaluation metrics show a high accuracy, reaching 88.89% overall, with structural and semantic accuracies of 92.03% and 86.79% respectively. Geo-FuB's potential to optimize geospatial code generation through the RAG and fine-tuning paradigms is highlighted.</description>

      <title>EEG-Driven 3D Object Reconstruction with Color Consistency and Diffusion Prior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: EEG-based visual perception reconstruction has become a current research hotspot. Neuroscientific studies have shown that humans can perceive various types of visual information, such as color, shape, and texture, when observing objects. However, existing technical methods often face issues such as inconsistencies in texture, shape, and color between the visual stimulus images and the reconstructed images. In this paper, we propose a method for reconstructing 3D objects with color consistency based on EEG signals. The method adopts a two-stage strategy: in the first stage, we train an implicit neural EEG encoder with the capability of perceiving 3D objects, enabling it to capture regional semantic features; in the second stage, based on the latent EEG codes obtained in the first stage, we integrate a diffusion model, neural style loss, and NeRF to implicitly decode the 3D objects. Finally, through experimental validation, we demonstrate that our method can reconstruct 3D objects with color consistency using EEG.</description>

      <title>Efficient Bilinear Attention-based Fusion for Medical Visual Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) has gained increasing attention at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. Its capability to interpret radiological images and deliver precise answers to clinical inquiries positions MedVQA as a valuable tool for supporting diagnostic decision-making for physicians and alleviating the workload on radiologists. While recent approaches focus on using unified pre-trained large models for multi-modal fusion like cross-modal Transformers, research on more efficient fusion methods remains relatively scarce within this discipline. In this paper, we introduce a novel fusion model that integrates Orthogonality loss, Multi-head attention and Bilinear Attention Network (OMniBAN) to achieve high computational efficiency and strong performance without the need for pre-training. We conduct comprehensive experiments and clarify aspects of how to enhance bilinear attention fusion to achieve performance comparable to that of large models. Experimental results show that OMniBAN outperforms traditional models on key MedVQA benchmarks while maintaining a lower computational cost, which indicates its potential for efficient clinical application in radiology and pathology image question answering.</description>

      <title>FACT: Examining the Effectiveness of Iterative Context Rewriting for Multi-fact Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are proficient at retrieving single facts from extended contexts, yet they struggle with tasks requiring the simultaneous retrieval of multiple facts, especially during generation. This paper identifies a novel "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon, where LLMs progressively lose track of critical information throughout the generation process, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate retrieval. To address this challenge, we introduce Find All Crucial Texts (FACT), an iterative retrieval method that refines context through successive rounds of rewriting. This approach enables models to capture essential facts incrementally, which are often overlooked in single-pass retrieval. Experiments demonstrate that FACT substantially enhances multi-fact retrieval performance across various tasks, though improvements are less notable in general-purpose QA scenarios. Our findings shed light on the limitations of LLMs in multi-fact retrieval and underscore the need for more resilient long-context retrieval strategies.</description>

      <title>Informed Deep Abstaining Classifier: Investigating noise-robust training for diagnostic decision support systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image-based diagnostic decision support systems (DDSS) utilizing deep learning have the potential to optimize clinical workflows. However, developing DDSS requires extensive datasets with expert annotations and is therefore costly. Leveraging report contents from radiological data bases with Natural Language Processing to annotate the corresponding image data promises to replace labor-intensive manual annotation. As mining "real world" databases can introduce label noise, noise-robust training losses are of great interest. However, current noise-robust losses do not consider noise estimations that can for example be derived based on the performance of the automatic label generator used. In this study, we expand the noise-robust Deep Abstaining Classifier (DAC) loss to an Informed Deep Abstaining Classifier (IDAC) loss by incorporating noise level estimations during training. Our findings demonstrate that IDAC enhances the noise robustness compared to DAC and several state-of-the-art loss functions. The results are obtained on various simulated noise levels using a public chest X-ray data set. These findings are reproduced on an in-house noisy data set, where labels were extracted from the clinical systems of the University Hospital Bonn by a text-based transformer. The IDAC can therefore be a valuable tool for researchers, companies or clinics aiming to develop accurate and reliable DDSS from routine clinical data.</description>

Abstract: This research is focused on traffic congestion in the small island of Malta which is the most densely populated country in the EU with about 1,672 inhabitants per square kilometre (4,331 inhabitants/sq mi). Furthermore, Malta has a rapid vehicle growth. Based on our research, the number of vehicles increased by around 11,000 in a little more than 6 months, which shows how important it is to have an accurate and comprehensive means of collecting data to tackle the issue of fluctuating traffic in Malta. In this paper, we first present the newly built comprehensive traffic dataset, called MalTra. This dataset includes realistic trips made by members of the public across the island over a period of 200 days. We then describe the methodology we adopted to generate syntactic data to complete our data set as much as possible. In our research, we consider both MalTra and the Q-Traffic dataset, which has been used in several other research studies. The statistical ARIMA model and two graph neural networks, the spatial temporal graph convolutional network (STGCN) and the diffusion convolutional recurrent network (DCRNN) were used to analyse and compare the results with existing research. From the evaluation, we found that the DCRNN model outperforms the STGCN with the former resulting in MAE of 3.98 (6.65 in the case of the latter) and a RMSE of 7.78 (against 12.73 of the latter).</description>

      <title>FairStream: Fair Multimedia Streaming Benchmark for Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>

Abstract: Multimedia streaming accounts for the majority of traffic in today's internet. Mechanisms like adaptive bitrate streaming control the bitrate of a stream based on the estimated bandwidth, ideally resulting in smooth playback and a good Quality of Experience (QoE). However, selecting the optimal bitrate is challenging under volatile network conditions. This motivated researchers to train Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents for multimedia streaming. The considered training environments are often simplified, leading to promising results with limited applicability. Additionally, the QoE fairness across multiple streams is seldom considered by recent RL approaches. With this work, we propose a novel multi-agent environment that comprises multiple challenges of fair multimedia streaming: partial observability, multiple objectives, agent heterogeneity and asynchronicity. We provide and analyze baseline approaches across five different traffic classes to gain detailed insights into the behavior of the considered agents, and show that the commonly used Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is outperformed by a simple greedy heuristic. Future work includes the adaptation of multi-agent RL algorithms and further expansions of the environment.</description>

      <title>Disentangled and Self-Explainable Node Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Node representations, or embeddings, are low-dimensional vectors that capture node properties, typically learned through unsupervised structural similarity objectives or supervised tasks. While recent efforts have focused on explaining graph model decisions, the interpretability of unsupervised node embeddings remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce DiSeNE (Disentangled and Self-Explainable Node Embedding), a framework that generates self-explainable embeddings in an unsupervised manner. Our method employs disentangled representation learning to produce dimension-wise interpretable embeddings, where each dimension is aligned with distinct topological structure of the graph. We formalize novel desiderata for disentangled and interpretable embeddings, which drive our new objective functions, optimizing simultaneously for both interpretability and disentanglement. Additionally, we propose several new metrics to evaluate representation quality and human interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Getting By Goal Misgeneralization With a Little Help From a Mentor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) agents often perform well during training, they can struggle with distribution shift in real-world deployments. One particularly severe risk of distribution shift is goal misgeneralization, where the agent learns a proxy goal that coincides with the true goal during training but not during deployment. In this paper, we explore whether allowing an agent to ask for help from a supervisor in unfamiliar situations can mitigate this issue. We focus on agents trained with PPO in the CoinRun environment, a setting known to exhibit goal misgeneralization. We evaluate multiple methods for determining when the agent should request help and find that asking for help consistently improves performance. However, we also find that methods based on the agent's internal state fail to proactively request help, instead waiting until mistakes have already occurred. Further investigation suggests that the agent's internal state does not represent the coin at all, highlighting the importance of learning nuanced representations, the risks of ignoring everything not immediately relevant to reward, and the necessity of developing ask-for-help strategies tailored to the agent's training algorithm.</description>

      <title>CTINEXUS: Leveraging Optimized LLM In-Context Learning for Constructing Cybersecurity Knowledge Graphs Under Data Scarcity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Textual descriptions in cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports, such as security articles and news, are rich sources of knowledge about cyber threats, crucial for organizations to stay informed about the rapidly evolving threat landscape. However, current CTI extraction methods lack flexibility and generalizability, often resulting in inaccurate and incomplete knowledge extraction. Syntax parsing relies on fixed rules and dictionaries, while model fine-tuning requires large annotated datasets, making both paradigms challenging to adapt to new threats and ontologies. To bridge the gap, we propose CTINexus, a novel framework leveraging optimized in-context learning (ICL) of large language models (LLMs) for data-efficient CTI knowledge extraction and high-quality cybersecurity knowledge graph (CSKG) construction. Unlike existing methods, CTINexus requires neither extensive data nor parameter tuning and can adapt to various ontologies with minimal annotated examples. This is achieved through (1) a carefully designed automatic prompt construction strategy with optimal demonstration retrieval for extracting a wide range of cybersecurity entities and relations; (2) a hierarchical entity alignment technique that canonicalizes the extracted knowledge and removes redundancy; (3) an ICL-enhanced long-distance relation prediction technique to further complete the CKSG with missing links. Our extensive evaluations using 150 real-world CTI reports collected from 10 platforms demonstrate that CTINexus significantly outperforms existing methods in constructing accurate and complete CSKGs, highlighting its potential to transform CTI analysis with an efficient and adaptable solution for the dynamic threat landscape.</description>

      <title>Kandinsky 3: Text-to-Image Synthesis for Multifunctional Generative Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models are popular for introducing image manipulation methods, such as editing, image fusion, inpainting, etc. At the same time, image-to-video (I2V) and text-to-video (T2V) models are also built on top of T2I models. We present Kandinsky 3, a novel T2I model based on latent diffusion, achieving a high level of quality and photorealism. The key feature of the new architecture is the simplicity and efficiency of its adaptation for many types of generation tasks. We extend the base T2I model for various applications and create a multifunctional generation system that includes text-guided inpainting/outpainting, image fusion, text-image fusion, image variations generation, I2V and T2V generation. We also present a distilled version of the T2I model, evaluating inference in 4 steps of the reverse process without reducing image quality and 3 times faster than the base model. We deployed a user-friendly demo system in which all the features can be tested in the public domain. Additionally, we released the source code and checkpoints for the Kandinsky 3 and extended models. Human evaluations show that Kandinsky 3 demonstrates one of the highest quality scores among open source generation systems.</description>

      <title>EMOCPD: Efficient Attention-based Models for Computational Protein Design Using Amino Acid Microenvironment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational protein design (CPD) refers to the use of computational methods to design proteins. Traditional methods relying on energy functions and heuristic algorithms for sequence design are inefficient and do not meet the demands of the big data era in biomolecules, with their accuracy limited by the energy functions and search algorithms. Existing deep learning methods are constrained by the learning capabilities of the networks, failing to extract effective information from sparse protein structures, which limits the accuracy of protein design. To address these shortcomings, we developed an Efficient attention-based Models for Computational Protein Design using amino acid microenvironment (EMOCPD). It aims to predict the category of each amino acid in a protein by analyzing the three-dimensional atomic environment surrounding the amino acids, and optimize the protein based on the predicted high-probability potential amino acid categories. EMOCPD employs a multi-head attention mechanism to focus on important features in the sparse protein microenvironment and utilizes an inverse residual structure to optimize the network architecture. The proposed EMOCPD achieves over 80% accuracy on the training set and 68.33% and 62.32% accuracy on two independent test sets, respectively, surpassing the best comparative methods by over 10%. In protein design, the thermal stability and protein expression of the predicted mutants from EMOCPD show significant improvements compared to the wild type, effectively validating EMOCPD's potential in designing superior proteins. Furthermore, the predictions of EMOCPD are influenced positively, negatively, or have minimal impact based on the content of the 20 amino acids, categorizing amino acids as positive, negative, or neutral. Research findings indicate that EMOCPD is more suitable for designing proteins with lower contents of negative amino acids.</description>

      <title>Skip2-LoRA: A Lightweight On-device DNN Fine-tuning Method for Low-cost Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes Skip2-LoRA as a lightweight fine-tuning method for deep neural networks to address the gap between pre-trained and deployed models. In our approach, trainable LoRA (low-rank adaptation) adapters are inserted between the last layer and every other layer to enhance the network expressive power while keeping the backward computation cost low. This architecture is well-suited to cache intermediate computation results of the forward pass and then can skip the forward computation of seen samples as training epochs progress. We implemented the combination of the proposed architecture and cache, denoted as Skip2-LoRA, and tested it on a $15 single board computer. Our results show that Skip2-LoRA reduces the fine-tuning time by 90.0% on average compared to the counterpart that has the same number of trainable parameters while preserving the accuracy, while taking only a few seconds on the microcontroller board.</description>

      <title>Stealthy Jailbreak Attacks on Large Language Models via Benign Data Mirroring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) safety is a critical issue, with numerous studies employing red team testing to enhance model security. Among these, jailbreak methods explore potential vulnerabilities by crafting malicious prompts that induce model outputs contrary to safety alignments. Existing black-box jailbreak methods often rely on model feedback, repeatedly submitting queries with detectable malicious instructions during the attack search process. Although these approaches are effective, the attacks may be intercepted by content moderators during the search process. We propose an improved transfer attack method that guides malicious prompt construction by locally training a mirror model of the target black-box model through benign data distillation. This method offers enhanced stealth, as it does not involve submitting identifiable malicious instructions to the target model during the search phase. Our approach achieved a maximum attack success rate of 92%, or a balanced value of 80% with an average of 1.5 detectable jailbreak queries per sample against GPT-3.5 Turbo on a subset of AdvBench. These results underscore the need for more robust defense mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Efficient Mixture-of-Expert for Video-based Driver State and Physiological Multi-task Estimation in Conditional Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Road safety remains a critical challenge worldwide, with approximately 1.35 million fatalities annually attributed to traffic accidents, often due to human errors. As we advance towards higher levels of vehicle automation, challenges still exist, as driving with automation can cognitively over-demand drivers if they engage in non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs), or lead to drowsiness if driving was the sole task. This calls for the urgent need for an effective Driver Monitoring System (DMS) that can evaluate cognitive load and drowsiness in SAE Level-2/3 autonomous driving contexts. In this study, we propose a novel multi-task DMS, termed VDMoE, which leverages RGB video input to monitor driver states non-invasively. By utilizing key facial features to minimize computational load and integrating remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) for physiological insights, our approach enhances detection accuracy while maintaining efficiency. Additionally, we optimize the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework to accommodate multi-modal inputs and improve performance across different tasks. A novel prior-inclusive regularization method is introduced to align model outputs with statistical priors, thus accelerating convergence and mitigating overfitting risks. We validate our method with the creation of a new dataset (MCDD), which comprises RGB video and physiological indicators from 42 participants, and two public datasets. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of VDMoE in monitoring driver states, contributing to safer autonomous driving systems. The code and data will be released.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selection of occluded objects is a challenging problem in virtual reality, even more so if multiple objects are involved. With the advent of new artificial intelligence technologies, we explore the possibility of leveraging large language models to assist multi-object selection tasks in virtual reality via a multimodal speech and raycast interaction technique. We validate the findings in a comparative user study (n=24), where participants selected target objects in a virtual reality scene with different levels of scene perplexity. The performance metrics and user experience metrics are compared against a mini-map based occluded object selection technique that serves as the baseline. Results indicate that the introduced technique, AssistVR, outperforms the baseline technique when there are multiple target objects. Contrary to the common belief for speech interfaces, AssistVR was able to outperform the baseline even when the target objects were difficult to reference verbally. This work demonstrates the viability and interaction potential of an intelligent multimodal interactive system powered by large laguage models. Based on the results, we discuss the implications for design of future intelligent multimodal interactive systems in immersive environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enzyme engineering enables the modification of wild-type proteins to meet industrial and research demands by enhancing catalytic activity, stability, binding affinities, and other properties. The emergence of deep learning methods for protein modeling has demonstrated superior results at lower costs compared to traditional approaches such as directed evolution and rational design. In mutation effect prediction, the key to pre-training deep learning models lies in accurately interpreting the complex relationships among protein sequence, structure, and function. This study introduces a retrieval-enhanced protein language model for comprehensive analysis of native properties from sequence and local structural interactions, as well as evolutionary properties from retrieved homologous sequences. The state-of-the-art performance of the proposed ProtREM is validated on over 2 million mutants across 217 assays from an open benchmark (ProteinGym). We also conducted post-hoc analyses of the model's ability to improve the stability and binding affinity of a VHH antibody. Additionally, we designed 10 new mutants on a DNA polymerase and conducted wet-lab experiments to evaluate their enhanced activity at higher temperatures. Both in silico and experimental evaluations confirmed that our method provides reliable predictions of mutation effects, offering an auxiliary tool for biologists aiming to evolve existing enzymes. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/tyang816/ProtREM.</description>

      <title>Fast Calibrated Explanations: Efficient and Uncertainty-Aware Explanations for Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Fast Calibrated Explanations, a method designed for generating rapid, uncertainty-aware explanations for machine learning models. By incorporating perturbation techniques from ConformaSight - a global explanation framework - into the core elements of Calibrated Explanations (CE), we achieve significant speedups. These core elements include local feature importance with calibrated predictions, both of which retain uncertainty quantification. While the new method sacrifices a small degree of detail, it excels in computational efficiency, making it ideal for high-stakes, real-time applications. Fast Calibrated Explanations are applicable to probabilistic explanations in classification and thresholded regression tasks, where they provide the likelihood of a target being above or below a user-defined threshold. This approach maintains the versatility of CE for both classification and probabilistic regression, making it suitable for a range of predictive tasks where uncertainty quantification is crucial.</description>

      <title>Palisade -- Prompt Injection Detection Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models LLMs marks a milestone in Artificial Intelligence, altering how machines comprehend and generate human language. However, LLMs are vulnerable to malicious prompt injection attacks, where crafted inputs manipulate the models behavior in unintended ways, compromising system integrity and causing incorrect outcomes. Conventional detection methods rely on static, rule-based approaches, which often fail against sophisticated threats like abnormal token sequences and alias substitutions, leading to limited adaptability and higher rates of false positives and false negatives.This paper proposes a novel NLP based approach for prompt injection detection, emphasizing accuracy and optimization through a layered input screening process. In this framework, prompts are filtered through three distinct layers rule-based, ML classifier, and companion LLM before reaching the target model, thereby minimizing the risk of malicious interaction.Tests show the ML classifier achieves the highest accuracy among individual layers, yet the multi-layer framework enhances overall detection accuracy by reducing false negatives. Although this increases false positives, it minimizes the risk of overlooking genuine injected prompts, thus prioritizing security.This multi-layered detection approach highlights LLM vulnerabilities and provides a comprehensive framework for future research, promoting secure interactions between humans and AI systems.</description>

Abstract: Modeling stochastic and irregularly sampled time series is a challenging problem found in a wide range of applications, especially in medicine. Neural stochastic differential equations (Neural SDEs) are an attractive modeling technique for this problem, which parameterize the drift and diffusion terms of an SDE with neural networks. However, current algorithms for training Neural SDEs require backpropagation through the SDE dynamics, greatly limiting their scalability and stability. To address this, we propose Trajectory Flow Matching (TFM), which trains a Neural SDE in a simulation-free manner, bypassing backpropagation through the dynamics. TFM leverages the flow matching technique from generative modeling to model time series. In this work we first establish necessary conditions for TFM to learn time series data. Next, we present a reparameterization trick which improves training stability. Finally, we adapt TFM to the clinical time series setting, demonstrating improved performance on three clinical time series datasets both in terms of absolute performance and uncertainty prediction.</description>

      <title>CURATe: Benchmarking Personalised Alignment of Conversational AI Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a multi-turn benchmark for evaluating personalised alignment in LLM-based AI assistants, focusing on their ability to handle user-provided safety-critical contexts. Our assessment of ten leading models across five scenarios (each with 337 use cases) reveals systematic inconsistencies in maintaining user-specific consideration, with even top-rated "harmless" models making recommendations that should be recognised as obviously harmful to the user given the context provided. Key failure modes include inappropriate weighing of conflicting preferences, sycophancy (prioritising user preferences above safety), a lack of attentiveness to critical user information within the context window, and inconsistent application of user-specific knowledge. The same systematic biases were observed in OpenAI's o1, suggesting that strong reasoning capacities do not necessarily transfer to this kind of personalised thinking. We find that prompting LLMs to consider safety-critical context significantly improves performance, unlike a generic 'harmless and helpful' instruction. Based on these findings, we propose research directions for embedding self-reflection capabilities, online user modelling, and dynamic risk assessment in AI assistants. Our work emphasises the need for nuanced, context-aware approaches to alignment in systems designed for persistent human interaction, aiding the development of safe and considerate AI assistants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Document parsing is essential for converting unstructured and semi-structured documents-such as contracts, academic papers, and invoices-into structured, machine-readable data. Document parsing extract reliable structured data from unstructured inputs, providing huge convenience for numerous applications. Especially with recent achievements in Large Language Models, document parsing plays an indispensable role in both knowledge base construction and training data generation. This survey presents a comprehensive review of the current state of document parsing, covering key methodologies, from modular pipeline systems to end-to-end models driven by large vision-language models. Core components such as layout detection, content extraction (including text, tables, and mathematical expressions), and multi-modal data integration are examined in detail. Additionally, this paper discusses the challenges faced by modular document parsing systems and vision-language models in handling complex layouts, integrating multiple modules, and recognizing high-density text. It emphasizes the importance of developing larger and more diverse datasets and outlines future research directions.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Fatigue Cracks Detection in Bridge Girders using Feature Pyramid Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For structural health monitoring, continuous and automatic crack detection has been a challenging problem. This study is conducted to propose a framework of automatic crack segmentation from high-resolution images containing crack information about steel box girders of bridges. Considering the multi-scale feature of cracks, convolutional neural network architecture of Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) for crack detection is proposed. As for input, 120 raw images are processed via two approaches (shrinking the size of images and splitting images into sub-images). Then, models with the proposed structure of FPN for crack detection are developed. The result shows all developed models can automatically detect the cracks at the raw images. By shrinking the images, the computation efficiency is improved without decreasing accuracy. Because of the separable characteristic of crack, models using the splitting method provide more accurate crack segmentations than models using the resizing method. Therefore, for high-resolution images, the FPN structure coupled with the splitting method is an promising solution for the crack segmentation and detection.</description>

      <title>Belief in the Machine: Investigating Epistemological Blind Spots of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As language models (LMs) become integral to fields like healthcare, law, and journalism, their ability to differentiate between fact, belief, and knowledge is essential for reliable decision-making. Failure to grasp these distinctions can lead to significant consequences in areas such as medical diagnosis, legal judgments, and dissemination of fake news. Despite this, current literature has largely focused on more complex issues such as theory of mind, overlooking more fundamental epistemic challenges. This study systematically evaluates the epistemic reasoning capabilities of modern LMs, including GPT-4, Claude-3, and Llama-3, using a new dataset, KaBLE, consisting of 13,000 questions across 13 tasks. Our results reveal key limitations. First, while LMs achieve 86% accuracy on factual scenarios, their performance drops significantly with false scenarios, particularly in belief-related tasks. Second, LMs struggle with recognizing and affirming personal beliefs, especially when those beliefs contradict factual data, which raises concerns for applications in healthcare and counseling, where engaging with a person's beliefs is critical. Third, we identify a salient bias in how LMs process first-person versus third-person beliefs, performing better on third-person tasks (80.7%) compared to first-person tasks (54.4%). Fourth, LMs lack a robust understanding of the factive nature of knowledge, namely, that knowledge inherently requires truth. Fifth, LMs rely on linguistic cues for fact-checking and sometimes bypass the deeper reasoning. These findings highlight significant concerns about current LMs' ability to reason about truth, belief, and knowledge while emphasizing the need for advancements in these areas before broad deployment in critical sectors.</description>

      <title>BongLLaMA: LLaMA for Bangla Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bangla (or "Bengali") is a language spoken by approximately 240 million native speakers and around 300 million people worldwide. Despite being the 5th largest spoken language in the world, Bangla is still a "low-resource" language, and existing pretrained language models often struggle to perform well on Bangla Language Processing (BLP) tasks. This work addresses this gap by introducing BongLLaMA (i.e., Bangla-LLaMA), an open-source large language model fine-tuned exclusively on large Bangla corpora and instruction-tuning datasets. We present our methodology, data augmentation techniques, fine-tuning details, and comprehensive benchmarking results showcasing the utility of BongLLaMA on BLP tasks. We believe BongLLaMA will serve as the new standard baseline for Bangla Language Models and, thus, facilitate future benchmarking studies focused on this widely-spoken yet "low-resource" language. All BongLLaMA models are available for public use at https://huggingface.co/BanglaLLM.</description>

      <title>SeriesGAN: Time Series Generation via Adversarial and Autoregressive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based approaches for time series generation face challenges such as suboptimal convergence, information loss in embedding spaces, and instability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an advanced framework that integrates the advantages of an autoencoder-generated embedding space with the adversarial training dynamics of GANs. This method employs two discriminators: one to specifically guide the generator and another to refine both the autoencoder's and generator's output. Additionally, our framework incorporates a novel autoencoder-based loss function and supervision from a teacher-forcing supervisor network, which captures the stepwise conditional distributions of the data. The generator operates within the latent space, while the two discriminators work on latent and feature spaces separately, providing crucial feedback to both the generator and the autoencoder. By leveraging this dual-discriminator approach, we minimize information loss in the embedding space. Through joint training, our framework excels at generating high-fidelity time series data, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art benchmarks both qualitatively and quantitatively across a range of real and synthetic multivariate time series datasets.</description>

      <title>HoPE: A Novel Positional Encoding Without Long-Term Decay for Enhanced Context Awareness and Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many positional encodings (PEs) are designed to exhibit long-term decay, based on an entrenched and long-standing inductive opinion: tokens farther away from the current position carry less relevant information. We argue that long-term decay is outdated in the era of LLMs, as LLMs are now applied to tasks demanding precise retrieval of in-context information from arbitrary positions. Firstly, we present empirical analyses on various PEs, demonstrating that models inherently learn attention with only a local-decay pattern while forming a U-shape pattern globally, contradicting the principle of long-term decay. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of rotary position encoding (RoPE, a prevalent relative positional encoding in LLMs), and found that the U-shape attention is caused by some learned components, which are also the key factor limiting RoPE's expressiveness and extrapolation.Inspired by these insights, we propose High-frequency rotary Position Encoding (HoPE). HoPE replaces the specific components in RoPE with position-independent ones, retaining only high-frequency signals, which also breaks the principle of long-term decay in theory. HoPE achieves two major advantages: (1) Without constraints imposed by long-term decay, contradictory factors that limit spontaneous attention optimization and model extrapolation performance are removed. (2) Components representing positions and semantics are are optimized. These enhances model's context awareness and extrapolation, as validated by extensive experiments.</description>

      <title>Vision Search Assistant: Empower Vision-Language Models as Multimodal Search Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Search engines enable the retrieval of unknown information with texts. However, traditional methods fall short when it comes to understanding unfamiliar visual content, such as identifying an object that the model has never seen before. This challenge is particularly pronounced for large vision-language models (VLMs): if the model has not been exposed to the object depicted in an image, it struggles to generate reliable answers to the user's question regarding that image. Moreover, as new objects and events continuously emerge, frequently updating VLMs is impractical due to heavy computational burdens. To address this limitation, we propose Vision Search Assistant, a novel framework that facilitates collaboration between VLMs and web agents. This approach leverages VLMs' visual understanding capabilities and web agents' real-time information access to perform open-world Retrieval-Augmented Generation via the web. By integrating visual and textual representations through this collaboration, the model can provide informed responses even when the image is novel to the system. Extensive experiments conducted on both open-set and closed-set QA benchmarks demonstrate that the Vision Search Assistant significantly outperforms the other models and can be widely applied to existing VLMs.</description>

Abstract: Since the release of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains. A key challenge in developing these general capabilities is efficiently sourcing diverse, high-quality data. This becomes especially critical in reasoning-related tasks with sandbox checkers, such as math or code, where the goal is to generate correct solutions to specific problems with higher probability. In this work, we introduce Flaming-hot Initiation with Regular Execution (FIRE) sampling, a simple yet highly effective method to efficiently find good responses. Our empirical findings show that FIRE sampling enhances inference-time generation quality and also benefits training in the alignment stage. Furthermore, we explore how FIRE sampling improves performance by promoting diversity and analyze the impact of employing FIRE at different positions within a response.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval with Embeddings from Relevance Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building effective dense retrieval systems remains difficult when relevance supervision is not available. Recent work has looked to overcome this challenge by using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate hypothetical documents that can be used to find the closest real document. However, this approach relies solely on the LLM to have domain-specific knowledge relevant to the query, which may not be practical. Furthermore, generating hypothetical documents can be inefficient as it requires the LLM to generate a large number of tokens for each query. To address these challenges, we introduce Real Document Embeddings from Relevance Feedback (ReDE-RF). Inspired by relevance feedback, ReDE-RF proposes to re-frame hypothetical document generation as a relevance estimation task, using an LLM to select which documents should be used for nearest neighbor search. Through this re-framing, the LLM no longer needs domain-specific knowledge but only needs to judge what is relevant. Additionally, relevance estimation only requires the LLM to output a single token, thereby improving search latency. Our experiments show that ReDE-RF consistently surpasses state-of-the-art zero-shot dense retrieval methods across a wide range of low-resource retrieval datasets while also making significant improvements in latency per-query.</description>

      <title>Capacity-Aware Planning and Scheduling in Budget-Constrained Monotonic MDPs: A Meta-RL Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world sequential repair problems can be effectively modeled using monotonic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), where the system state stochastically decreases and can only be increased by performing a restorative action. This work addresses the problem of solving multi-component monotonic MDPs with both budget and capacity constraints. The budget constraint limits the total number of restorative actions and the capacity constraint limits the number of restorative actions that can be performed simultaneously. While prior methods dealt with budget constraints, including capacity constraints in prior methods leads to an exponential increase in computational complexity as the number of components in the MDP grows. We propose a two-step planning approach to address this challenge. First, we partition the components of the multi-component MDP into groups, where the number of groups is determined by the capacity constraint. We achieve this partitioning by solving a Linear Sum Assignment Problem (LSAP). Each group is then allocated a fraction of the total budget proportional to its size. This partitioning effectively decouples the large multi-component MDP into smaller subproblems, which are computationally feasible because the capacity constraint is simplified and the budget constraint can be addressed using existing methods. Subsequently, we use a meta-trained PPO agent to obtain an approximately optimal policy for each group. To validate our approach, we apply it to the problem of scheduling repairs for a large group of industrial robots, constrained by a limited number of repair technicians and a total repair budget. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in terms of maximizing the average uptime of the robot swarm, particularly for large swarm sizes.</description>

      <title>AutoBench-V: Can Large Vision-Language Models Benchmark Themselves?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have become essential for advancing the integration of visual and linguistic information, facilitating a wide range of complex applications and tasks. However, the evaluation of LVLMs presents significant challenges as the evaluation benchmark always demands lots of human cost for its construction, and remains static, lacking flexibility once constructed. Even though automatic evaluation has been explored in textual modality, the visual modality remains under-explored. As a result, in this work, we address a question: "Can LVLMs serve as a path to automatic benchmarking?". We introduce AutoBench-V, an automated framework for serving evaluation on demand, i.e., benchmarking LVLMs based on specific aspects of model capability. Upon receiving an evaluation capability, AutoBench-V leverages text-to-image models to generate relevant image samples and then utilizes LVLMs to orchestrate visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, completing the evaluation process efficiently and flexibly. Through an extensive evaluation of seven popular LVLMs across five demanded user inputs (i.e., evaluation capabilities), the framework shows effectiveness and reliability. We observe the following: (1) Our constructed benchmark accurately reflects varying task difficulties; (2) As task difficulty rises, the performance gap between models widens; (3) While models exhibit strong performance in abstract level understanding, they underperform in details reasoning tasks; and (4) Constructing a dataset with varying levels of difficulties is critical for a comprehensive and exhaustive evaluation. Overall, AutoBench-V not only successfully utilizes LVLMs for automated benchmarking but also reveals that LVLMs as judges have significant potential in various domains.</description>

      <title>BLAST: Block-Level Adaptive Structured Matrices for Efficient Deep Neural Network Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale foundation models have demonstrated exceptional performance in language and vision tasks. However, the numerous dense matrix-vector operations involved in these large networks pose significant computational challenges during inference. To address these challenges, we introduce the Block-Level Adaptive STructured (BLAST) matrix, designed to learn and leverage efficient structures prevalent in the weight matrices of linear layers within deep learning models. Compared to existing structured matrices, the BLAST matrix offers substantial flexibility, as it can represent various types of structures that are either learned from data or computed from pre-existing weight matrices. We demonstrate the efficiency of using the BLAST matrix for compressing both language and vision tasks, showing that (i) for medium-sized models such as ViT and GPT-2, training with BLAST weights boosts performance while reducing complexity by 70\% and 40\%, respectively; and (ii) for large foundation models such as Llama-7B and DiT-XL, the BLAST matrix achieves a 2x compression while exhibiting the lowest performance degradation among all tested structured matrices.

      <title>LARP: Tokenizing Videos with a Learned Autoregressive Generative Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present LARP, a novel video tokenizer designed to overcome limitations in current video tokenization methods for autoregressive (AR) generative models. Unlike traditional patchwise tokenizers that directly encode local visual patches into discrete tokens, LARP introduces a holistic tokenization scheme that gathers information from the visual content using a set of learned holistic queries. This design allows LARP to capture more global and semantic representations, rather than being limited to local patch-level information. Furthermore, it offers flexibility by supporting an arbitrary number of discrete tokens, enabling adaptive and efficient tokenization based on the specific requirements of the task. To align the discrete token space with downstream AR generation tasks, LARP integrates a lightweight AR transformer as a training-time prior model that predicts the next token on its discrete latent space. By incorporating the prior model during training, LARP learns a latent space that is not only optimized for video reconstruction but is also structured in a way that is more conducive to autoregressive generation. Moreover, this process defines a sequential order for the discrete tokens, progressively pushing them toward an optimal configuration during training, ensuring smoother and more accurate AR generation at inference time. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LARP's strong performance, achieving state-of-the-art FVD on the UCF101 class-conditional video generation benchmark. LARP enhances the compatibility of AR models with videos and opens up the potential to build unified high-fidelity multimodal large language models (MLLMs).</description>

      <title>EoRA: Training-free Compensation for Compressed LLM with Eigenspace Low-Rank Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we re-formulate the model compression problem into the customized compensation problem: Given a compressed model, we aim to introduce residual low-rank paths to compensate for compression errors under customized requirements from users (e.g., tasks, compression ratios), resulting in greater flexibility in adjusting overall capacity without being constrained by specific compression formats. However, naively applying SVD to derive residual paths causes suboptimal utilization of the low-rank representation capacity. Instead, we propose Training-free Eigenspace Low-Rank Approximation (EoRA), a method that directly minimizes compression-induced errors without requiring gradient-based training, achieving fast optimization in minutes using a small amount of calibration data. EoRA projects compression errors into the eigenspace of input activations, leveraging eigenvalues to effectively prioritize the reconstruction of high-importance error components. Moreover, EoRA can be seamlessly integrated with fine-tuning and quantization to further improve effectiveness and efficiency. EoRA consistently outperforms previous methods in compensating errors for compressed LLaMA2/3 models on various tasks, such as language generation, commonsense reasoning, and math reasoning tasks (e.g., 31.31%/12.88% and 9.69% improvements on ARC-Easy/ARC-Challenge and MathQA when compensating LLaMA3-8B that is quantized to 4-bit and pruned to 2:4 sparsity). EoRA offers a scalable, training-free solution to compensate for compression errors, making it a powerful tool to deploy LLMs in various capacity and efficiency requirements.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Action Recognition by Leveraging the Hierarchical Structure of Actions and Textual Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sequential execution of actions and their hierarchical structure consisting of different levels of abstraction, provide features that remain unexplored in the task of action recognition. In this study, we present a novel approach to improve action recognition by exploiting the hierarchical organization of actions and by incorporating contextualized textual information, including location and prior actions to reflect the sequential context. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel transformer architecture tailored for action recognition that utilizes both visual and textual features. Visual features are obtained from RGB and optical flow data, while text embeddings represent contextual information. Furthermore, we define a joint loss function to simultaneously train the model for both coarse and fine-grained action recognition, thereby exploiting the hierarchical nature of actions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we extend the Toyota Smarthome Untrimmed (TSU) dataset to introduce action hierarchies, introducing the Hierarchical TSU dataset. We also conduct an ablation study to assess the impact of different methods for integrating contextual and hierarchical data on action recognition performance. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms pre-trained SOTA methods when trained with the same hyperparameters. Moreover, they also show a 17.12% improvement in top-1 accuracy over the equivalent fine-grained RGB version when using ground-truth contextual information, and a 5.33% improvement when contextual information is obtained from actual predictions.</description>

      <title>GPT-4o System Card</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GPT-4o is an autoregressive omni model that accepts as input any combination of text, audio, image, and video, and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs. It's trained end-to-end across text, vision, and audio, meaning all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network. GPT-4o can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which is similar to human response time in conversation. It matches GPT-4 Turbo performance on text in English and code, with significant improvement on text in non-English languages, while also being much faster and 50\% cheaper in the API. GPT-4o is especially better at vision and audio understanding compared to existing models. In line with our commitment to building AI safely and consistent with our voluntary commitments to the White House, we are sharing the GPT-4o System Card, which includes our Preparedness Framework evaluations. In this System Card, we provide a detailed look at GPT-4o's capabilities, limitations, and safety evaluations across multiple categories, focusing on speech-to-speech while also evaluating text and image capabilities, and measures we've implemented to ensure the model is safe and aligned. We also include third-party assessments on dangerous capabilities, as well as discussion of potential societal impacts of GPT-4o's text and vision capabilities.</description>

      <title>On SCC-recursiveness in Quantitative Argumentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.08880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abstract argumentation is a reasoning model for evaluating arguments based on various semantics. SCC-recursiveness is a sophisticated property of semantics that provides a general schema for characterizing semantics through the decomposition along strongly connected components (SCCs). While this property has been extensively explored in various qualitative frameworks, it has been relatively neglected in quantitative argumentation. To fill this gap, we demonstrate that this property is well-suited to fuzzy extension semantics, which is a quantitative generalization of classical semantics in fuzzy argumentation frameworks (FAF). We tailor the SCC-recursive schema to enable the characterization of fuzzy extension semantics through the recursive decomposition of an FAF along its SCCs. Our contributions are twofold. Theoretically, we show that SCC-recursiveness provides an alternative approach to characterize fuzzy extension semantics, offering a deep understanding and better insight into these semantics. Practically, our schema provides a sound and complete algorithm for computing fuzzy extension semantics, which naturally reduces computational efforts when dealing with a large number of SCCs.</description>

      <title>A Model for Intelligible Interaction Between Agents That Predict and Explain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful form of data modelling with widespread applicability beyond its roots in the design of autonomous agents. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the interaction between people and ML systems. In this paper we view interaction between humans and ML systems within the broader context of communication between agents capable of prediction and explanation. We formalise the interaction model by taking agents to be automata with some special characteristics and define a protocol for communication between such agents. We define One- and Two-Way Intelligibility as properties that emerge at run-time by execution of the protocol. The formalisation allows us to identify conditions under which run-time sequences are bounded, and identify conditions under which the protocol can correctly implement an axiomatic specification of intelligible interaction between a human and an ML system. We also demonstrate using the formal model to: (a) identify instances of One- and Two-Way Intelligibility in literature reports on humans interacting with ML systems providing logic-based explanations, as is done in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP); and (b) map interactions between humans and machines in an elaborate natural-language based dialogue-model to One- or Two-Way Intelligible interactions in the formal model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), typified by OpenAI's GPT, have marked a significant advancement in artificial intelligence. Trained on vast amounts of text data, LLMs are capable of understanding and generating human-like text across a diverse range of topics. This study expands on the applications of LLMs, exploring their potential in data preprocessing, a critical stage in data mining and analytics applications. Aiming at tabular data, we delve into the applicability of state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4 and GPT-4o for a series of preprocessing tasks, including error detection, data imputation, schema matching, and entity matching. Alongside showcasing the inherent capabilities of LLMs, we highlight their limitations, particularly in terms of computational expense and inefficiency. We propose an LLM-based framework for data preprocessing, which integrates cutting-edge prompt engineering techniques, coupled with traditional methods like contextualization and feature selection, to improve the performance and efficiency of these models. The effectiveness of LLMs in data preprocessing is evaluated through an experimental study spanning a variety of public datasets. GPT-4 emerged as a standout, achieving 100\% accuracy or F1 score on 4 of these datasets, suggesting LLMs' immense potential in these tasks. Despite certain limitations, our study underscores the promise of LLMs in this domain and anticipates future developments to overcome current hurdles.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Nash Equilibrium Convergence in Monte Carlo Settings Through Counterfactual Value Based Fictitious Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03084v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) and its variants are widely recognized as effective algorithms for solving extensive-form imperfect information games. Recently, many improvements have been focused on enhancing the convergence speed of the CFR algorithm. However, most of these variants are not applicable under Monte Carlo (MC) conditions, making them unsuitable for training in large-scale games. We introduce a new MC-based algorithm for solving extensive-form imperfect information games, called MCCFVFP (Monte Carlo Counterfactual Value-Based Fictitious Play). MCCFVFP combines CFR's counterfactual value calculations with fictitious play's best response strategy, leveraging the strengths of fictitious play to gain significant advantages in games with a high proportion of dominated strategies. Experimental results show that MCCFVFP achieved convergence speeds approximately 20\%$\sim$50\% faster than the most advanced MCCFR variants in games like poker and other test games.</description>

      <title>Internet of Federated Digital Twins (IoFDT): Connecting Twins Beyond Borders for Society 5.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of digital twin (DT), which enables the creation of a programmable, digital representation of physical systems, is expected to revolutionize future industries and will lie at the heart of the vision of a future smart society, namely, Society 5.0, in which high integration between cyber (digital) and physical spaces is exploited to bring economic and societal advancements. However, the success of such a DT-driven Society 5.0 requires a synergistic convergence of artificial intelligence and networking technologies into an integrated, programmable system that can coordinate DT networks to effectively deliver diverse Society 5.0 services. Prior works remain restricted to either qualitative study, simple analysis or software implementations of a single DT, and thus, they cannot provide the highly synergistic integration of digital and physical spaces as required by Society 5.0. In contrast, this paper envisions a novel concept of an Internet of Federated Digital Twins (IoFDT) that holistically integrates heterogeneous and physically separated DTs representing different Society 5.0 services within a single framework and system. For this concept of IoFDT, we first introduce a hierarchical architecture that integrates federated DTs through horizontal and vertical interactions, bridging cyber and physical spaces to unlock new possibilities. Then, we discuss challenges of realizing IoFDT, highlighting the intricacies across communication, computing, and AI-native networks while also underscoring potential innovative solutions. Subsequently, we elaborate on the importance of the implementation of a unified IoFDT platform that integrates all technical components and orchestrates their interactions, emphasizing the necessity of practical experimental platforms with a focus on real-world applications in areas like smart mobility.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been utilized in social simulations, where they are often guided by carefully crafted instructions to stably exhibit human-like behaviors during simulations. Nevertheless, we doubt the necessity of shaping agents' behaviors for accurate social simulations. Instead, this paper emphasizes the importance of spontaneous phenomena, wherein agents deeply engage in contexts and make adaptive decisions without explicit directions. We explored spontaneous cooperation across three competitive scenarios and successfully simulated the gradual emergence of cooperation, findings that align closely with human behavioral data. This approach not only aids the computational social science community in bridging the gap between simulations and real-world dynamics but also offers the AI community a novel method to assess LLMs' capability of deliberate reasoning.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated into an agent framework for flexible and effective personal mobility generation. LLMs overcome the limitations of previous models by effectively processing semantic data and offering versatility in modeling various tasks. Our approach addresses three research questions: aligning LLMs with real-world urban mobility data, developing reliable activity generation strategies, and exploring LLM applications in urban mobility. The key technical contribution is a novel LLM agent framework that accounts for individual activity patterns and motivations, including a self-consistency approach to align LLMs with real-world activity data and a retrieval-augmented strategy for interpretable activity generation. We evaluate our LLM agent framework and compare it with state-of-the-art personal mobility generation approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and its potential applications in urban mobility. Overall, this study marks the pioneering work of designing an LLM agent framework for activity generation based on real-world human activity data, offering a promising tool for urban mobility analysis.</description>

      <title>Getting More Juice Out of the SFT Data: Reward Learning from Human Demonstration Improves SFT for LLM Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for contemporary foundation models. State-of-the-art techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often consist of two stages: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where the model is fine-tuned by learning from human demonstration data; 2) Preference learning, where preference data is used to learn a reward model, which is in turn used by a reinforcement learning (RL) step to fine-tune the model. Such reward model serves as a proxy to human preference, and it is critical to guide the RL step towards improving the model quality. In this work, we argue that the SFT stage significantly benefits from learning a reward model as well. Instead of using the human demonstration data directly via supervised learning, we propose to leverage an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) technique to simultaneously build an reward model and a policy model. This approach leads to new SFT algorithms that are not only efficient to implement, but are robust to the presence of low-quality supervised learning data. Moreover, we discover a connection between the proposed IRL based approach, and a recent line of works called Self-Play Fine-tune (SPIN). Theoretically, we show that the proposed algorithms converge to the stationary solutions of the IRL problem. Empirically, we align 1B and 7B models using proposed methods and evaluate them on a reward benchmark model and the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard. The proposed methods show significant performance improvement over existing SFT approaches. Our results indicate that it is beneficial to leverage reward learning throughout the entire alignment process.</description>

      <title>Artificial Generational Intelligence: Cultural Accumulation in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cultural accumulation drives the open-ended and diverse progress in capabilities spanning human history. It builds an expanding body of knowledge and skills by combining individual exploration with inter-generational information transmission. Despite its widespread success among humans, the capacity for artificial learning agents to accumulate culture remains under-explored. In particular, approaches to reinforcement learning typically strive for improvements over only a single lifetime. Generational algorithms that do exist fail to capture the open-ended, emergent nature of cultural accumulation, which allows individuals to trade-off innovation and imitation. Building on the previously demonstrated ability for reinforcement learning agents to perform social learning, we find that training setups which balance this with independent learning give rise to cultural accumulation. These accumulating agents outperform those trained for a single lifetime with the same cumulative experience. We explore this accumulation by constructing two models under two distinct notions of a generation: episodic generations, in which accumulation occurs via in-context learning and train-time generations, in which accumulation occurs via in-weights learning. In-context and in-weights cultural accumulation can be interpreted as analogous to knowledge and skill accumulation, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to present general models that achieve emergent cultural accumulation in reinforcement learning, opening up new avenues towards more open-ended learning systems, as well as presenting new opportunities for modelling human culture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging the powerful generative capability of diffusion models (DMs) to build decision-making agents has achieved extensive success. However, there is still a demand for an easy-to-use and modularized open-source library that offers customized and efficient development for DM-based decision-making algorithms. In this work, we introduce CleanDiffuser, the first DM library specifically designed for decision-making algorithms. By revisiting the roles of DMs in the decision-making domain, we identify a set of essential sub-modules that constitute the core of CleanDiffuser, allowing for the implementation of various DM algorithms with simple and flexible building blocks. To demonstrate the reliability and flexibility of CleanDiffuser, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of various DM algorithms implemented with CleanDiffuser across an extensive range of tasks. The analytical experiments provide a wealth of valuable design choices and insights, reveal opportunities and challenges, and lay a solid groundwork for future research. CleanDiffuser will provide long-term support to the decision-making community, enhancing reproducibility and fostering the development of more robust solutions. The code and documentation of CleanDiffuser are open-sourced on the https://github.com/CleanDiffuserTeam/CleanDiffuser.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce TorchOpera, a compound AI system for enhancing the safety and quality of prompts and responses for Large Language Models. TorchOpera ensures that all user prompts are safe, contextually grounded, and effectively processed, while enhancing LLM responses to be relevant and high quality. TorchOpera utilizes the vector database for contextual grounding, rule-based wrappers for flexible modifications, and specialized mechanisms for detecting and adjusting unsafe or incorrect content. We also provide a view of the compound AI system to reduce the computational cost. Extensive experiments show that TorchOpera ensures the safety, reliability, and applicability of LLMs in real-world settings while maintaining the efficiency of LLM responses.</description>

      <title>Bayesian-LoRA: LoRA based Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning using Optimal Quantization levels and Rank Values trough Differentiable Bayesian Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a common practice in natural language processing to pre-train a single model on a general domain and then fine-tune it for downstream tasks. However, when it comes to Large Language Models, fine-tuning the entire model can be computationally expensive, resulting in very intensive energy consumption. As a result, several Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approaches were recently proposed. One of the most popular approaches is low-rank adaptation (LoRA), where the key insight is decomposing the update weights of the pre-trained model into two low-rank matrices. However, the proposed approaches either use the same rank value across all different weight matrices, which has been shown to be a sub-optimal choice, or do not use any quantization technique, one of the most important factors when it comes to a model's energy consumption. In this work, we propose Bayesian-LoRA which approaches low-rank adaptation and quantization from a Bayesian perspective by employing a prior distribution on both quantization levels and rank values. As a result, B-LoRA is able to fine-tune a pre-trained model on a specific downstream task, finding the optimal rank values and quantization levels for every low-rank matrix. We validate the proposed model by fine-tuning a pre-trained DeBERTaV3 on the GLUE benchmark. Moreover, we compare it to relevant baselines and present both qualitative and quantitative results, showing how the proposed approach is able to learn optimal-rank quantized matrices. B-LoRA performs on par with or better than the baselines while reducing the total number of bit operations by roughly 70% compared to the baseline methods.</description>

      <title>SE(3)-bi-equivariant Transformers for Point Cloud Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a pair of point clouds, the goal of assembly is to recover a rigid transformation that aligns one point cloud to the other. This task is challenging because the point clouds may be non-overlapped, and they may have arbitrary initial positions. To address these difficulties, we propose a method, called SE(3)-bi-equivariant transformer (BITR), based on the SE(3)-bi-equivariance prior of the task: it guarantees that when the inputs are rigidly perturbed, the output will transform accordingly. Due to its equivariance property, BITR can not only handle non-overlapped PCs, but also guarantee robustness against initial positions. Specifically, BITR first extracts features of the inputs using a novel $SE(3) \times SE(3)$-transformer, and then projects the learned feature to group SE(3) as the output. Moreover, we theoretically show that swap and scale equivariances can be incorporated into BITR, thus it further guarantees stable performance under scaling and swapping the inputs. We experimentally show the effectiveness of BITR in practical tasks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Target Assignment and Path Finding for Intelligent Warehouse: A Cooperative Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent target assignment and path planning (TAPF) are two key problems in intelligent warehouse. However, most literature only addresses one of these two problems separately. In this study, we propose a method to simultaneously solve target assignment and path planning from a perspective of cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to model the TAPF problem for intelligent warehouse to cooperative multi-agent deep RL, and the first to simultaneously address TAPF based on multi-agent deep RL. Furthermore, previous literature rarely considers the physical dynamics of agents. In this study, the physical dynamics of the agents is considered. Experimental results show that our method performs well in various task settings, which means that the target assignment is solved reasonably well and the planned path is almost shortest. Moreover, our method is more time-efficient than baselines.</description>

      <title>AIME: AI System Optimization via Multiple LLM Evaluators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-based AI system optimization typically involves a feedback loop scheme where a single LLM generates an evaluation in natural language of the current output to improve the next iteration's output. However, in this work, we empirically demonstrate that for a practical and complex task (code generation) with multiple criteria to evaluate, utilizing only one LLM evaluator tends to let errors in generated code go undetected, thus leading to incorrect evaluations and ultimately suboptimal test case performance. Motivated by this failure case, we assume there exists an optimal evaluation policy that samples an evaluation between response and ground truth. We then theoretically prove that a linear combination of multiple evaluators can approximate this optimal policy. From this insight, we propose AI system optimization via Multiple LLM Evaluators (AIME). AIME is an evaluation protocol that utilizes multiple LLMs that each independently generate an evaluation on separate criteria and then combine them via concatenation. We provide an extensive empirical study showing AIME outperforming baseline methods in code generation tasks, with up to $62\%$ higher error detection rate and up to $16\%$ higher success rate than a single LLM evaluation protocol on LeetCodeHard and HumanEval datasets. We also show that the selection of the number of evaluators and which criteria to utilize is non-trivial as it can impact pact success rate by up to $12\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific innovation is pivotal for humanity, and harnessing large language models (LLMs) to generate research ideas could transform discovery. However, existing LLMs often produce simplistic and repetitive suggestions due to their limited ability in acquiring external knowledge for innovation. To address this problem, we introduce an enhanced planning and search methodology designed to boost the creative potential of LLM-based systems. Our approach involves an iterative process to purposely plan the retrieval of external knowledge, progressively enriching the idea generation with broader and deeper insights. Validation through automated and human assessments indicates that our framework substantially elevates the quality of generated ideas, particularly in novelty and diversity. The number of unique novel ideas produced by our framework is 3.4 times higher than without it. Moreover, our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art, generating at least 2.5 times more top-rated ideas based on 170 seed papers in a Swiss Tournament evaluation.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs "know" internally when they follow instructions?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instruction-following is crucial for building AI agents with large language models (LLMs), as these models must adhere strictly to user-provided constraints and guidelines. However, LLMs often fail to follow even simple and clear instructions. To improve instruction-following behavior and prevent undesirable outputs, a deeper understanding of how LLMs' internal states relate to these outcomes is required. Our analysis of LLM internal states reveal a dimension in the input embedding space linked to successful instruction-following. We demonstrate that modifying representations along this dimension improves instruction-following success rates compared to random changes, without compromising response quality. Further investigation reveals that this dimension is more closely related to the phrasing of prompts rather than the inherent difficulty of the task or instructions. This discovery also suggests explanations for why LLMs sometimes fail to follow clear instructions and why prompt engineering is often effective, even when the content remains largely unchanged. This work provides insight into the internal workings of LLMs' instruction-following, paving the way for reliable LLM agents.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs estimate uncertainty well in instruction-following?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) could be valuable personal AI agents across various domains, provided they can precisely follow user instructions. However, recent studies have shown significant limitations in LLMs' instruction-following capabilities, raising concerns about their reliability in high-stakes applications. Accurately estimating LLMs' uncertainty in adhering to instructions is critical to mitigating deployment risks. We present, to our knowledge, the first systematic evaluation of the uncertainty estimation abilities of LLMs in the context of instruction-following. Our study identifies key challenges with existing instruction-following benchmarks, where multiple factors are entangled with uncertainty stems from instruction-following, complicating the isolation and comparison across methods and models. To address these issues, we introduce a controlled evaluation setup with two benchmark versions of data, enabling a comprehensive comparison of uncertainty estimation methods under various conditions. Our findings show that existing uncertainty methods struggle, particularly when models make subtle errors in instruction following. While internal model states provide some improvement, they remain inadequate in more complex scenarios. The insights from our controlled evaluation setups provide a crucial understanding of LLMs' limitations and potential for uncertainty estimation in instruction-following tasks, paving the way for more trustworthy AI agents.</description>

      <title>Non-myopic Generation of Language Models for Reasoning and Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in reasoning and planning by breaking down complex problems into sequential steps. Despite their success in various domains like mathematical problem-solving and coding, LLMs face challenges in ensuring reliable and optimal planning due to their inherent myopic nature of autoregressive decoding. This paper revisits LLM reasoning from an optimal-control perspective, proposing a novel method, Predictive-Decoding, that leverages Model Predictive Control to enhance planning accuracy. By re-weighting LLM distributions based on foresight trajectories, Predictive-Decoding aims to mitigate early errors and promote non-myopic planning. Our experiments show significant improvements in a wide range of tasks for math, coding, and agents.

      <title>R-CoT: Reverse Chain-of-Thought Problem Generation for Geometric Reasoning in Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) struggle with mathematical geometric reasoning due to a lack of high-quality image-text paired data. Current geometric data generation approaches, which apply preset templates to generate geometric data or use Large Language Models (LLMs) to rephrase questions and answers (Q&amp;A), unavoidably limit data accuracy and diversity. To synthesize higher-quality data, we propose a two-stage Reverse Chain-of-Thought (R-CoT) geometry problem generation pipeline. First, we introduce GeoChain to produce high-fidelity geometric images and corresponding descriptions highlighting relations among geometric elements. We then design a Reverse A&amp;Q method that reasons step-by-step based on the descriptions and generates questions in reverse from the reasoning results. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method brings significant and consistent improvements on multiple LMM baselines, achieving new performance records in the 2B, 7B, and 8B settings. Notably, R-CoT-8B significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art open-source mathematical models by 16.6% on MathVista and 9.2% on GeoQA, while also surpassing the closed-source model GPT-4o by an average of 13% across both datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/dle666/R-CoT.</description>

      <title>Backdoor in Seconds: Unlocking Vulnerabilities in Large Pre-trained Models via Model Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large pre-trained models have achieved notable success across a range of downstream tasks. However, recent research shows that a type of adversarial attack ($\textit{i.e.,}$ backdoor attack) can manipulate the behavior of machine learning models through contaminating their training dataset, posing significant threat in the real-world application of large pre-trained model, especially for those customized models. Therefore, addressing the unique challenges for exploring vulnerability of pre-trained models is of paramount importance. Through empirical studies on the capability for performing backdoor attack in large pre-trained models ($\textit{e.g.,}$ ViT), we find the following unique challenges of attacking large pre-trained models: 1) the inability to manipulate or even access large training datasets, and 2) the substantial computational resources required for training or fine-tuning these models. To address these challenges, we establish new standards for an effective and feasible backdoor attack in the context of large pre-trained models. In line with these standards, we introduce our EDT model, an \textbf{E}fficient, \textbf{D}ata-free, \textbf{T}raining-free backdoor attack method. Inspired by model editing techniques, EDT injects an editing-based lightweight codebook into the backdoor of large pre-trained models, which replaces the embedding of the poisoned image with the target image without poisoning the training dataset or training the victim model. Our experiments, conducted across various pre-trained models such as ViT, CLIP, BLIP, and stable diffusion, and on downstream tasks including image classification, image captioning, and image generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available in the supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Demand Driven Services in Logistics and Transportation Systems: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.04462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent technology development brings the boom of numerous new Demand-Driven Services (DDS) into urban lives, including ridesharing, on-demand delivery, express systems and warehousing. In DDS, a service loop is an elemental structure, including its service worker, the service providers and corresponding service targets. The service workers should transport either people or parcels from the providers to the target locations. Various planning tasks within DDS can thus be classified into two individual stages: 1) Dispatching, which is to form service loops from demand/supply distributions, and 2) Routing, which is to decide specific serving orders within the constructed loops. Generating high-quality strategies in both stages is important to develop DDS but faces several challenges. Meanwhile, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been developed rapidly in recent years. It is a powerful tool to solve these problems since DRL can learn a parametric model without relying on too many problem-based assumptions and optimize long-term effects by learning sequential decisions. In this survey, we first define DDS, then highlight common applications and important decision/control problems within. For each problem, we comprehensively introduce the existing DRL solutions. We also introduce open simulation environments for development and evaluation of DDS applications. Finally, we analyze remaining challenges and discuss further research opportunities in DRL solutions for DDS.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Multi-Aspect Explainability Analyses on Machine Reading Comprehension Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.11574v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving human-level performance on some of the Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) datasets is no longer challenging with the help of powerful Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). However, the internal mechanism of these artifacts remains unclear, placing an obstacle for further understanding these models. This paper focuses on conducting a series of analytical experiments to examine the relations between the multi-head self-attention and the final MRC system performance, revealing the potential explainability in PLM-based MRC models. To ensure the robustness of the analyses, we perform our experiments in a multilingual way on top of various PLMs. We discover that passage-to-question and passage understanding attentions are the most important ones in the question answering process, showing strong correlations to the final performance than other parts. Through comprehensive visualizations and case studies, we also observe several general findings on the attention maps, which can be helpful to understand how these models solve the questions.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks with Feature and Structure Aware Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received increasing attention for representation learning in various machine learning tasks. However, most existing GNNs applying neighborhood aggregation usually perform poorly on the graph with heterophily where adjacent nodes belong to different classes. In this paper, we show that in typical heterphilous graphs, the edges may be directed, and whether to treat the edges as is or simply make them undirected greatly affects the performance of the GNN models. Furthermore, due to the limitation of heterophily, it is highly beneficial for the nodes to aggregate messages from similar nodes beyond local neighborhood.These motivate us to develop a model that adaptively learns the directionality of the graph, and exploits the underlying long-distance correlations between nodes. We first generalize the graph Laplacian to digraph based on the proposed Feature-Aware PageRank algorithm, which simultaneously considers the graph directionality and long-distance feature similarity between nodes. Then digraph Laplacian defines a graph propagation matrix that leads to a model called {\em DiglacianGCN}. Based on this, we further leverage the node proximity measured by commute times between nodes, in order to preserve the nodes' long-distance correlation on the topology level. Extensive experiments on ten datasets with different levels of homophily demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over existing solutions in the task of node classification.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Salient Contributions in Neuron Activation with Attribution Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.11109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the remarkable success of deep neural networks, there is a growing interest in research aimed at providing clear interpretations of their decision-making processes. In this paper, we introduce Attribution Equilibrium, a novel method to decompose output predictions into fine-grained attributions, balancing positive and negative relevance for clearer visualization of the evidence behind a network decision. We carefully analyze conventional approaches to decision explanation and present a different perspective on the conservation of evidence. We define the evidence as a gap between positive and negative influences among gradient-derived initial contribution maps. Then, we incorporate antagonistic elements and a user-defined criterion for the degree of positive attribution during propagation. Additionally, we consider the role of inactivated neurons in the propagation rule, thereby enhancing the discernment of less relevant elements such as the background. We conduct various assessments in a verified experimental environment with PASCAL VOC 2007, MS COCO 2014, and ImageNet datasets. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing attribution methods both qualitatively and quantitatively in identifying the key input features that influence model decisions.</description>

      <title>Adversarial robustness of VAEs through the lens of local geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an unsupervised attack on variational autoencoders (VAEs), an adversary finds a small perturbation in an input sample that significantly changes its latent space encoding, thereby compromising the reconstruction for a fixed decoder. A known reason for such vulnerability is the distortions in the latent space resulting from a mismatch between approximated latent posterior and a prior distribution. Consequently, a slight change in an input sample can move its encoding to a low/zero density region in the latent space resulting in an unconstrained generation. This paper demonstrates that an optimal way for an adversary to attack VAEs is to exploit a directional bias of a stochastic pullback metric tensor induced by the encoder and decoder networks. The pullback metric tensor of an encoder measures the change in infinitesimal latent volume from an input to a latent space. Thus, it can be viewed as a lens to analyse the effect of input perturbations leading to latent space distortions. We propose robustness evaluation scores using the eigenspectrum of a pullback metric tensor. Moreover, we empirically show that the scores correlate with the robustness parameter $\beta$ of the $\beta-$VAE. Since increasing $\beta$ also degrades reconstruction quality, we demonstrate a simple alternative using \textit{mixup} training to fill the empty regions in the latent space, thus improving robustness with improved reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Developmental Plasticity-inspired Adaptive Pruning for Deep Spiking and Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developmental plasticity plays a prominent role in shaping the brain's structure during ongoing learning in response to dynamically changing environments. However, the existing network compression methods for deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) and spiking neural networks (SNNs) draw little inspiration from brain's developmental plasticity mechanisms, thus limiting their ability to learn efficiently, rapidly, and accurately. This paper proposed a developmental plasticity-inspired adaptive pruning (DPAP) method, with inspiration from the adaptive developmental pruning of dendritic spines, synapses, and neurons according to the ``use it or lose it, gradually decay" principle. The proposed DPAP model considers multiple biologically realistic mechanisms (such as dendritic spine dynamic plasticity, activity-dependent neural spiking trace, and local synaptic plasticity), with additional adaptive pruning strategy, so that the network structure can be dynamically optimized during learning without any pre-training and retraining. Extensive comparative experiments show consistent and remarkable performance and speed boost with the extremely compressed networks on a diverse set of benchmark tasks for deep ANNs and SNNs, especially the spatio-temporal joint pruning of SNNs in neuromorphic datasets. This work explores how developmental plasticity enables complex deep networks to gradually evolve into brain-like efficient and compact structures, eventually achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for biologically realistic SNNs.</description>

      <title>Frustratingly Easy Label Projection for Cross-lingual Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15613v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Translating training data into many languages has emerged as a practical solution for improving cross-lingual transfer. For tasks that involve span-level annotations, such as information extraction or question answering, an additional label projection step is required to map annotated spans onto the translated texts. Recently, a few efforts have utilized a simple mark-then-translate method to jointly perform translation and projection by inserting special markers around the labeled spans in the original sentence. However, as far as we are aware, no empirical analysis has been conducted on how this approach compares to traditional annotation projection based on word alignment. In this paper, we present an extensive empirical study across 57 languages and three tasks (QA, NER, and Event Extraction) to evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of both methods, filling an important gap in the literature. Experimental results show that our optimized version of mark-then-translate, which we call EasyProject, is easily applied to many languages and works surprisingly well, outperforming the more complex word alignment-based methods. We analyze several key factors that affect the end-task performance, and show EasyProject works well because it can accurately preserve label span boundaries after translation. We will publicly release all our code and data.</description>

      <title>GREAT Score: Global Robustness Evaluation of Adversarial Perturbation using Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current studies on adversarial robustness mainly focus on aggregating local robustness results from a set of data samples to evaluate and rank different models. However, the local statistics may not well represent the true global robustness of the underlying unknown data distribution. To address this challenge, this paper makes the first attempt to present a new framework, called GREAT Score , for global robustness evaluation of adversarial perturbation using generative models. Formally, GREAT Score carries the physical meaning of a global statistic capturing a mean certified attack-proof perturbation level over all samples drawn from a generative model. For finite-sample evaluation, we also derive a probabilistic guarantee on the sample complexity and the difference between the sample mean and the true mean. GREAT Score has several advantages: (1) Robustness evaluations using GREAT Score are efficient and scalable to large models, by sparing the need of running adversarial attacks. In particular, we show high correlation and significantly reduced computation cost of GREAT Score when compared to the attack-based model ranking on RobustBench (Croce,et. al. 2021). (2) The use of generative models facilitates the approximation of the unknown data distribution. In our ablation study with different generative adversarial networks (GANs), we observe consistency between global robustness evaluation and the quality of GANs. (3) GREAT Score can be used for remote auditing of privacy-sensitive black-box models, as demonstrated by our robustness evaluation on several online facial recognition services.</description>

      <title>ToMChallenges: A Principle-Guided Dataset and Diverse Evaluation Tasks for Exploring Theory of Mind</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM), the capacity to comprehend the mental states of distinct individuals, is essential for numerous practical applications. With the development of large language models (LLMs), there is a heated debate about whether they are able to perform ToM tasks. Previous studies have used different tasks and prompts to test the ToM on LLMs and the results are inconsistent: some studies asserted these models are capable of exhibiting ToM, while others suggest the opposite. In this study, We present ToMChallenges, a dataset for comprehensively evaluating the Theory of Mind based on the Sally-Anne and Smarties tests with a diverse set of tasks. In addition, we also propose an auto-grader to streamline the answer evaluation process. We tested three models: davinci, turbo, and gpt-4. Our evaluation results and error analyses show that LLMs have inconsistent behaviors across prompts and tasks. Performing the ToM tasks robustly remains a challenge for the LLMs. In addition, our paper wants to raise awareness in evaluating the ToM in LLMs and we want to invite more discussion on how to design the prompts and tasks for ToM tasks that can better assess the LLMs' ability.</description>

      <title>C-MCTS: Safe Planning with Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16209v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) formulation allows to solve safety-critical decision making tasks that are subject to constraints. While CMDPs have been extensively studied in the Reinforcement Learning literature, little attention has been given to sampling-based planning algorithms such as MCTS for solving them. Previous approaches perform conservatively with respect to costs as they avoid constraint violations by using Monte Carlo cost estimates that suffer from high variance. We propose Constrained MCTS (C-MCTS), which estimates cost using a safety critic that is trained with Temporal Difference learning in an offline phase prior to agent deployment. The critic limits exploration by pruning unsafe trajectories within MCTS during deployment. C-MCTS satisfies cost constraints but operates closer to the constraint boundary, achieving higher rewards than previous work. As a nice byproduct, the planner is more efficient w.r.t. planning steps. Most importantly, under model mismatch between the planner and the real world, C-MCTS is less susceptible to cost violations than previous work.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Bayesian Networks for Predicting Cryptocurrency Price Directions: Uncovering Causal Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity across various sectors, especially in finance and investment. Despite their growing popularity, cryptocurrencies can be a high-risk investment due to their price volatility. The inherent volatility in cryptocurrency prices, coupled with the effects of external global economic factors, makes predicting their price movements challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN)-based approach to uncover potential causal relationships among various features including social media data, traditional financial market factors, and technical indicators. Six popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Binance Coin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and Tether are studied in this work. The proposed model's performance is compared to five baseline models of auto-regressive integrated moving average, support vector regression, long short-term memory, random forests, and support vector machines. The results show that while DBN performance varies across cryptocurrencies, with some cryptocurrencies exhibiting higher predictive accuracy than others, the DBN significantly outperforms the baseline models.</description>

      <title>DEDUCE: Multi-head attention decoupled contrastive learning to discover cancer subtypes based on multi-omics data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04075v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background and Objective: Given the high heterogeneity and clinical diversity of cancer, substantial variations exist in multi-omics data and clinical features across different cancer subtypes. Methods: We propose a model, named DEDUCE, based on a symmetric multi-head attention encoders (SMAE), for unsupervised contrastive learning to analyze multi-omics cancer data, with the aim of identifying and characterizing cancer subtypes. This model adopts a unsupervised SMAE that can deeply extract contextual features and long-range dependencies from multi-omics data, thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Importantly, DEDUCE introduces a subtype decoupled contrastive learning method based on a multi-head attention mechanism to simultaneously learn features from multi-omics data and perform clustering for identifying cancer subtypes. Subtypes are clustered by calculating the similarity between samples in both the feature space and sample space of multi-omics data. The fundamental concept involves decoupling various attributes of multi-omics data features and learning them as contrasting terms. A contrastive loss function is constructed to quantify the disparity between positive and negative examples, and the model minimizes this difference, thereby promoting the acquisition of enhanced feature representation. Results: The DEDUCE model undergoes extensive experiments on simulated multi-omics datasets, single-cell multi-omics datasets, and cancer multi-omics datasets, outperforming 10 deep learning models. The DEDUCE model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each module in the DEDUCE model. Finally, we applied the DEDUCE model to identify six cancer subtypes of AML.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Reorganization of Neural Pathways for Continual Learning with Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The human brain can self-organize rich and diverse sparse neural pathways to incrementally master hundreds of cognitive tasks. However, most existing continual learning algorithms for deep artificial and spiking neural networks are unable to adequately auto-regulate the limited resources in the network, which leads to performance drop along with energy consumption rise as the increase of tasks. In this paper, we propose a brain-inspired continual learning algorithm with adaptive reorganization of neural pathways, which employs Self-Organizing Regulation networks to reorganize the single and limited Spiking Neural Network (SOR-SNN) into rich sparse neural pathways to efficiently cope with incremental tasks. The proposed model demonstrates consistent superiority in performance, energy consumption, and memory capacity on diverse continual learning tasks ranging from child-like simple to complex tasks, as well as on generalized CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets. In particular, the SOR-SNN model excels at learning more complex tasks as well as more tasks, and is able to integrate the past learned knowledge with the information from the current task, showing the backward transfer ability to facilitate the old tasks. Meanwhile, the proposed model exhibits self-repairing ability to irreversible damage and for pruned networks, could automatically allocate new pathway from the retained network to recover memory for forgotten knowledge.</description>

      <title>PrivacyMind: Large Language Models Can Be Contextual Privacy Protection Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven considerable interest in fine-tuning them with domain-specific data to create specialized language models. Nevertheless, such domain-specific fine-tuning data often contains contextually sensitive personally identifiable information (PII). Direct fine-tuning of LLMs on this data without privacy protection poses a risk of data leakage of sensitive PII during inference time. To address this challenge, we introduce Contextual Privacy Protection Language Models (PrivacyMind), a novel paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs that effectively injects domain-specific knowledge while safeguarding inference-time data privacy. Our work offers a theoretical analysis for model design and benchmarks various techniques such as corpus curation, penalty-based unlikelihood in training loss, instruction-based tuning, etc. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches. In particular, instruction tuning with both positive and negative examples stands out as a promising method, effectively protecting private data while enhancing the model's knowledge. Our work underscores the potential for Large Language Models as robust contextual privacy protection learners. The complete code and data for the work can be found at https://github.com/Yijia-Xiao/PrivacyMind.</description>

      <title>Learning to Reach Goals via Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02505v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel perspective on goal-conditioned reinforcement learning by framing it within the context of denoising diffusion models. Analogous to the diffusion process, where Gaussian noise is used to create random trajectories that walk away from the data manifold, we construct trajectories that move away from potential goal states. We then learn a goal-conditioned policy to reverse these deviations, analogous to the score function. This approach, which we call Merlin, can reach specified goals from arbitrary initial states without learning a separate value function. In contrast to recent works utilizing diffusion models in offline RL, Merlin stands out as the first method to perform diffusion in the state space, requiring only one ``denoising" iteration per environment step. We experimentally validate our approach in various offline goal-reaching tasks, demonstrating substantial performance enhancements compared to state-of-the-art methods while improving computational efficiency over other diffusion-based RL methods by an order of magnitude. Our results suggest that this perspective on diffusion for RL is a simple and scalable approach for sequential decision making.</description>

      <title>Aligning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Reward Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have recently emerged at the forefront of image generation, powered by very large-scale unsupervised or weakly supervised text-to-image training datasets. Due to their unsupervised training, controlling their behavior in downstream tasks, such as maximizing human-perceived image quality, image-text alignment, or ethical image generation, is difficult. Recent works finetune diffusion models to downstream reward functions using vanilla reinforcement learning, notorious for the high variance of the gradient estimators. In this paper, we propose AlignProp, a method that aligns diffusion models to downstream reward functions using end-to-end backpropagation of the reward gradient through the denoising process. While naive implementation of such backpropagation would require prohibitive memory resources for storing the partial derivatives of modern text-to-image models, AlignProp finetunes low-rank adapter weight modules and uses gradient checkpointing, to render its memory usage viable. We test AlignProp in finetuning diffusion models to various objectives, such as image-text semantic alignment, aesthetics, compressibility and controllability of the number of objects present, as well as their combinations. We show AlignProp achieves higher rewards in fewer training steps than alternatives, while being conceptually simpler, making it a straightforward choice for optimizing diffusion models for differentiable reward functions of interest. Code and Visualization results are available at https://align-prop.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Brain Networks and Intelligence: A Graph Neural Network Based Approach to Resting State fMRI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) is a powerful tool for investigating the relationship between brain function and cognitive processes as it allows for the functional organization of the brain to be captured without relying on a specific task or stimuli. In this paper, we present a novel modeling architecture called BrainRGIN for predicting intelligence (fluid, crystallized, and total intelligence) using graph neural networks on rsfMRI derived static functional network connectivity matrices. Extending from the existing graph convolution networks, our approach incorporates a clustering-based embedding and graph isomorphism network in the graph convolutional layer to reflect the nature of the brain sub-network organization and efficient network expression, in combination with TopK pooling and attention-based readout functions. We evaluated our proposed architecture on a large dataset, specifically the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Dataset, and demonstrated its effectiveness in predicting individual differences in intelligence. Our model achieved lower mean squared errors and higher correlation scores than existing relevant graph architectures and other traditional machine learning models for all of the intelligence prediction tasks. The middle frontal gyrus exhibited a significant contribution to both fluid and crystallized intelligence, suggesting their pivotal role in these cognitive processes. Total composite scores identified a diverse set of brain regions to be relevant which underscores the complex nature of total intelligence.</description>

      <title>HEALNet: Multimodal Fusion for Heterogeneous Biomedical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Technological advances in medical data collection, such as high-throughput genomic sequencing and digital high-resolution histopathology, have contributed to the rising requirement for multimodal biomedical modelling, specifically for image, tabular and graph data. Most multimodal deep learning approaches use modality-specific architectures that are often trained separately and cannot capture the crucial cross-modal information that motivates the integration of different data sources. This paper presents the Hybrid Early-fusion Attention Learning Network (HEALNet): a flexible multimodal fusion architecture, which a) preserves modality-specific structural information, b) captures the cross-modal interactions and structural information in a shared latent space, c) can effectively handle missing modalities during training and inference, and d) enables intuitive model inspection by learning on the raw data input instead of opaque embeddings. We conduct multimodal survival analysis on Whole Slide Images and Multi-omic data on four cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). HEALNet achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other end-to-end trained fusion models, substantially improving over unimodal and multimodal baselines whilst being robust in scenarios with missing modalities.</description>

      <title>LaRS: Latent Reasoning Skills for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04684v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a popular in-context learning (ICL) approach for large language models (LLMs), especially when tackling complex reasoning tasks. Traditional ICL approaches construct prompts using examples that contain questions similar to the input question. However, CoT prompting, which includes crucial intermediate reasoning steps (rationales) within its examples, necessitates selecting examples based on these rationales rather than the questions themselves. Existing methods require human experts or pre-trained LLMs to describe the skill, a high-level abstraction of rationales, to guide the selection. These methods, however, are often costly and difficult to scale. Instead, this paper introduces a new approach named Latent Reasoning Skills (LaRS) that employs unsupervised learning to create a latent space representation of rationales, with a latent variable called a reasoning skill. Concurrently, LaRS learns a reasoning policy to determine the required reasoning skill for a given question. Then the ICL examples are selected by aligning the reasoning skills between past examples and the question. This approach is theoretically grounded and compute-efficient, eliminating the need for auxiliary LLM inference or manual prompt design. Empirical results demonstrate that LaRS consistently outperforms SOTA skill-based selection methods, processing example banks four times faster, reducing LLM inferences during the selection stage by half, and showing greater robustness to sub-optimal example banks.</description>

      <title>Alignment for Honesty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research has made significant strides in aligning large language models (LLMs) with helpfulness and harmlessness. In this paper, we argue for the importance of alignment for \emph{honesty}, ensuring that LLMs proactively refuse to answer questions when they lack knowledge, while still not being overly conservative. However, a pivotal aspect of alignment for honesty involves discerning an LLM's knowledge boundaries, which demands comprehensive solutions in terms of metric development, benchmark creation, and training methodologies. We address these challenges by first establishing a precise problem definition and defining ``honesty'' inspired by the Analects of Confucius. This serves as a cornerstone for developing metrics that effectively measure an LLM's honesty by quantifying its progress post-alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a flexible training framework which is further instantiated by several efficient fine-tuning techniques that emphasize honesty without sacrificing performance on other tasks. Our extensive experiments reveal that these aligned models show a marked increase in honesty, as indicated by our proposed metrics. We open-source all relevant resources to facilitate future research at \url{https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/alignment-for-honesty}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17122v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown their success in language understanding and reasoning on general topics. However, their capability to perform inference based on user-specified structured data and knowledge in corpus-rare concepts, such as causal decision-making is still limited. In this work, we explore the possibility of fine-tuning an open-sourced LLM into LLM4Causal, which can identify the causal task, execute a corresponding function, and interpret its numerical results based on users' queries and the provided dataset. Meanwhile, we propose a data generation process for more controllable GPT prompting and present two instruction-tuning datasets: (1) Causal-Retrieval-Bench for causal problem identification and input parameter extraction for causal function calling and (2) Causal-Interpret-Bench for in-context causal interpretation. By conducting end-to-end evaluations and two ablation studies, we showed that LLM4Causal can deliver end-to-end solutions for causal problems and provide easy-to-understand answers, which significantly outperforms the baselines.</description>

      <title>ConfusionPrompt: Practical Private Inference for Online Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are commonly deployed as online services, necessitating users to transmit informative prompts to cloud servers, thus engendering substantial privacy concerns. In response, we present ConfusionPrompt, a novel private LLM inference framework designed to obfuscate the server by: (i) decomposing the prompt into sub-prompts, and (ii) generating pseudo prompts along with the genuine sub-prompts as input to the online LLM. Eventually, the returned responses can be recomposed by the user to obtain the final whole response. Such designs endows our framework with advantages over previous protocols that (i) it can be seamlessly integrated with existing black-box LLMs, and (ii) it achieves significantly better privacy-utility trade-off than existing text perturbation-based methods. We develop a $(\lambda, \mu, \rho)$-privacy model to formulate the requirement for a privacy-preserving group of prompts, and provide a complexity analysis, affirming ConfusionPrompt's efficiency. Our empirical evaluation reveals that our method offers significantly higher utility compared to local inference methods using open-source models and perturbation-based techniques, while also requiring much less memory than open-source LLMs.</description>

      <title>Modular Learning of Deep Causal Generative Models for High-dimensional Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sound and complete algorithms have been proposed to compute identifiable causal queries using the causal structure and data. However, most of these algorithms assume accurate estimation of the data distribution, which is impractical for high-dimensional variables such as images. On the other hand, modern deep generative architectures can be trained to sample from high-dimensional distributions. However, training these networks are typically very costly. Thus, it is desirable to leverage pre-trained models to answer causal queries using such high-dimensional data. To address this, we propose modular training of deep causal generative models that not only makes learning more efficient, but also allows us to utilize large, pre-trained conditional generative models. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm, Modular-DCM is the first algorithm that, given the causal structure, uses adversarial training to learn the network weights, and can make use of pre-trained models to provably sample from any identifiable causal query in the presence of latent confounders. With extensive experiments on the Colored-MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the baselines. We also show our algorithm's convergence on the COVIDx dataset and its utility with a causal invariant prediction problem on CelebA-HQ.</description>

      <title>Attack-Resilient Image Watermarking Using Stable Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Watermarking images is critical for tracking image provenance and proving ownership. With the advent of generative models, such as stable diffusion, that can create fake but realistic images, watermarking has become particularly important to make human-created images reliably identifiable. Unfortunately, the very same stable diffusion technology can remove watermarks injected using existing methods. To address this problem, we present ZoDiac, which uses a pre-trained stable diffusion model to inject a watermark into the trainable latent space, resulting in watermarks that can be reliably detected in the latent vector even when attacked. We evaluate ZoDiac on three benchmarks, MS-COCO, DiffusionDB, and WikiArt, and find that ZoDiac is robust against state-of-the-art watermark attacks, with a watermark detection rate above 98% and a false positive rate below 6.4%, outperforming state-of-the-art watermarking methods. We hypothesize that the reciprocating denoising process in diffusion models may inherently enhance the robustness of the watermark when faced with strong attacks and validate the hypothesis. Our research demonstrates that stable diffusion is a promising approach to robust watermarking, able to withstand even stable-diffusion--based attack methods. ZoDiac is open-sourced and available at https://github.com/zhanglijun95/ZoDiac.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Framework with Spatio-Temporal Consistency Learning for Emergence Detection in Complex Adaptive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emergence, a global property of complex adaptive systems (CASs) constituted by interactive agents, is prevalent in real-world dynamic systems, e.g., network-level traffic congestions. Detecting its formation and evaporation helps to monitor the state of a system, allowing to issue a warning signal for harmful emergent phenomena. Since there is no centralized controller of CAS, detecting emergence based on each agent's local observation is desirable but challenging. Existing works are unable to capture emergence-related spatial patterns, and fail to model the nonlinear relationships among agents. This paper proposes a hierarchical framework with spatio-temporal consistency learning to solve these two problems by learning the system representation and agent representations, respectively. Spatio-temporal encoders composed of spatial and temporal transformers are designed to capture agents' nonlinear relationships and the system's complex evolution. Agents' and the system's representations are learned to preserve the spatio-temporal consistency by minimizing the spatial and temporal dissimilarities in a self-supervised manner in the latent space. Our method achieves more accurate detection than traditional methods and deep learning methods on three datasets with well-known yet hard-to-detect emergent behaviors. Notably, our hierarchical framework is generic in incorporating other deep learning methods for agent-level and system-level detection.</description>

Abstract: Adversarial examples arose as a challenge for machine learning. To hinder them, most defenses alter how models are trained (e.g., adversarial training) or inference is made (e.g., randomized smoothing). Still, while these approaches markedly improve models' adversarial robustness, models remain highly susceptible to adversarial examples. Identifying that, in certain domains such as traffic-sign recognition, objects are implemented per standards specifying how artifacts (e.g., signs) should be designed, we propose a novel approach for improving adversarial robustness. Specifically, we offer a method to redefine standards, making minor changes to existing ones, to defend against adversarial examples. We formulate the problem of artifact design as a robust optimization problem, and propose gradient-based and greedy search methods to solve it. We evaluated our approach in the domain of traffic-sign recognition, allowing it to alter traffic-sign pictograms (i.e., symbols within the signs) and their colors. We found that, combined with adversarial training, our approach led to up to 25.18\% higher robust accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods against two adversary types, while further increasing accuracy on benign inputs. Notably, a user study we conducted showed that traffic signs produced by our approach are also easily recognizable by human subjects.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Long-form Generations from Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To enhance Large Language Models' (LLMs) reliability, calibration is essential -- the model's assessed confidence scores should align with the actual likelihood of its responses being correct. However, current confidence elicitation methods and calibration metrics typically rely on a binary true/false assessment of response correctness. This approach does not apply to long-form generation, where an answer can be partially correct. Addressing this gap, we introduce a unified calibration framework, in which both the correctness of the LLMs' responses and their associated confidence levels are treated as distributions across a range of scores. Within this framework, we develop three metrics to precisely evaluate LLM calibration and further propose two confidence elicitation methods based on self-consistency and self-evaluation. Our experiments, which include long-form QA and summarization tasks, demonstrate that larger models don't necessarily guarantee better calibration, that calibration performance is found to be metric-dependent, and that self-consistency methods excel in factoid datasets. We also find that calibration can be enhanced through techniques such as fine-tuning, integrating relevant source documents, scaling the temperature, and combining self-consistency with self-evaluation. Lastly, we showcase a practical application of our system: selecting and cascading open-source models and ChatGPT to optimize correctness given a limited API budget. This research not only challenges existing notions of LLM calibration but also offers practical methodologies for improving trustworthiness in long-form generation.</description>

      <title>SimMLP: Training MLPs on Graphs without Supervision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in various graph learning tasks, yet their reliance on neighborhood aggregation during inference poses challenges for deployment in latency-sensitive applications, such as real-time financial fraud detection. To address this limitation, recent studies have proposed distilling knowledge from teacher GNNs into student Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on node content, aiming to accelerate inference. However, these approaches often inadequately explore structural information when inferring unseen nodes. To this end, we introduce SimMLP, a Self-supervised framework for learning MLPs on graphs, designed to fully integrate rich structural information into MLPs. Notably, SimMLP is the first MLP-learning method that can achieve equivalence to GNNs in the optimal case. The key idea is to employ self-supervised learning to align the representations encoded by graph context-aware GNNs and neighborhood dependency-free MLPs, thereby fully integrating the structural information into MLPs. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating the equivalence between SimMLP and GNNs based on mutual information and inductive bias, highlighting SimMLP's advanced structural learning capabilities. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets, covering node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, to showcase SimMLP's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios involving unseen nodes (e.g., inductive and cold-start node classification) where structural insights are crucial.

      <title>Recurrent Reinforcement Learning with Memoroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Memory models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers address Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) by mapping trajectories to latent Markov states. Neither model scales particularly well to long sequences, especially compared to an emerging class of memory models called Linear Recurrent Models. We discover that the recurrent update of these models resembles a monoid, leading us to reformulate existing models using a novel monoid-based framework that we call memoroids. We revisit the traditional approach to batching in recurrent reinforcement learning, highlighting theoretical and empirical deficiencies. We leverage memoroids to propose a batching method that improves sample efficiency, increases the return, and simplifies the implementation of recurrent loss functions in reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>LexC-Gen: Generating Data for Extremely Low-Resource Languages with Large Language Models and Bilingual Lexicons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data scarcity in low-resource languages can be addressed with word-to-word translations from labeled task data in high-resource languages using bilingual lexicons. However, bilingual lexicons often have limited lexical overlap with task data, which results in poor translation coverage and lexicon utilization. We propose lexicon-conditioned data generation LexC-Gen, a method that generates low-resource-language classification task data at scale. Specifically, LexC-Gen first uses high-resource-language words from bilingual lexicons to generate lexicon-compatible task data, and then it translates them into low-resource languages with bilingual lexicons via word translation. Across 17 extremely low-resource languages, LexC-Gen generated data is competitive with expert-translated gold data, and yields on average 5.6 and 8.9 points improvement over existing lexicon-based word translation methods on sentiment analysis and topic classification tasks respectively. Through ablation study, we show that conditioning on bilingual lexicons is the key component of LexC-Gen. LexC-Gen serves as a potential solution to close the performance gap between open-source multilingual models, such as BLOOMZ and Aya-101, and state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o on low-resource-language tasks.</description>

      <title>Watermarking Makes Language Models Radioactive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the radioactivity of text generated by large language models (LLM), i.e. whether it is possible to detect that such synthetic input was used to train a subsequent LLM. Current methods like membership inference or active IP protection either work only in settings where the suspected text is known or do not provide reliable statistical guarantees. We discover that, on the contrary, it is possible to reliably determine if a language model was trained on synthetic data if that data is output by a watermarked LLM. Our new methods, specialized for radioactivity, detects with a provable confidence weak residuals of the watermark signal in the fine-tuned LLM. We link the radioactivity contamination level to the following properties: the watermark robustness, its proportion in the training set, and the fine-tuning process. For instance, if the suspect model is open-weight, we demonstrate that training on watermarked instructions can be detected with high confidence ($p$-value $&lt; 10^{-5}$) even when as little as $5\%$ of training text is watermarked.</description>

      <title>RIME: Robust Preference-based Reinforcement Learning with Noisy Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17257v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) circumvents the need for reward engineering by harnessing human preferences as the reward signal. However, current PbRL methods excessively depend on high-quality feedback from domain experts, which results in a lack of robustness. In this paper, we present RIME, a robust PbRL algorithm for effective reward learning from noisy preferences. Our method utilizes a sample selection-based discriminator to dynamically filter out noise and ensure robust training. To counteract the cumulative error stemming from incorrect selection, we suggest a warm start for the reward model, which additionally bridges the performance gap during the transition from pre-training to online training in PbRL. Our experiments on robotic manipulation and locomotion tasks demonstrate that RIME significantly enhances the robustness of the state-of-the-art PbRL method. Code is available at https://github.com/CJReinforce/RIME_ICML2024.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Self-Supervised Learning for Scene Classification in Child Sexual Abuse Imagery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crime in the 21st century is split into a virtual and real world. However, the former has become a global menace to people's well-being and security in the latter. The challenges it presents must be faced with unified global cooperation, and we must rely more than ever on automated yet trustworthy tools to combat the ever-growing nature of online offenses. Over 10 million child sexual abuse reports are submitted to the US National Center for Missing \&amp; Exploited Children every year, and over 80% originate from online sources. Therefore, investigation centers cannot manually process and correctly investigate all imagery. In light of that, reliable automated tools that can securely and efficiently deal with this data are paramount. In this sense, the scene classification task looks for contextual cues in the environment, being able to group and classify child sexual abuse data without requiring to be trained on sensitive material. The scarcity and limitations of working with child sexual abuse images lead to self-supervised learning, a machine-learning methodology that leverages unlabeled data to produce powerful representations that can be more easily transferred to downstream tasks. This work shows that self-supervised deep learning models pre-trained on scene-centric data can reach 71.6% balanced accuracy on our indoor scene classification task and, on average, 2.2 percentage points better performance than a fully supervised version. We cooperate with Brazilian Federal Police experts to evaluate our indoor classification model on actual child abuse material. The results demonstrate a notable discrepancy between the features observed in widely used scene datasets and those depicted on sensitive materials.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness Assessment of Recent Large Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04306v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of large vision-language models (LVLMs) represents a remarkable advance in the quest for artificial general intelligence. However, the model's effectiveness in both specialized and general tasks warrants further investigation. This paper endeavors to evaluate the competency of popular LVLMs in specialized and general tasks, respectively, aiming to offer a comprehensive understanding of these novel models. To gauge their effectiveness in specialized tasks, we employ six challenging tasks in three different application scenarios: natural, healthcare, and industrial. These six tasks include salient/camouflaged/transparent object detection, as well as polyp detection, skin lesion detection, and industrial anomaly detection. We examine the performance of three recent open-source LVLMs, including MiniGPT-v2, LLaVA-1.5, and Shikra, on both visual recognition and localization in these tasks. Moreover, we conduct empirical investigations utilizing the aforementioned LVLMs together with GPT-4V, assessing their multi-modal understanding capabilities in general tasks including object counting, absurd question answering, affordance reasoning, attribute recognition, and spatial relation reasoning. Our investigations reveal that these LVLMs demonstrate limited proficiency not only in specialized tasks but also in general tasks. We delve deep into this inadequacy and uncover several potential factors, including limited cognition in specialized tasks, object hallucination, text-to-image interference, and decreased robustness in complex problems. We hope that this study can provide useful insights for the future development of LVLMs, helping researchers improve LVLMs for both general and specialized applications.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Text-to-Image Generative Models: An Empirical Study on Human Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an empirical study introducing a nuanced evaluation framework for text-to-image (T2I) generative models, applied to human image synthesis. Our framework categorizes evaluations into two distinct groups: first, focusing on image qualities such as aesthetics and realism, and second, examining text conditions through concept coverage and fairness. We introduce an innovative aesthetic score prediction model that assesses the visual appeal of generated images and unveils the first dataset marked with low-quality regions in generated human images to facilitate automatic defect detection. Our exploration into concept coverage probes the model's effectiveness in interpreting and rendering text-based concepts accurately, while our analysis of fairness reveals biases in model outputs, with an emphasis on gender, race, and age. While our study is grounded in human imagery, this dual-faceted approach is designed with the flexibility to be applicable to other forms of image generation, enhancing our understanding of generative models and paving the way to the next generation of more sophisticated, contextually aware, and ethically attuned generative models. Code and data, including the dataset annotated with defective areas, are available at \href{https://github.com/cure-lab/EvaluateAIGC}{https://github.com/cure-lab/EvaluateAIGC}.</description>

      <title>StreamingDialogue: Prolonged Dialogue Learning via Long Context Compression with Minimal Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with handling dialogues with long contexts due to efficiency and consistency issues. According to our observation, dialogue contexts are highly structured, and the special token of \textit{End-of-Utterance} (EoU) in dialogues has the potential to aggregate information. We refer to the EoU tokens as ``conversational attention sinks'' (conv-attn sinks). Accordingly, we introduce StreamingDialogue, which compresses long dialogue history into conv-attn sinks with minimal losses, and thus reduces computational complexity quadratically with the number of sinks (i.e., the number of utterances). Current LLMs already demonstrate the ability to handle long context window, e.g., a window size of 200K or more. To this end, by compressing utterances into EoUs, our method has the potential to handle more than 200K of utterances, resulting in a prolonged dialogue learning. In order to minimize information losses from reconstruction after compression, we design two learning strategies of short-memory reconstruction (SMR) and long-memory reactivation (LMR). Our method outperforms strong baselines in dialogue tasks and achieves a 4 $\times$ speedup while reducing memory usage by 18 $\times$ compared to dense attention recomputation.</description>

      <title>Veagle: Advancements in Multimodal Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lately, researchers in artificial intelligence have been really interested in how language and vision come together, giving rise to the development of multimodal models that aim to seamlessly integrate textual and visual information. Multimodal models, an extension of Large Language Models (LLMs), have exhibited remarkable capabilities in addressing a diverse array of tasks, ranging from image captioning and visual question answering (VQA) to visual grounding. While these models have showcased significant advancements, challenges persist in accurately interpreting images and answering the question, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the multimodal capabilities of existing models. In response to the limitations observed in current Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our proposed model Veagle, incorporates a unique mechanism inspired by the successes and insights of previous works. Veagle leverages a dynamic mechanism to project encoded visual information directly into the language model. This dynamic approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of intricate details present in visual contexts. To validate the effectiveness of Veagle, we conduct comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, emphasizing tasks such as visual question answering and image understanding. Our results indicate a improvement of 5-6 \% in performance, with Veagle outperforming existing models by a notable margin. The outcomes underscore the model's versatility and applicability beyond traditional benchmarks.</description>

      <title>RepairAgent: An Autonomous, LLM-Based Agent for Program Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated program repair has emerged as a powerful technique to mitigate the impact of software bugs on system reliability and user experience. This paper introduces RepairAgent, the first work to address the program repair challenge through an autonomous agent based on a large language model (LLM). Unlike existing deep learning-based approaches, which prompt a model with a fixed prompt or in a fixed feedback loop, our work treats the LLM as an agent capable of autonomously planning and executing actions to fix bugs by invoking suitable tools. RepairAgent freely interleaves gathering information about the bug, gathering repair ingredients, and validating fixes, while deciding which tools to invoke based on the gathered information and feedback from previous fix attempts. Key contributions that enable RepairAgent include a set of tools that are useful for program repair, a dynamically updated prompt format that allows the LLM to interact with these tools, and a finite state machine that guides the agent in invoking the tools. Our evaluation on the popular Defects4J dataset demonstrates RepairAgent's effectiveness in autonomously repairing 164 bugs, including 39 bugs not fixed by prior techniques. Interacting with the LLM imposes an average cost of 270,000 tokens per bug, which, under the current pricing of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, translates to 14 cents of USD per bug. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to present an autonomous, LLM-based agent for program repair, paving the way for future agent-based techniques in software engineering.</description>

      <title>Identity Decoupling for Multi-Subject Personalization of Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown remarkable success in generating personalized subjects based on a few reference images. However, current methods often fail when generating multiple subjects simultaneously, resulting in mixed identities with combined attributes from different subjects. In this work, we present MuDI, a novel framework that enables multi-subject personalization by effectively decoupling identities from multiple subjects. Our main idea is to utilize segmented subjects generated by a foundation model for segmentation (Segment Anything) for both training and inference, as a form of data augmentation for training and initialization for the generation process. Moreover, we further introduce a new metric to better evaluate the performance of our method on multi-subject personalization. Experimental results show that our MuDI can produce high-quality personalized images without identity mixing, even for highly similar subjects as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, in human evaluation, MuDI obtains twice the success rate for personalizing multiple subjects without identity mixing over existing baselines and is preferred over 70% against the strongest baseline.</description>

      <title>OneActor: Consistent Character Generation via Cluster-Conditioned Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10267v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models benefit artists with high-quality image generation. Yet their stochastic nature hinders artists from creating consistent images of the same subject. Existing methods try to tackle this challenge and generate consistent content in various ways. However, they either depend on external restricted data or require expensive tuning of the diffusion model. For this issue, we propose a novel one-shot tuning paradigm, termed OneActor. It efficiently performs consistent subject generation solely driven by prompts via a learned semantic guidance to bypass the laborious backbone tuning. We lead the way to formalize the objective of consistent subject generation from a clustering perspective, and thus design a cluster-conditioned model. To mitigate the overfitting challenge shared by one-shot tuning pipelines, we augment the tuning with auxiliary samples and devise two inference strategies: semantic interpolation and cluster guidance. These techniques are later verified to significantly improve the generation quality. Comprehensive experiments show that our method outperforms a variety of baselines with satisfactory subject consistency, superior prompt conformity as well as high image quality. Our method is capable of multi-subject generation and compatible with popular diffusion extensions. Besides, we achieve a 4 times faster tuning speed than tuning-based baselines and, if desired, avoid increasing the inference time. Furthermore, our method can be naturally utilized to pre-train a consistent subject generation network from scratch, which will implement this research task into more practical applications.

      <title>Digital Twin-Empowered Task Assignment in Aerial MEC Network: A Resource Coalition Cooperation Approach with Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01555v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To meet the demands for ubiquitous communication and temporary edge computing in 6G networks, aerial mobile edge computing (MEC) networks have been envisioned as a new paradigm. However, dynamic user requests pose challenges for task assignment strategies. Most of the existing research assumes that the strategy is deployed on ground-based stations or UAVs, which will be ineffective in an environment lacking infrastructure and continuous energy supply. Moreover, the resource mutual exclusion problem of dynamic task assignment has not been effectively solved. Toward this end, we introduce the digital twin (DT) into the aerial MEC network to study the resource coalition cooperation approach with the generative model (GM), which provides a preliminary coalition structure for the coalition game. Specifically, we propose a novel network framework that is composed of an application plane, a physical plane, and a virtual plane. After that, the task assignment problem is simplified to convex optimization programming with linear constraints. And then, we also propose a resource coalition cooperation approach that is based on a transferable utility (TU) coalition game to obtain an approximate optimal solution. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach in terms of energy consumption and utilization of resources.</description>

      <title>S-EQA: Tackling Situational Queries in Embodied Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and tackle the problem of Embodied Question Answering (EQA) with Situational Queries (S-EQA) in a household environment. Unlike prior EQA work tackling simple queries that directly reference target objects and properties ("What is the color of the car?"), situational queries (such as "Is the house ready for sleeptime?") are more challenging requiring the agent to identify multiple objects (Doors: Closed, Lights: Off, etc.) and reach a consensus on their states for an answer. Towards this objective, we first introduce a novel Prompt-Generate-Evaluate (PGE) scheme that wraps around an LLM's output to create a dataset of unique situational queries and corresponding consensus object information. PGE maintains uniqueness among the generated queries, using semantic similarity via a feedback loop. We annotate the generated data for ground truth answers via a large scale user-study conducted on M-Turk, and with a high answerability rate of 97.26%, establish that LLMs are good at generating situational data. However, using the same LLM to answer the queries gives a low success rate of 46.2%; indicating that while LLMs are good at generating query data, they are poor at answering them. We use images from the VirtualHome simulator with the S-EQA queries establish an evaluation benchmark via Visual Question Answering (VQA). We report an improved accuracy of 15.31% while using queries framed from the generated object consensus for VQA over directly answering situational ones, indicating that such simplification is necessary for improved performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce EQA in the context of situational queries that also uses a generative approach for query creation. We aim to foster research on improving the real-world usability of embodied agents in household environments through this work.</description>

      <title>Are EEG-to-Text Models Working?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06459v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work critically analyzes existing models for open-vocabulary EEG-to-Text translation. We identify a crucial limitation: previous studies often employed implicit teacher-forcing during evaluation, artificially inflating performance metrics. Additionally, they lacked a critical benchmark - comparing model performance on pure noise inputs. We propose a methodology to differentiate between models that truly learn from EEG signals and those that simply memorize training data. Our analysis reveals that model performance on noise data can be comparable to that on EEG data. These findings highlight the need for stricter evaluation practices in EEG-to-Text research, emphasizing transparent reporting and rigorous benchmarking with noise inputs. This approach will lead to more reliable assessments of model capabilities and pave the way for robust EEG-to-Text communication systems.

      <description>arXiv:2405.09529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article argues that AI can enhance the measurement and implementation of democratic processes within political parties, known as Intra-Party Democracy (IPD). It identifies the limitations of traditional methods for measuring IPD, which often rely on formal parameters, self-reported data, and tools like surveys. Such limitations lead to the collection of partial data, rare updates, and significant demands on resources. To address these issues, the article suggests that specific data management and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, such as natural language processing and sentiment analysis, can improve the measurement (ML about) and practice (ML for) of IPD. The article concludes by considering some of the principal risks of ML for IPD, including concerns over data privacy, the potential for manipulation, and the dangers of overreliance on technology.</description>

      <title>Understanding Sarcoidosis Using Large Language Models and Social Media Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sarcoidosis is a rare inflammatory disease characterized by the formation of granulomas in various organs. The disease presents diagnostic and treatment challenges due to its diverse manifestations and unpredictable nature. In this study, we employed a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze sarcoidosis-related discussions on the social media platform Reddit. Our findings underscore the efficacy of LLMs in accurately identifying sarcoidosis-related content. We discovered a wide array of symptoms reported by patients, with fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, and shortness of breath as the most prevalent. Prednisone was the most prescribed medication, while infliximab showed the highest effectiveness in improving prognoses. Notably, our analysis revealed disparities in prognosis based on age and gender, with women and younger patients experiencing good and polarized outcomes, respectively. Furthermore, unsupervised clustering identified three distinct patient subgroups (phenotypes) with unique symptom profiles, prognostic outcomes, and demographic distributions. Finally, sentiment analysis revealed a moderate negative impact on patients' mental health post-diagnosis, particularly among women and younger individuals. Our study represents the first application of LLMs to understand sarcoidosis through social media data. It contributes to understanding the disease by providing data-driven insights into its manifestations, treatments, prognoses, and impact on patients' lives. Our findings have direct implications for improving personalized treatment strategies and enhancing the quality of care for individuals living with sarcoidosis.</description>

      <title>Amplifying Aspect-Sentence Awareness: A Novel Approach for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is increasingly crucial in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for applications such as customer feedback analysis and product recommendation systems. ABSA goes beyond traditional sentiment analysis by extracting sentiments related to specific aspects mentioned in the text; existing attention-based models often need help to effectively connect aspects with context due to language complexity and multiple sentiment polarities in a single sentence. Recent research underscores the value of integrating syntactic information, such as dependency trees, to understand long-range syntactic relationships better and link aspects with context. Despite these advantages, challenges persist, including sensitivity to parsing errors and increased computational complexity when combining syntactic and semantic information. To address these issues, we propose Amplifying Aspect-Sentence Awareness (A3SN), a novel technique designed to enhance ABSA through amplifying aspect-sentence awareness attention. Following the transformer's standard process, our innovative approach incorporates multi-head attention mechanisms to augment the model with sentence and aspect semantic information. We added another multi-head attention module: amplify aspect-sentence awareness attention. By doubling its focus between the sentence and aspect, we effectively highlighted aspect importance within the sentence context. This enables accurate capture of subtle relationships and dependencies. Additionally, gated fusion integrates feature representations from multi-head and amplified aspect-sentence awareness attention mechanisms, which is essential for ABSA. Experimental results across three benchmark datasets demonstrate A3SN's effectiveness and outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline models.</description>

      <title>Vikhr: Constructing a State-of-the-art Bilingual Open-Source Instruction-Following Large Language Model for Russia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a surge in developing various Large Language Models (LLMs). However, text generation for languages other than English often faces significant challenges, including poor generation quality and reduced computational performance due to the disproportionate representation of tokens in the model's vocabulary. In this work, we address these issues by developing a pipeline for adapting English-oriented pre-trained models to other languages and constructing efficient bilingual LLMs. Using this pipeline, we construct Vikhr, a state-of-the-art bilingual open-source instruction-following LLM designed specifically for the Russian language. "Vikhr" refers to the name of the Mistral LLM series and means a "strong gust of wind." Unlike previous Russian-language models that typically rely on LoRA adapters on top of English-oriented models, sacrificing performance for lower training costs, Vikhr features an adapted tokenizer vocabulary and undergoes continued pre-training and instruction tuning of all weights. This not only enhances the model's performance but also significantly improves its computational and contextual efficiency. The remarkable performance of Vikhr across various Russian-language benchmarks can also be attributed to our efforts in expanding instruction datasets and corpora for continued pre-training. Vikhr not only sets a new state of the art among open-source LLMs for Russian but even outperforms some proprietary closed-source models on certain benchmarks. The model weights, instruction sets, and code are publicly available.</description>

      <title>RadarOcc: Robust 3D Occupancy Prediction with 4D Imaging Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14014v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D occupancy-based perception pipeline has significantly advanced autonomous driving by capturing detailed scene descriptions and demonstrating strong generalizability across various object categories and shapes. Current methods predominantly rely on LiDAR or camera inputs for 3D occupancy prediction. These methods are susceptible to adverse weather conditions, limiting the all-weather deployment of self-driving cars. To improve perception robustness, we leverage the recent advances in automotive radars and introduce a novel approach that utilizes 4D imaging radar sensors for 3D occupancy prediction. Our method, RadarOcc, circumvents the limitations of sparse radar point clouds by directly processing the 4D radar tensor, thus preserving essential scene details. RadarOcc innovatively addresses the challenges associated with the voluminous and noisy 4D radar data by employing Doppler bins descriptors, sidelobe-aware spatial sparsification, and range-wise self-attention mechanisms. To minimize the interpolation errors associated with direct coordinate transformations, we also devise a spherical-based feature encoding followed by spherical-to-Cartesian feature aggregation. We benchmark various baseline methods based on distinct modalities on the public K-Radar dataset. The results demonstrate RadarOcc's state-of-the-art performance in radar-based 3D occupancy prediction and promising results even when compared with LiDAR- or camera-based methods. Additionally, we present qualitative evidence of the superior performance of 4D radar in adverse weather conditions and explore the impact of key pipeline components through ablation studies.</description>

      <title>SpGesture: Source-Free Domain-adaptive sEMG-based Gesture Recognition with Jaccard Attentive Spiking Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) based gesture recognition offers a natural and intuitive interaction modality for wearable devices. Despite significant advancements in sEMG-based gesture-recognition models, existing methods often suffer from high computational latency and increased energy consumption. Additionally, the inherent instability of sEMG signals, combined with their sensitivity to distribution shifts in real-world settings, compromises model robustness. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel SpGesture framework based on Spiking Neural Networks, which possesses several unique merits compared with existing methods: (1) Robustness: By utilizing membrane potential as a memory list, we pioneer the introduction of Source-Free Domain Adaptation into SNN for the first time. This enables SpGesture to mitigate the accuracy degradation caused by distribution shifts. (2) High Accuracy: With a novel Spiking Jaccard Attention, SpGesture enhances the SNNs' ability to represent sEMG features, leading to a notable rise in system accuracy. To validate SpGesture's performance, we collected a new sEMG gesture dataset which has different forearm postures, where SpGesture achieved the highest accuracy among the baselines ($89.26\%$). Moreover, the actual deployment on the CPU demonstrated a system latency below 100ms, well within real-time requirements. This impressive performance showcases SpGesture's potential to enhance the applicability of sEMG in real-world scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/guoweiyu/SpGesture/.</description>

      <title>RFLPA: A Robust Federated Learning Framework against Poisoning Attacks with Secure Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple devices to train a model collaboratively without sharing their data. Despite its benefits, FL is vulnerable to privacy leakage and poisoning attacks. To address the privacy concern, secure aggregation (SecAgg) is often used to obtain the aggregation of gradients on sever without inspecting individual user updates. Unfortunately, existing defense strategies against poisoning attacks rely on the analysis of local updates in plaintext, making them incompatible with SecAgg. To reconcile the conflicts, we propose a robust federated learning framework against poisoning attacks (RFLPA) based on SecAgg protocol. Our framework computes the cosine similarity between local updates and server updates to conduct robust aggregation. Furthermore, we leverage verifiable packed Shamir secret sharing to achieve reduced communication cost of $O(M+N)$ per user, and design a novel dot product aggregation algorithm to resolve the issue of increased information leakage. Our experimental results show that RFLPA significantly reduces communication and computation overhead by over $75\%$ compared to the state-of-the-art secret sharing method, BREA, while maintaining competitive accuracy.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Feature Diversity Boosts Channel-Adaptive Vision Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-Channel Imaging (MCI) contains an array of challenges for encoding useful feature representations not present in traditional images. For example, images from two different satellites may both contain RGB channels, but the remaining channels can be different for each imaging source. Thus, MCI models must support a variety of channel configurations at test time. Recent work has extended traditional visual encoders for MCI, such as Vision Transformers (ViT), by supplementing pixel information with an encoding representing the channel configuration. However, these methods treat each channel equally, i.e., they do not consider the unique properties of each channel type, which can result in needless and potentially harmful redundancies in the learned features. For example, if RGB channels are always present, the other channels can focus on extracting information that cannot be captured by the RGB channels. To this end, we propose DiChaViT, which aims to enhance the diversity in the learned features of MCI-ViT models. This is achieved through a novel channel sampling strategy that encourages the selection of more distinct channel sets for training. Additionally, we employ regularization and initialization techniques to increase the likelihood that new information is learned from each channel. Many of our improvements are architecture agnostic and can be incorporated into new architectures as they are developed. Experiments on both satellite and cell microscopy datasets, CHAMMI, JUMP-CP, and So2Sat, report DiChaViT yields a 1.5 - 5.0% gain over the state-of-the-art.

      <title>Looks Too Good To Be True: An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Hallucinations in Generative Restoration Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of high perceptual quality in image restoration has driven the development of revolutionary generative models, capable of producing results often visually indistinguishable from real data. However, as their perceptual quality continues to improve, these models also exhibit a growing tendency to generate hallucinations - realistic-looking details that do not exist in the ground truth images. Hallucinations in these models create uncertainty about their reliability, raising major concerns about their practical application. This paper investigates this phenomenon through the lens of information theory, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between uncertainty and perception. We rigorously analyze the relationship between these two factors, proving that the global minimal uncertainty in generative models grows in tandem with perception. In particular, we define the inherent uncertainty of the restoration problem and show that attaining perfect perceptual quality entails at least twice this uncertainty. Additionally, we establish a relation between distortion, uncertainty and perception, through which we prove the aforementioned uncertainly-perception tradeoff induces the well-known perception-distortion tradeoff. We demonstrate our theoretical findings through experiments with super-resolution and inpainting algorithms. This work uncovers fundamental limitations of generative models in achieving both high perceptual quality and reliable predictions for image restoration. Thus, we aim to raise awareness among practitioners about this inherent tradeoff, empowering them to make informed decisions and potentially prioritize safety over perceptual performance.</description>

      <title>Vista: A Generalizable Driving World Model with High Fidelity and Versatile Controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17398v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: World models can foresee the outcomes of different actions, which is of paramount importance for autonomous driving. Nevertheless, existing driving world models still have limitations in generalization to unseen environments, prediction fidelity of critical details, and action controllability for flexible application. In this paper, we present Vista, a generalizable driving world model with high fidelity and versatile controllability. Based on a systematic diagnosis of existing methods, we introduce several key ingredients to address these limitations. To accurately predict real-world dynamics at high resolution, we propose two novel losses to promote the learning of moving instances and structural information. We also devise an effective latent replacement approach to inject historical frames as priors for coherent long-horizon rollouts. For action controllability, we incorporate a versatile set of controls from high-level intentions (command, goal point) to low-level maneuvers (trajectory, angle, and speed) through an efficient learning strategy. After large-scale training, the capabilities of Vista can seamlessly generalize to different scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that Vista outperforms the most advanced general-purpose video generator in over 70% of comparisons and surpasses the best-performing driving world model by 55% in FID and 27% in FVD. Moreover, for the first time, we utilize the capacity of Vista itself to establish a generalizable reward for real-world action evaluation without accessing the ground truth actions.</description>

      <title>MultiOOD: Scaling Out-of-Distribution Detection for Multiple Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is important for deploying machine learning models in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and robot-assisted surgery. Existing research has mainly focused on unimodal scenarios on image data. However, real-world applications are inherently multimodal, which makes it essential to leverage information from multiple modalities to enhance the efficacy of OOD detection. To establish a foundation for more realistic Multimodal OOD Detection, we introduce the first-of-its-kind benchmark, MultiOOD, characterized by diverse dataset sizes and varying modality combinations. We first evaluate existing unimodal OOD detection algorithms on MultiOOD, observing that the mere inclusion of additional modalities yields substantial improvements. This underscores the importance of utilizing multiple modalities for OOD detection. Based on the observation of Modality Prediction Discrepancy between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data, and its strong correlation with OOD performance, we propose the Agree-to-Disagree (A2D) algorithm to encourage such discrepancy during training. Moreover, we introduce a novel outlier synthesis method, NP-Mix, which explores broader feature spaces by leveraging the information from nearest neighbor classes and complements A2D to strengthen OOD detection performance. Extensive experiments on MultiOOD demonstrate that training with A2D and NP-Mix improves existing OOD detection algorithms by a large margin. Our source code and MultiOOD benchmark are available at https://github.com/donghao51/MultiOOD.</description>

      <title>FASTopic: Pretrained Transformer is a Fast, Adaptive, Stable, and Transferable Topic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topic models have been evolving rapidly over the years, from conventional to recent neural models. However, existing topic models generally struggle with either effectiveness, efficiency, or stability, highly impeding their practical applications. In this paper, we propose FASTopic, a fast, adaptive, stable, and transferable topic model. FASTopic follows a new paradigm: Dual Semantic-relation Reconstruction (DSR). Instead of previous conventional, VAE-based, or clustering-based methods, DSR directly models the semantic relations among document embeddings from a pretrained Transformer and learnable topic and word embeddings. By reconstructing through these semantic relations, DSR discovers latent topics. This brings about a neat and efficient topic modeling framework. We further propose a novel Embedding Transport Plan (ETP) method. Rather than early straightforward approaches, ETP explicitly regularizes the semantic relations as optimal transport plans. This addresses the relation bias issue and thus leads to effective topic modeling. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our FASTopic shows superior effectiveness, efficiency, adaptivity, stability, and transferability, compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various scenarios.</description>

      <title>4-bit Shampoo for Memory-Efficient Network Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Second-order optimizers, maintaining a matrix termed a preconditioner, are superior to first-order optimizers in both theory and practice. The states forming the preconditioner and its inverse root restrict the maximum size of models trained by second-order optimizers. To address this, compressing 32-bit optimizer states to lower bitwidths has shown promise in reducing memory usage. However, current approaches only pertain to first-order optimizers. In this paper, we propose the first 4-bit second-order optimizers, exemplified by 4-bit Shampoo, maintaining performance similar to that of 32-bit ones. We show that quantizing the eigenvector matrix of the preconditioner in 4-bit Shampoo is remarkably better than quantizing the preconditioner itself both theoretically and experimentally. By rectifying the orthogonality of the quantized eigenvector matrix, we enhance the approximation of the preconditioner's eigenvector matrix, which also benefits the computation of its inverse 4-th root. Besides, we find that linear square quantization slightly outperforms dynamic tree quantization when quantizing second-order optimizer states. Evaluation on various networks for image classification and natural language modeling demonstrates that our 4-bit Shampoo achieves comparable performance to its 32-bit counterpart while being more memory-efficient.</description>

      <title>Segment, Shuffle, and Stitch: A Simple Layer for Improving Time-Series Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing approaches for learning representations of time-series keep the temporal arrangement of the time-steps intact with the presumption that the original order is the most optimal for learning. However, non-adjacent sections of real-world time-series may have strong dependencies. Accordingly, we raise the question: Is there an alternative arrangement for time-series which could enable more effective representation learning? To address this, we propose a simple plug-and-play neural network layer called Segment, Shuffle, and Stitch (S3) designed to improve representation learning by time-series models. S3 works by creating non-overlapping segments from the original sequence and shuffling them in a learned manner that is optimal for the task at hand. It then re-attaches the shuffled segments back together and performs a learned weighted sum with the original input to capture both the newly shuffled sequence along with the original sequence. S3 is modular and can be stacked to achieve different levels of granularity, and can be added to many forms of neural architectures including CNNs or Transformers with negligible computation overhead. Through extensive experiments on several datasets and state-of-the-art baselines, we show that incorporating S3 results in significant improvements for the tasks of time-series classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection, improving performance on certain datasets by up to 68\%. We also show that S3 makes the learning more stable with a smoother training loss curve and loss landscape compared to the original baseline. The code is available at https://github.com/shivam-grover/S3-TimeSeries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for training large language models (LLMs) to adhere to objectives defined within a latent embedding space. Our method leverages reinforcement learning (RL), treating a pre-trained LLM as an environment. Our embedding-aligned guided language (EAGLE) agent is trained to iteratively steer the LLM's generation towards optimal regions of the latent embedding space, w.r.t. some predefined criterion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the EAGLE agent using the MovieLens 25M and Amazon Review datasets to surface content gaps that satisfy latent user demand. We also demonstrate the benefit of using an optimal design of a state-dependent action set to improve EAGLE's efficiency. Our work paves the way for controlled and grounded text generation using LLMs, ensuring consistency with domain-specific knowledge and data representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning is known to improve Large Language Models both empirically and in terms of theoretical approximation power. However, our understanding of the inner workings and conditions of apparition of CoT capabilities remains limited. This paper helps fill this gap by demonstrating how CoT reasoning emerges in transformers in a controlled and interpretable setting. In particular, we observe the appearance of a specialized attention mechanism dedicated to iterative reasoning, which we coined "iteration heads". We track both the emergence and the precise working of these iteration heads down to the attention level, and measure the transferability of the CoT skills to which they give rise between tasks.</description>

      <title>Finding NeMo: Localizing Neurons Responsible For Memorization in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) produce very detailed and high-quality images. Their power results from extensive training on large amounts of data, usually scraped from the internet without proper attribution or consent from content creators. Unfortunately, this practice raises privacy and intellectual property concerns, as DMs can memorize and later reproduce their potentially sensitive or copyrighted training images at inference time. Prior efforts prevent this issue by either changing the input to the diffusion process, thereby preventing the DM from generating memorized samples during inference, or removing the memorized data from training altogether. While those are viable solutions when the DM is developed and deployed in a secure and constantly monitored environment, they hold the risk of adversaries circumventing the safeguards and are not effective when the DM itself is publicly released. To solve the problem, we introduce NeMo, the first method to localize memorization of individual data samples down to the level of neurons in DMs' cross-attention layers. Through our experiments, we make the intriguing finding that in many cases, single neurons are responsible for memorizing particular training samples. By deactivating these memorization neurons, we can avoid the replication of training data at inference time, increase the diversity in the generated outputs, and mitigate the leakage of private and copyrighted data. In this way, our NeMo contributes to a more responsible deployment of DMs.</description>

      <title>HYDRA: Model Factorization Framework for Black-Box LLM Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02888v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalization has emerged as a critical research area in modern intelligent systems, focusing on mining users' behavioral history and adapting to their preferences for delivering tailored experiences. Despite the remarkable few-shot capabilities exhibited by black-box large language models (LLMs), the inherent opacity of their model parameters presents significant challenges in aligning the generated output with individual expectations. Existing solutions have primarily focused on prompt design to incorporate user-specific profiles and behaviors; however, such approaches often struggle to generalize effectively due to their inability to capture shared knowledge among all users. To address these challenges, we propose HYDRA, a model factorization framework that captures both user-specific behavior patterns from historical data and shared general knowledge among all users to deliver personalized generation. In order to capture user-specific behavior patterns, we first train a reranker to prioritize the most useful information from top-retrieved relevant historical records. By combining the prioritized history with the corresponding query, we train an adapter to align the output with individual user-specific preferences, eliminating the reliance on access to inherent model parameters of black-box LLMs. Both the reranker and the adapter can be decomposed into a base model with multiple user-specific heads, resembling a hydra. The base model maintains shared knowledge across users, while the multiple personal heads capture user-specific preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that HYDRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art prompt-based methods by an average relative improvement of 9.01% across five diverse personalization tasks in the LaMP benchmark. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/night-chen/HYDRA.</description>

      <title>Better Late Than Never: Formulating and Benchmarking Recommendation Editing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommendation systems play a pivotal role in suggesting items to users based on their preferences. However, in online platforms, these systems inevitably offer unsuitable recommendations due to limited model capacity, poor data quality, or evolving user interests. Enhancing user experience necessitates efficiently rectify such unsuitable recommendation behaviors. This paper introduces a novel and significant task termed recommendation editing, which focuses on modifying known and unsuitable recommendation behaviors. Specifically, this task aims to adjust the recommendation model to eliminate known unsuitable items without accessing training data or retraining the model. We formally define the problem of recommendation editing with three primary objectives: strict rectification, collaborative rectification, and concentrated rectification. Three evaluation metrics are developed to quantitatively assess the achievement of each objective. We present a straightforward yet effective benchmark for recommendation editing using novel Editing Bayesian Personalized Ranking Loss. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we establish a comprehensive benchmark that incorporates various methods from related fields. Codebase is available at https://github.com/cycl2018/Recommendation-Editing.</description>

      <title>CorDA: Context-Oriented Decomposition Adaptation of Large Language Models for Task-Aware Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods build adapters widely agnostic of the context of downstream task to learn, or the context of important knowledge to maintain. As a result, there is often a performance gap compared to full-parameter fine-tuning, and meanwhile the fine-tuned model suffers from catastrophic forgetting of the pre-trained world knowledge. In this paper, we propose CorDA, a Context-oriented Decomposition Adaptation method that builds learnable task-aware adapters from weight decomposition oriented by the context of downstream task or the world knowledge to maintain. Concretely, we collect a few data samples, and perform singular value decomposition for each linear layer of a pre-trained LLM multiplied by the covariance matrix of the input activation using these samples. The inverse of the covariance matrix is multiplied with the decomposed components to reconstruct the original weights. By doing so, the context of the representative samples is captured through deciding the factorizing orientation. Our method enables two options, the knowledge-preserved adaptation and the instruction-previewed adaptation. For the former, we use question-answering samples to obtain the covariance matrices, and use the decomposed components with the smallest $r$ singular values to initialize a learnable adapter, with the others frozen such that the world knowledge is better preserved. For the latter, we use the instruction data from the fine-tuning task, such as math or coding, to orientate the decomposition and train the largest $r$ components that most correspond to the task to learn. We conduct extensive experiments on Math, Code, and Instruction Following tasks.</description>

      <title>MSAGPT: Neural Prompting Protein Structure Prediction via MSA Generative Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) plays a pivotal role in unveiling the evolutionary trajectories of protein families. The accuracy of protein structure predictions is often compromised for protein sequences that lack sufficient homologous information to construct high quality MSA. Although various methods have been proposed to generate virtual MSA under these conditions, they fall short in comprehensively capturing the intricate coevolutionary patterns within MSA or require guidance from external oracle models. Here we introduce MSAGPT, a novel approach to prompt protein structure predictions via MSA generative pretraining in the low MSA regime. MSAGPT employs a simple yet effective 2D evolutionary positional encoding scheme to model complex evolutionary patterns. Endowed by this, its flexible 1D MSA decoding framework facilitates zero or few shot learning. Moreover, we demonstrate that leveraging the feedback from AlphaFold2 can further enhance the model capacity via Rejective Fine tuning (RFT) and Reinforcement Learning from AF2 Feedback (RLAF). Extensive experiments confirm the efficacy of MSAGPT in generating faithful virtual MSA to enhance the structure prediction accuracy. The transfer learning capabilities also highlight its great potential for facilitating other protein tasks.</description>

Abstract: Existing prompt-tuning methods have demonstrated impressive performances in continual learning (CL), by selecting and updating relevant prompts in the vision-transformer models. On the contrary, this paper aims to learn each task by tuning the prompts in the direction orthogonal to the subspace spanned by previous tasks' features, so as to ensure no interference on tasks that have been learned to overcome catastrophic forgetting in CL. However, different from the orthogonal projection in the traditional CNN architecture, the prompt gradient orthogonal projection in the ViT architecture shows completely different and greater challenges, i.e., 1) the high-order and non-linear self-attention operation; 2) the drift of prompt distribution brought by the LayerNorm in the transformer block. Theoretically, we have finally deduced two consistency conditions to achieve the prompt gradient orthogonal projection, which provide a theoretical guarantee of eliminating interference on previously learned knowledge via the self-attention mechanism in visual prompt tuning. In practice, an effective null-space-based approximation solution has been proposed to implement the prompt gradient orthogonal projection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of anti-forgetting on four class-incremental benchmarks with diverse pre-trained baseline models, and our approach achieves superior performances to state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Speaking Your Language: Spatial Relationships in Interpretable Emergent Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective communication requires the ability to refer to specific parts of an observation in relation to others. While emergent communication literature shows success in developing various language properties, no research has shown the emergence of such positional references. This paper demonstrates how agents can communicate about spatial relationships within their observations. The results indicate that agents can develop a language capable of expressing the relationships between parts of their observation, achieving over 90% accuracy when trained in a referential game which requires such communication. Using a collocation measure, we demonstrate how the agents create such references. This analysis suggests that agents use a mixture of non-compositional and compositional messages to convey spatial relationships. We also show that the emergent language is interpretable by humans. The translation accuracy is tested by communicating with the receiver agent, where the receiver achieves over 78% accuracy using parts of this lexicon, confirming that the interpretation of the emergent language was successful.</description>

      <title>GemNet: Menu-Based, Strategy-Proof Multi-Bidder Auctions Through Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated mechanism design (AMD) uses computational methods for mechanism design. Differentiable economics is a form of AMD that uses deep learning to learn mechanism designs and has enabled strong progress in AMD in recent years. Nevertheless, a major open problem has been to learn multi-bidder, general, and fully strategy-proof (SP) auctions. We introduce GEneral Menu-based NETwork (GemNet), which significantly extends the menu-based approach of the single-bidder RochetNet (D\"utting et al., 2024) to the multi-bidder setting. The challenge in achieving SP is to learn bidder-independent menus that are feasible, so that the optimal menu choices for each bidder do not over-allocate items when taken together (we call this menu compatibility). GemNet penalizes the failure of menu compatibility during training, and transforms learned menus after training through price changes, by considering a set of discretized bidder values and reasoning about Lipschitz smoothness to guarantee menu compatibility on the entire value space. This approach is general, leaving trained menus that already satisfy menu compatibility undisturbed and reducing to RochetNet for a single bidder. Mixed-integer linear programs are used for menu transforms, and through a number of optimizations enabled by deep learning, including adaptive grids and methods to skip menu elements, we scale to large auction design problems. GemNet learns auctions with better revenue than affine maximization methods, achieves exact SP whereas previous general multi-bidder methods are approximately SP, and offers greatly enhanced interpretability.</description>

      <title>ME-Switch: A Memory-Efficient Expert Switching Framework for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM development involves pre-training a foundation model on massive data, followed by fine-tuning on task-specific data to create specialized experts. Serving these experts can pose significant memory challenges, as loading all experts onto devices is impractical, and frequent switching between experts in response to user requests can incur substantial I/O costs. Previous approaches decompose the expert weights as the pre-trained weights plus delta weights, followed by quantizing the delta weights using output channel-wise step sizes to reduce the model size. However, these methods overlook the fact that certain input channels of delta weights can cause significant quantization errors at extremely low bitwidths. Additionally, existing methods assume that the appropriate model for a user request is known in advance, which is not the case in practice. To this end, we introduce ME-Switch, a memory-efficient expert switching framework tailored for serving multiple LLMs. To condense the number of bits required for describing the delta weights, we propose a salient-aware delta compression method that identifies salient input channels based on reconstruction error and applies mixed-precision quantization, reducing non-salient channels to low bits while keeping salient ones intact, cutting storage demand without compromising performance. Moreover, we develop a model-level routing method that efficiently directs user queries to the most suitable expert by performing domain classification. Extensive experiments show the promising memory efficiency and routing performance of ME-Switch. For example, when serving three models from the Mistral-7B family, ME-Switch reduces the model size by $1.74\times$ and maintains nearly lossless performance on instruction, mathematical reasoning, and code generation tasks. Notably, our method can efficiently serve 16 Mistral-7B models on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.</description>

      <title>SeTAR: Out-of-Distribution Detection with Selective Low-Rank Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the safe deployment of neural networks. Existing CLIP-based approaches perform OOD detection by devising novel scoring functions or sophisticated fine-tuning methods. In this work, we propose SeTAR, a novel, training-free OOD detection method that leverages selective low-rank approximation of weight matrices in vision-language and vision-only models. SeTAR enhances OOD detection via post-hoc modification of the model's weight matrices using a simple greedy search algorithm. Based on SeTAR, we further propose SeTAR+FT, a fine-tuning extension optimizing model performance for OOD detection tasks. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet1K and Pascal-VOC benchmarks show SeTAR's superior performance, reducing the relatively false positive rate by up to 18.95% and 36.80% compared to zero-shot and fine-tuning baselines. Ablation studies further validate SeTAR's effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability across different model backbones. Our work offers a scalable, efficient solution for OOD detection, setting a new state-of-the-art in this area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the landscape of generative artificial intelligence, diffusion-based models have emerged as a promising method for generating synthetic images. However, the application of diffusion models poses numerous challenges, particularly concerning data availability, computational requirements, and privacy. Traditional approaches to address these shortcomings, like federated learning, often impose significant computational burdens on individual clients, especially those with constrained resources. In response to these challenges, we introduce a novel approach for distributed collaborative diffusion models inspired by split learning. Our approach facilitates collaborative training of diffusion models while alleviating client computational burdens during image synthesis. This reduced computational burden is achieved by retaining data and computationally inexpensive processes locally at each client while outsourcing the computationally expensive processes to shared, more efficient server resources. Through experiments on the common CelebA dataset, our approach demonstrates enhanced privacy by reducing the necessity for sharing raw data. These capabilities hold significant potential across various application areas, including the design of edge computing solutions. Thus, our work advances distributed machine learning by contributing to the evolution of collaborative diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Towards Open Respiratory Acoustic Foundation Models: Pretraining and Benchmarking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Respiratory audio, such as coughing and breathing sounds, has predictive power for a wide range of healthcare applications, yet is currently under-explored. The main problem for those applications arises from the difficulty in collecting large labeled task-specific data for model development. Generalizable respiratory acoustic foundation models pretrained with unlabeled data would offer appealing advantages and possibly unlock this impasse. However, given the safety-critical nature of healthcare applications, it is pivotal to also ensure openness and replicability for any proposed foundation model solution. To this end, we introduce OPERA, an OPEn Respiratory Acoustic foundation model pretraining and benchmarking system, as the first approach answering this need. We curate large-scale respiratory audio datasets (~136K samples, over 400 hours), pretrain three pioneering foundation models, and build a benchmark consisting of 19 downstream respiratory health tasks for evaluation. Our pretrained models demonstrate superior performance (against existing acoustic models pretrained with general audio on 16 out of 19 tasks) and generalizability (to unseen datasets and new respiratory audio modalities). This highlights the great promise of respiratory acoustic foundation models and encourages more studies using OPERA as an open resource to accelerate research on respiratory audio for health. The system is accessible from https://github.com/evelyn0414/OPERA.</description>

      <title>Are Language Models Actually Useful for Time Series Forecasting?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being applied to time series forecasting. But are language models actually useful for time series? In a series of ablation studies on three recent and popular LLM-based time series forecasting methods, we find that removing the LLM component or replacing it with a basic attention layer does not degrade forecasting performance -- in most cases, the results even improve! We also find that despite their significant computational cost, pretrained LLMs do no better than models trained from scratch, do not represent the sequential dependencies in time series, and do not assist in few-shot settings. Additionally, we explore time series encoders and find that patching and attention structures perform similarly to LLM-based forecasters.</description>

      <title>GraphPipe: Improving Performance and Scalability of DNN Training with Graph Pipeline Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) continue to grow rapidly in size, making them infeasible to train on a single device. Pipeline parallelism is commonly used in existing DNN systems to support large-scale DNN training by partitioning a DNN into multiple stages, which concurrently perform DNN training for different micro-batches in a pipeline fashion. However, existing pipeline-parallel approaches only consider sequential pipeline stages and thus ignore the topology of a DNN, resulting in missed model-parallel opportunities. This paper presents graph pipeline parallelism (GPP), a new pipeline-parallel scheme that partitions a DNN into pipeline stages whose dependencies are identified by a directed acyclic graph. GPP generalizes existing sequential pipeline parallelism and preserves the inherent topology of a DNN to enable concurrent execution of computationally-independent operators, resulting in reduced memory requirement and improved GPU performance. In addition, we develop GraphPipe, a distributed system that exploits GPP strategies to enable performant and scalable DNN training. GraphPipe partitions a DNN into a graph of stages, optimizes micro-batch schedules for these stages, and parallelizes DNN training using the discovered GPP strategies. Evaluation on a variety of DNNs shows that GraphPipe outperforms existing pipeline-parallel systems such as PipeDream and Piper by up to 1.6X. GraphPipe also reduces the search time by 9-21X compared to PipeDream and Piper.</description>

      <title>Layer-Wise Quantization: A Pragmatic and Effective Method for Quantizing LLMs Beyond Integer Bit-Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17415v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple meta quantization approach that quantizes different layers of a large language model (LLM) at different bit levels, and is independent of the underlying quantization technique. Specifically, we quantize the most important layers to higher bit precision and less important layers to lower bits. We propose two effective strategies to measure the importance of layers within LLMs: the first measures the importance of a layer based on how different its output embeddings are from the input embeddings (higher is better); the second estimates the importance of a layer using the number of layer weights that are much larger than average (smaller is better). We show that quantizing different layers at varying bits according to our importance scores results in minimal performance drop with a far more compressed model size. Finally, we present several practical key takeaways from our variable layer-wise quantization experiments: (a) LLM performance under variable quantization remains close to the original model until 25-50% of layers are moved in lower quantization using our proposed ordering but only until 5-10% if moved using no specific ordering; (b) Adding layer importance to inherently dynamic quantization techniques can further improve their performance, showing that our approach is complementary to other dynamic quantization methods; (c) Quantizing LLMs to lower bits performs substantially better than pruning unless extreme quantization (2-bit) is used; and (d) Layer-wise quantization to lower bits works better in the case of larger LLMs with more layers compared to smaller LLMs with fewer layers. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/RazvanDu/LayerwiseQuant/.</description>

      <title>Galaxy spectroscopy without spectra: Galaxy properties from photometric images with conditional diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern spectroscopic surveys can only target a small fraction of the vast amount of photometrically cataloged sources in wide-field surveys. Here, we report the development of a generative AI method capable of predicting optical galaxy spectra from photometric broad-band images alone. This method draws from the latest advances in diffusion models in combination with contrastive networks. We pass multi-band galaxy images into the architecture to obtain optical spectra. From these, robust values for galaxy properties can be derived with any methods in the spectroscopic toolbox, such as standard population synthesis techniques and Lick indices. When trained and tested on 64x64-pixel images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the global bimodality of star-forming and quiescent galaxies in photometric space is recovered, as well as a mass-metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies. The comparison between the observed and the artificially created spectra shows good agreement in overall metallicity, age, Dn4000, stellar velocity dispersion, and E(B-V) values. Photometric redshift estimates of our generative algorithm can compete with other current, specialized deep-learning techniques. Moreover, this work is the first attempt in the literature to infer velocity dispersion from photometric images. Additionally, we can predict the presence of an active galactic nucleus up to an accuracy of 82%. With our method, scientifically interesting galaxy properties, normally requiring spectroscopic inputs, can be obtained in future data sets from large-scale photometric surveys alone. The spectra prediction via AI can further assist in creating realistic mock catalogs.</description>

Abstract: Representing systems using the SAPPhIRE causality model is found useful in supporting design-by-analogy. However, creating a SAPPhIRE model of artificial or biological systems is an effort-intensive process that requires human experts to source technical knowledge from multiple technical documents regarding how the system works. This research investigates how to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) in creating structured descriptions of systems using the SAPPhIRE model of causality. This paper, the second part of the two-part research, presents a new Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tool for generating information related to SAPPhIRE constructs of artificial systems and reports the results from a preliminary evaluation of the tool's success - focusing on the factual accuracy and reliability of outcomes.</description>

      <title>Pron vs Prompt: Can Large Language Models already Challenge a World-Class Fiction Author at Creative Text Writing?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has become routine to report research results where Large Language Models (LLMs) outperform average humans in a wide range of language-related tasks, and creative text writing is no exception. It seems natural, then, to raise the bid: Are LLMs ready to compete in creative writing skills with a top (rather than average) novelist? To provide an initial answer for this question, we have carried out a contest between Patricio Pron (an awarded novelist, considered one of the best of his generation) and GPT-4 (one of the top performing LLMs), in the spirit of AI-human duels such as DeepBlue vs Kasparov and AlphaGo vs Lee Sidol. We asked Pron and GPT-4 to provide thirty titles each, and then to write short stories for both their titles and their opponent's. Then, we prepared an evaluation rubric inspired by Boden's definition of creativity, and we collected 5,400 manual assessments provided by literature critics and scholars. The results of our experimentation indicate that LLMs are still far from challenging a top human creative writer, and that reaching such level of autonomous creative writing skills probably cannot be reached simply with larger language models.</description>

      <title>Commute Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in learning from graph-structured data. However, their application to directed graphs (digraphs) presents unique challenges, primarily due to the inherent asymmetry in node relationships. Traditional GNNs are adept at capturing unidirectional relations but fall short in encoding the mutual path dependencies between nodes, such as asymmetrical shortest paths typically found in digraphs. Recognizing this gap, we introduce Commute Graph Neural Networks (CGNN), an approach that seamlessly integrates node-wise commute time into the message passing scheme. The cornerstone of CGNN is an efficient method for computing commute time using a newly formulated digraph Laplacian. Commute time is then integrated into the neighborhood aggregation process, with neighbor contributions weighted according to their respective commute time to the central node in each layer. It enables CGNN to directly capture the mutual, asymmetric relationships in digraphs. Extensive experiments confirm the superior performance of CGNN.</description>

      <title>Addressing a fundamental limitation in deep vision models: lack of spatial attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary aim of this manuscript is to underscore a significant limitation in current deep learning models, particularly vision models. Unlike human vision, which efficiently selects only the essential visual areas for further processing, leading to high speed and low energy consumption, deep vision models process the entire image. In this work, we examine this issue from a broader perspective and propose two solutions that could pave the way for the next generation of more efficient vision models. In the first solution, convolution and pooling operations are selectively applied to altered regions, with a change map sent to subsequent layers. This map indicates which computations need to be repeated. In the second solution, only the modified regions are processed by a semantic segmentation model, and the resulting segments are inserted into the corresponding areas of the previous output map. The code is available at https://github.com/aliborji/spatial_attention.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Role of Instruction Variety and Task Difficulty in Robotic Manipulation Tasks</title>

Abstract: Evaluating the generalisation capabilities of multimodal models based solely on their performance on out-of-distribution data fails to capture their true robustness. This work introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically examines the role of instructions and inputs in the generalisation abilities of such models, considering architectural design, input perturbations across language and vision modalities, and increased task complexity. The proposed framework uncovers the resilience of multimodal models to extreme instruction perturbations and their vulnerability to observational changes, raising concerns about overfitting to spurious correlations. By employing this evaluation framework on current Transformer-based multimodal models for robotic manipulation tasks, we uncover limitations and suggest future advancements should focus on architectural and training innovations that better integrate multimodal inputs, enhancing a model's generalisation prowess by prioritising sensitivity to input content over incidental correlations.</description>

      <title>Securing Multi-turn Conversational Language Models From Distributed Backdoor Triggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04151</link>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have acquired the ability to handle longer context lengths and understand nuances in text, expanding their dialogue capabilities beyond a single utterance. A popular user-facing application of LLMs is the multi-turn chat setting. Though longer chat memory and better understanding may seemingly benefit users, our paper exposes a vulnerability that leverages the multi-turn feature and strong learning ability of LLMs to harm the end-user: the backdoor. We demonstrate that LLMs can capture the combinational backdoor representation. Only upon presentation of triggers together does the backdoor activate. We also verify empirically that this representation is invariant to the position of the trigger utterance. Subsequently, inserting a single extra token into two utterances of 5%of the data can cause over 99% Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results with 3 triggers demonstrate that this framework is generalizable, compatible with any trigger in an adversary's toolbox in a plug-and-play manner. Defending the backdoor can be challenging in the chat setting because of the large input and output space. Our analysis indicates that the distributed backdoor exacerbates the current challenges by polynomially increasing the dimension of the attacked input space. Canonical textual defenses like ONION and BKI leverage auxiliary model forward passes over individual tokens, scaling exponentially with the input sequence length and struggling to maintain computational feasibility. To this end, we propose a decoding time defense - decayed contrastive decoding - that scales linearly with assistant response sequence length and reduces the backdoor to as low as 0.35%.</description>

      <title>Understanding Visual Feature Reliance through the Lens of Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that deep learning models inductive bias towards favoring simpler features may be one of the sources of shortcut learning. Yet, there has been limited focus on understanding the complexity of the myriad features that models learn. In this work, we introduce a new metric for quantifying feature complexity, based on $\mathscr{V}$-information and capturing whether a feature requires complex computational transformations to be extracted. Using this $\mathscr{V}$-information metric, we analyze the complexities of 10,000 features, represented as directions in the penultimate layer, that were extracted from a standard ImageNet-trained vision model. Our study addresses four key questions: First, we ask what features look like as a function of complexity and find a spectrum of simple to complex features present within the model. Second, we ask when features are learned during training. We find that simpler features dominate early in training, and more complex features emerge gradually. Third, we investigate where within the network simple and complex features flow, and find that simpler features tend to bypass the visual hierarchy via residual connections. Fourth, we explore the connection between features complexity and their importance in driving the networks decision. We find that complex features tend to be less important. Surprisingly, important features become accessible at earlier layers during training, like a sedimentation process, allowing the model to build upon these foundational elements.</description>

      <title>Virtual Personas for Language Models via an Anthology of Backstories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained from vast repositories of text authored by millions of distinct authors, reflecting an enormous diversity of human traits. While these models bear the potential to be used as approximations of human subjects in behavioral studies, prior efforts have been limited in steering model responses to match individual human users. In this work, we introduce "Anthology", a method for conditioning LLMs to particular virtual personas by harnessing open-ended life narratives, which we refer to as "backstories." We show that our methodology enhances the consistency and reliability of experimental outcomes while ensuring better representation of diverse sub-populations. Across three nationally representative human surveys conducted as part of Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (ATP), we demonstrate that Anthology achieves up to 18% improvement in matching the response distributions of human respondents and 27% improvement in consistency metrics. Our code and generated backstories are available at https://github.com/CannyLab/anthology.</description>

      <title>A Robust Governance for the AI Act: AI Office, AI Board, Scientific Panel, and National Authorities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regulation is nothing without enforcement. This particularly holds for the dynamic field of emerging technologies. Hence, this article has two ambitions. First, it explains how the EU's new Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) will be implemented and enforced by various institutional bodies, thus clarifying the governance framework of the AIA. Second, it proposes a normative model of governance, providing recommendations to ensure uniform and coordinated execution of the AIA and the fulfilment of the legislation. Taken together, the article explores how the AIA may be implemented by national and EU institutional bodies, encompassing longstanding bodies, such as the European Commission, and those newly established under the AIA, such as the AI Office. It investigates their roles across supranational and national levels, emphasizing how EU regulations influence institutional structures and operations. These regulations may not only directly dictate the structural design of institutions but also indirectly request administrative capacities needed to enforce the AIA.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Stereo Image Compression with Cross-Dimensional Entropy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of stereo vision technologies, stereo image compression has emerged as a crucial field that continues to draw significant attention. Previous approaches have primarily employed a unidirectional paradigm, where the compression of one view is dependent on the other, resulting in imbalanced compression. To address this issue, we introduce a symmetric bidirectional stereo image compression architecture, named BiSIC. Specifically, we propose a 3D convolution based codec backbone to capture local features and incorporate bidirectional attention blocks to exploit global features. Moreover, we design a novel cross-dimensional entropy model that integrates various conditioning factors, including the spatial context, channel context, and stereo dependency, to effectively estimate the distribution of latent representations for entropy coding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed BiSIC outperforms conventional image/video compression standards, as well as state-of-the-art learning-based methods, in terms of both PSNR and MS-SSIM.</description>

      <title>XEdgeAI: A Human-centered Industrial Inspection Framework with Data-centric Explainable Edge AI Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved visual quality inspection and predictive maintenance within industrial settings. However, deploying these technologies on low-resource edge devices poses substantial challenges due to their high computational demands and the inherent complexity of Explainable AI (XAI) methods. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel XAI-integrated Visual Quality Inspection framework that optimizes the deployment of semantic segmentation models on low-resource edge devices. Our framework incorporates XAI and the Large Vision Language Model to deliver human-centered interpretability through visual and textual explanations to end-users. This is crucial for end-user trust and model interpretability. We outline a comprehensive methodology consisting of six fundamental modules: base model fine-tuning, XAI-based explanation generation, evaluation of XAI approaches, XAI-guided data augmentation, development of an edge-compatible model, and the generation of understandable visual and textual explanations. Through XAI-guided data augmentation, the enhanced model incorporating domain expert knowledge with visual and textual explanations is successfully deployed on mobile devices to support end-users in real-world scenarios. Experimental results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed framework, with the mobile model achieving competitive accuracy while significantly reducing model size. This approach paves the way for the broader adoption of reliable and interpretable AI tools in critical industrial applications, where decisions must be both rapid and justifiable.

      <title>ModalChorus: Visual Probing and Alignment of Multi-modal Embeddings via Modal Fusion Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal embeddings form the foundation for vision-language models, such as CLIP embeddings, the most widely used text-image embeddings. However, these embeddings are vulnerable to subtle misalignment of cross-modal features, resulting in decreased model performance and diminished generalization. To address this problem, we design ModalChorus, an interactive system for visual probing and alignment of multi-modal embeddings. ModalChorus primarily offers a two-stage process: 1) embedding probing with Modal Fusion Map (MFM), a novel parametric dimensionality reduction method that integrates both metric and nonmetric objectives to enhance modality fusion; and 2) embedding alignment that allows users to interactively articulate intentions for both point-set and set-set alignments. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons for CLIP embeddings with existing dimensionality reduction (e.g., t-SNE and MDS) and data fusion (e.g., data context map) methods demonstrate the advantages of MFM in showcasing cross-modal features over common vision-language datasets. Case studies reveal that ModalChorus can facilitate intuitive discovery of misalignment and efficient re-alignment in scenarios ranging from zero-shot classification to cross-modal retrieval and generation.</description>

      <title>Assessing Brittleness of Image-Text Retrieval Benchmarks from Vision-Language Models Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15239v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the brittleness of the image-text retrieval (ITR) evaluation pipeline with a focus on concept granularity. We start by analyzing two common benchmarks, MS-COCO and Flickr30k, and compare them with augmented, fine-grained versions, MS-COCO-FG and Flickr30k-FG, given a specified set of linguistic features capturing concept granularity. Flickr30k-FG and MS COCO-FG consistently give rise to higher scores across all the selected features. To further our understanding of the impact of granularity we consider a novel taxonomy of query perturbations. We apply these perturbations to the selected datasets. We evaluate four diverse state-of-the-art Vision-Language models on both the standard and fine-grained datasets under zero-shot conditions, with and without the applied perturbations. The results demonstrate that although perturbations generally degrade model performance, the fine-grained datasets exhibit a smaller performance drop than their standard counterparts. The relative performance drop across all setups is consistent across all models and datasets, indicating that the issue lies within the benchmarks themselves. We conclude by providing an agenda for improving ITR evaluation pipelines.</description>

      <title>CLIP with Generative Latent Replay: a Strong Baseline for Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15793v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the emergence of Transformers and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP, fine-tuning large pre-trained models has recently become a prevalent strategy in Continual Learning. This has led to the development of numerous prompting strategies to adapt transformer-based models without incurring catastrophic forgetting. However, these strategies often compromise the original zero-shot capabilities of the pre-trained CLIP model and struggle to adapt to domains that significantly deviate from the pre-training data. In this work, we propose Continual Generative training for Incremental prompt-Learning, a simple and novel approach to mitigate forgetting while adapting CLIP. Briefly, we employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to learn class-conditioned distributions within the embedding space of the visual encoder. We then exploit these distributions to sample new synthetic visual embeddings and train the corresponding class-specific textual prompts during subsequent tasks. Through extensive experiments on different domains, we show that such a generative replay approach can adapt to new tasks while improving zero-shot capabilities, evaluated using a novel metric tailored for CL scenarios. Notably, further analysis reveals that our approach can bridge the gap with joint prompt tuning. The codebase is available at https://github.com/aimagelab/mammoth.</description>

      <title>Importance Sampling-Guided Meta-Training for Intelligent Agents in Highly Interactive Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training intelligent agents to navigate highly interactive environments presents significant challenges. While guided meta reinforcement learning (RL) approach that first trains a guiding policy to train the ego agent has proven effective in improving generalizability across scenarios with various levels of interaction, the state-of-the-art method tends to be overly sensitive to extreme cases, impairing the agents' performance in the more common scenarios. This study introduces a novel training framework that integrates guided meta RL with importance sampling (IS) to optimize training distributions iteratively for navigating highly interactive driving scenarios, such as T-intersections or roundabouts. Unlike traditional methods that may underrepresent critical interactions or overemphasize extreme cases during training, our approach strategically adjusts the training distribution towards more challenging driving behaviors using IS proposal distributions and applies the importance ratio to de-bias the result. By estimating a naturalistic distribution from real-world datasets and employing a mixture model for iterative training refinements, the framework ensures a balanced focus across common and extreme driving scenarios. Experiments conducted with both synthetic and naturalistic datasets demonstrate both accelerated training and performance improvements under highly interactive driving tasks.</description>

      <title>MOMAland: A Set of Benchmarks for Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many challenging tasks such as managing traffic systems, electricity grids, or supply chains involve complex decision-making processes that must balance multiple conflicting objectives and coordinate the actions of various independent decision-makers (DMs). One perspective for formalising and addressing such tasks is multi-objective multi-agent reinforcement learning (MOMARL). MOMARL broadens reinforcement learning (RL) to problems with multiple agents each needing to consider multiple objectives in their learning process. In reinforcement learning research, benchmarks are crucial in facilitating progress, evaluation, and reproducibility. The significance of benchmarks is underscored by the existence of numerous benchmark frameworks developed for various RL paradigms, including single-agent RL (e.g., Gymnasium), multi-agent RL (e.g., PettingZoo), and single-agent multi-objective RL (e.g., MO-Gymnasium). To support the advancement of the MOMARL field, we introduce MOMAland, the first collection of standardised environments for multi-objective multi-agent reinforcement learning. MOMAland addresses the need for comprehensive benchmarking in this emerging field, offering over 10 diverse environments that vary in the number of agents, state representations, reward structures, and utility considerations. To provide strong baselines for future research, MOMAland also includes algorithms capable of learning policies in such settings.</description>

      <title>Course-Correction: Safety Alignment Using Synthetic Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The risk of harmful content generated by large language models (LLMs) becomes a critical concern. This paper presents a systematic study on assessing and improving LLMs' capability to perform the task of \textbf{course-correction}, \ie, the model can steer away from generating harmful content autonomously. To start with, we introduce the \textsc{C$^2$-Eval} benchmark for quantitative assessment and analyze 10 popular LLMs, revealing varying proficiency of current safety-tuned LLMs in course-correction. To improve, we propose fine-tuning LLMs with preference learning, emphasizing the preference for timely course-correction. Using an automated pipeline, we create \textsc{C$^2$-Syn}, a synthetic dataset with 750K pairwise preferences, to teach models the concept of timely course-correction through data-driven preference learning. Experiments on 2 LLMs, \textsc{Llama2-Chat 7B} and \textsc{Qwen2 7B}, show that our method effectively enhances course-correction skills without affecting general performance. Additionally, it effectively improves LLMs' safety, particularly in resisting jailbreak attacks.</description>

      <title>Very Large-Scale Multi-Agent Simulation in AgentScope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for applying multi-agent systems in very large-scale simulations. However, there remain several challenges when conducting multi-agent simulations with existing platforms, such as limited scalability and low efficiency, unsatisfied agent diversity, and effort-intensive management processes. To address these challenges, we develop several new features and components for AgentScope, a user-friendly multi-agent platform, enhancing its convenience and flexibility for supporting very large-scale multi-agent simulations. Specifically, we propose an actor-based distributed mechanism as the underlying technological infrastructure towards great scalability and high efficiency, and provide flexible environment support for simulating various real-world scenarios, which enables parallel execution of multiple agents, automatic workflow conversion for distributed deployment, and both inter-agent and agent-environment interactions. Moreover, we integrate an easy-to-use configurable tool and an automatic background generation pipeline in AgentScope, simplifying the process of creating agents with diverse yet detailed background settings. Last but not least, we provide a web-based interface for conveniently monitoring and managing a large number of agents that might deploy across multiple devices. We conduct a comprehensive simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of these proposed enhancements in AgentScope, and provide detailed observations and insightful discussions to highlight the great potential of applying multi-agent systems in large-scale simulations. The source code is released on GitHub at https://github.com/modelscope/agentscope/tree/main/examples/paper_large_scale_simulation to inspire further research and development in large-scale multi-agent simulations.</description>

      <title>SAM 2: Segment Anything in Images and Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), a foundation model towards solving promptable visual segmentation in images and videos. We build a data engine, which improves model and data via user interaction, to collect the largest video segmentation dataset to date. Our model is a simple transformer architecture with streaming memory for real-time video processing. SAM 2 trained on our data provides strong performance across a wide range of tasks. In video segmentation, we observe better accuracy, using 3x fewer interactions than prior approaches. In image segmentation, our model is more accurate and 6x faster than the Segment Anything Model (SAM). We believe that our data, model, and insights will serve as a significant milestone for video segmentation and related perception tasks. We are releasing our main model, dataset, as well as code for model training and our demo.</description>

      <title>LLaVA-OneVision: Easy Visual Task Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present LLaVA-OneVision, a family of open large multimodal models (LMMs) developed by consolidating our insights into data, models, and visual representations in the LLaVA-NeXT blog series. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLaVA-OneVision is the first single model that can simultaneously push the performance boundaries of open LMMs in three important computer vision scenarios: single-image, multi-image, and video scenarios. Importantly, the design of LLaVA-OneVision allows strong transfer learning across different modalities/scenarios, yielding new emerging capabilities. In particular, strong video understanding and cross-scenario capabilities are demonstrated through task transfer from images to videos.</description>

      <title>Generating novel experimental hypotheses from language models: A case study on cross-dative generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural network language models (LMs) have been shown to successfully capture complex linguistic knowledge. However, their utility for understanding language acquisition is still debated. We contribute to this debate by presenting a case study where we use LMs as simulated learners to derive novel experimental hypotheses to be tested with humans. We apply this paradigm to study cross-dative generalization (CDG): productive generalization of novel verbs across dative constructions (she pilked me the ball/she pilked the ball to me)--acquisition of which is known to involve a large space of contextual features--using LMs trained on child-directed speech. We specifically ask: "what properties of the training exposure facilitate a novel verb's generalization to the (unmodeled) alternate construction?" To answer this, we systematically vary the exposure context in which a novel dative verb occurs in terms of the properties of the theme and recipient, and then analyze the LMs' usage of the novel verb in the unmodeled dative construction. We find LMs to replicate known patterns of children's CDG, as a precondition to exploring novel hypotheses. Subsequent simulations reveal a nuanced role of the features of the novel verbs' exposure context on the LMs' CDG. We find CDG to be facilitated when the first postverbal argument of the exposure context is pronominal, definite, short, and conforms to the prototypical animacy expectations of the exposure dative. These patterns are characteristic of harmonic alignment in datives, where the argument with features ranking higher on the discourse prominence scale tends to precede the other. This gives rise to a novel hypothesis that CDG is facilitated insofar as the features of the exposure context--in particular, its first postverbal argument--are harmonically aligned. We conclude by proposing future experiments that can test this hypothesis in children.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Structured Neural Network for Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR) is a crucial component of the retrieval stage in (Ads) Recommendation System that utilizes Two Tower or Siamese Networks to learn embeddings for both users and items (ads). It then employs an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANN) to efficiently retrieve the most relevant ads for a specific user. Despite the recent rise to popularity in the industry, they have a couple of limitations. Firstly, Two Tower model architecture uses a single dot product interaction which despite their efficiency fail to capture the data distribution in practice. Secondly, the centroid representation and cluster assignment, which are components of ANN, occur after the training process has been completed. As a result, they do not take into account the optimization criteria used for retrieval model. In this paper, we present Hierarchical Structured Neural Network (HSNN), a deployed jointly optimized hierarchical clustering and neural network model that can take advantage of sophisticated interactions and model architectures that are more common in the ranking stages while maintaining a sub-linear inference cost. We achieve 6.5% improvement in offline evaluation and also demonstrate 1.22% online gains through A/B experiments. HSNN has been successfully deployed into the Ads Recommendation system and is currently handling major portion of the traffic. The paper shares our experience in developing this system, dealing with challenges like freshness, volatility, cold start recommendations, cluster collapse and lessons deploying the model in a large scale retrieval production system.</description>

      <title>A Multivocal Literature Review on Privacy and Fairness in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning presents a way to revolutionize AI applications by eliminating the necessity for data sharing. Yet, research has shown that information can still be extracted during training, making additional privacy-preserving measures such as differential privacy imperative. To implement real-world federated learning applications, fairness, ranging from a fair distribution of performance to non-discriminative behaviour, must be considered. Particularly in high-risk applications (e.g. healthcare), avoiding the repetition of past discriminatory errors is paramount. As recent research has demonstrated an inherent tension between privacy and fairness, we conduct a multivocal literature review to examine the current methods to integrate privacy and fairness in federated learning. Our analyses illustrate that the relationship between privacy and fairness has been neglected, posing a critical risk for real-world applications. We highlight the need to explore the relationship between privacy, fairness, and performance, advocating for the creation of integrated federated learning frameworks.</description>

      <title>Memorization in In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has proven to be an effective strategy for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) with no additional training. However, the exact mechanism behind this performance improvement remains unclear. This study is the first to show how ICL surfaces memorized training data and to explore the correlation between this memorization and performance on downstream tasks across various ICL regimes: zero-shot, few-shot, and many-shot. Our most notable findings include: (1) ICL significantly surfaces memorization compared to zero-shot learning in most cases; (2) demonstrations, without their labels, are the most effective element in surfacing memorization; (3) ICL improves performance when the surfaced memorization in few-shot regimes reaches a high level (about 40%); and (4) there is a very strong correlation between performance and memorization in ICL when it outperforms zero-shot learning. Overall, our study uncovers memorization as a new factor impacting ICL, raising an important question: to what extent do LLMs truly generalize from demonstrations in ICL, and how much of their success is due to memorization?</description>

      <title>Transforming Location Retrieval at Airbnb: A Journey from Heuristics to Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Airbnb search system grapples with many unique challenges as it continues to evolve. We oversee a marketplace that is nuanced by geography, diversity of homes, and guests with a variety of preferences. Crafting an efficient search system that can accommodate diverse guest needs, while showcasing relevant homes lies at the heart of Airbnb's success. Airbnb search has many challenges that parallel other recommendation and search systems but it has a unique information retrieval problem, upstream of ranking, called location retrieval. It requires defining a topological map area that is relevant to the searched query for homes listing retrieval. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the methodology, challenges, and impact of building a machine learning based location retrieval product from the ground up. Despite the lack of suitable, prevalent machine learning based approaches, we tackle cold start, generalization, differentiation and algorithmic bias. We detail the efficacy of heuristics, statistics, machine learning, and reinforcement learning approaches to solve these challenges, particularly for systems that are often unexplored by current literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report evaluates the performance impact of enabling Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) on nVIDIA Hopper GPUs for large language model (LLM) inference tasks. We benchmark the overhead introduced by TEE mode across various LLMs and token lengths, with a particular focus on the bottleneck caused by CPU-GPU data transfers via PCIe. Our results indicate that while there is minimal computational overhead within the GPU, the overall performance penalty is primarily attributable to data transfer. For the majority of typical LLM queries, the overhead remains below 7%, with larger models and longer sequences experiencing nearly zero overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of visual communication and musical interaction by implementing a robotic camera within a "Guided Harmony" musical game. We aim to examine co-creative behaviors between human musicians and robotic systems. Our research explores existing methodologies like improvisational game pieces and extends these concepts to include robotic participation using a PTZ camera. The robotic system interprets and responds to nonverbal cues from musicians, creating a collaborative and adaptive musical experience. This initial case study underscores the importance of intuitive visual communication channels. We also propose future research directions, including parameters for refining the visual cue toolkit and data collection methods to understand human-machine co-creativity further. Our findings contribute to the broader understanding of machine intelligence in augmenting human creativity, particularly in musical settings.</description>

      <title>The CLC-UKET Dataset: Benchmarking Case Outcome Prediction for the UK Employment Tribunal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08098v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the intersection of technological innovation and access to justice by developing a benchmark for predicting case outcomes in the UK Employment Tribunal (UKET). To address the challenge of extensive manual annotation, the study employs a large language model (LLM) for automatic annotation, resulting in the creation of the CLC-UKET dataset. The dataset consists of approximately 19,000 UKET cases and their metadata. Comprehensive legal annotations cover facts, claims, precedent references, statutory references, case outcomes, reasons and jurisdiction codes. Facilitated by the CLC-UKET data, we examine a multi-class case outcome prediction task in the UKET. Human predictions are collected to establish a performance reference for model comparison. Empirical results from baseline models indicate that finetuned transformer models outperform zero-shot and few-shot LLMs on the UKET prediction task. The performance of zero-shot LLMs can be enhanced by integrating task-related information into few-shot examples. We hope that the CLC-UKET dataset, along with human annotations and empirical findings, can serve as a valuable benchmark for employment-related dispute resolution.</description>

      <title>Detection Made Easy: Potentials of Large Language Models for Solidity Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The large-scale deployment of Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum mainnet has increasingly attracted financially-motivated attackers in recent years. A few now-infamous attacks in Ethereum's history includes DAO attack in 2016 (50 million dollars lost), Parity Wallet hack in 2017 (146 million dollars locked), Beautychain's token BEC in 2018 (900 million dollars market value fell to 0), and NFT gaming blockchain breach in 2022 ($600 million in Ether stolen). This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of the use of large language models (LLMs) and their capabilities in detecting OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities in Solidity. We introduce a novel, class-balanced, structured, and labeled dataset named VulSmart, which we use to benchmark and compare the performance of open-source LLMs such as CodeLlama, Llama2, CodeT5 and Falcon, alongside closed-source models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o Mini. Our proposed SmartVD framework is rigorously tested against these models through extensive automated and manual evaluations, utilizing BLEU and ROUGE metrics to assess the effectiveness of vulnerability detection in smart contracts. We also explore three distinct prompting strategies-zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought-to evaluate the multi-class classification and generative capabilities of the SmartVD framework. Our findings reveal that SmartVD outperforms its open-source counterparts and even exceeds the performance of closed-source base models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 Mini. After fine-tuning, the closed-source models, GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o Mini, achieved remarkable performance with 99% accuracy in detecting vulnerabilities, 94% in identifying their types, and 98% in determining severity. Notably, SmartVD performs best with the `chain-of-thought' prompting technique, whereas the fine-tuned closed-source models excel with the `zero-shot' prompting approach.</description>

      <title>SuperCoder2.0: Technical Report on Exploring the feasibility of LLMs as Autonomous Programmer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SuperCoder2.0, an advanced autonomous system designed to enhance software development through artificial intelligence. The system combines an AI-native development approach with intelligent agents to enable fully autonomous coding. Key focus areas include a retry mechanism with error output traceback, comprehensive code rewriting and replacement using Abstract Syntax Tree (ast) parsing to minimize linting issues, code embedding technique for retrieval-augmented generation, and a focus on localizing methods for problem-solving rather than identifying specific line numbers. The methodology employs a three-step hierarchical search space reduction approach for code base navigation and bug localization:utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and a Repository File Level Map to identify candidate files, (2) narrowing down to the most relevant files using a File Level Schematic Map, and (3) extracting 'relevant locations' within these files. Code editing is performed through a two-part module comprising CodeGeneration and CodeEditing, which generates multiple solutions at different temperature values and replaces entire methods or classes to maintain code integrity. A feedback loop executes repository-level test cases to validate and refine solutions. Experiments conducted on the SWE-bench Lite dataset demonstrate SuperCoder2.0's effectiveness, achieving correct file localization in 84.33% of cases within the top 5 candidates and successfully resolving 34% of test instances. This performance places SuperCoder2.0 fourth globally on the SWE-bench leaderboard. The system's ability to handle diverse repositories and problem types highlights its potential as a versatile tool for autonomous software development. Future work will focus on refining the code editing process and exploring advanced embedding models for improved natural language to code mapping.</description>

      <title>LatentQGAN: A Hybrid QGAN with Classical Convolutional Autoencoder</title>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning consists in taking advantage of quantum computations to generate classical data. A potential application of quantum machine learning is to harness the power of quantum computers for generating classical data, a process essential to a multitude of applications such as enriching training datasets, anomaly detection, and risk management in finance. Given the success of Generative Adversarial Networks in classical image generation, the development of its quantum versions has been actively conducted. However, existing implementations on quantum computers often face significant challenges, such as scalability and training convergence issues. To address these issues, we propose LatentQGAN, a novel quantum model that uses a hybrid quantum-classical GAN coupled with an autoencoder. Although it was initially designed for image generation, the LatentQGAN approach holds potential for broader application across various practical data generation tasks. Experimental outcomes on both classical simulators and noisy intermediate scale quantum computers have demonstrated significant performance enhancements over existing quantum methods, alongside a significant reduction in quantum resources overhead.</description>

      <title>NeuroPath: A Neural Pathway Transformer for Joining the Dots of Human Connectomes</title>

Abstract: Although modern imaging technologies allow us to study connectivity between two distinct brain regions in-vivo, an in-depth understanding of how anatomical structure supports brain function and how spontaneous functional fluctuations emerge remarkable cognition is still elusive. Meanwhile, tremendous efforts have been made in the realm of machine learning to establish the nonlinear mapping between neuroimaging data and phenotypic traits. However, the absence of neuroscience insight in the current approaches poses significant challenges in understanding cognitive behavior from transient neural activities. To address this challenge, we put the spotlight on the coupling mechanism of structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) by formulating such network neuroscience question into an expressive graph representation learning problem for high-order topology. Specifically, we introduce the concept of topological detour to characterize how a ubiquitous instance of FC (direct link) is supported by neural pathways (detour) physically wired by SC, which forms a cyclic loop interacted by brain structure and function. In the clich\'e of machine learning, the multi-hop detour pathway underlying SC-FC coupling allows us to devise a novel multi-head self-attention mechanism within Transformer to capture multi-modal feature representation from paired graphs of SC and FC. Taken together, we propose a biological-inspired deep model, coined as NeuroPath, to find putative connectomic feature representations from the unprecedented amount of neuroimages, which can be plugged into various downstream applications such as task recognition and disease diagnosis. We have evaluated NeuroPath on large-scale public datasets including HCP and UK Biobank under supervised and zero-shot learning, where the state-of-the-art performance by our NeuroPath indicates great potential in network neuroscience.</description>

      <title>SimVG: A Simple Framework for Visual Grounding with Decoupled Multi-modal Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual grounding is a common vision task that involves grounding descriptive sentences to the corresponding regions of an image. Most existing methods use independent image-text encoding and apply complex hand-crafted modules or encoder-decoder architectures for modal interaction and query reasoning. However, their performance significantly drops when dealing with complex textual expressions. This is because the former paradigm only utilizes limited downstream data to fit the multi-modal feature fusion. Therefore, it is only effective when the textual expressions are relatively simple. In contrast, given the wide diversity of textual expressions and the uniqueness of downstream training data, the existing fusion module, which extracts multimodal content from a visual-linguistic context, has not been fully investigated. In this paper, we present a simple yet robust transformer-based framework, SimVG, for visual grounding. Specifically, we decouple visual-linguistic feature fusion from downstream tasks by leveraging existing multimodal pre-trained models and incorporating additional object tokens to facilitate deep integration of downstream and pre-training tasks. Furthermore, we design a dynamic weight-balance distillation method in the multi-branch synchronous learning process to enhance the representation capability of the simpler branch. This branch only consists of a lightweight MLP, which simplifies the structure and improves reasoning speed. Experiments on six widely used VG datasets, i.e., RefCOCO/+/g, ReferIt, Flickr30K, and GRefCOCO, demonstrate the superiority of SimVG. Finally, the proposed method not only achieves improvements in efficiency and convergence speed but also attains new state-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks. Codes and models will be available at \url{https://github.com/Dmmm1997/SimVG}.</description>

      <title>On the Implicit Relation Between Low-Rank Adaptation and Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant approach in natural language processing involves large-scale pre-training models on general domain data followed by their adaptation to specific tasks or domains. As models grow in size, full fine-tuning all of their parameters becomes increasingly impractical. To address this, some methods for low-rank task adaptation of language models have been proposed, e.g., LoRA and FLoRA. These methods keep the pre-trained model weights fixed and incorporate trainable low-rank decomposition matrices into some layers of the transformer architecture, called adapters. This approach significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters required for downstream tasks compared to full fine-tuning all parameters. In this work, we look at low-rank adaptation from the lens of data privacy. We show theoretically that the low-rank adaptation used in LoRA and FLoRA is equivalent to injecting some random noise into the batch gradients w.r.t the adapter parameters, and we quantify the variance of the injected noise. By establishing a Berry-Esseen type bound on the total variation distance between distribution of the injected noise and a Gaussian distribution with the same variance, we show that the dynamics of low-rank adaptation is close to that of differentially private fine-tuning of the adapters. Finally, using Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, we show that when augmented with gradient scaling, low-rank adaptation is very close to performing DPSGD algorithm with a fixed noise scale to fine-tune the adapters. These theoretical findings suggest that unlike other existing fine-tuning algorithms, low-rank adaptation provides privacy w.r.t the fine-tuning data implicitly.</description>

      <title>Pioneering Reliable Assessment in Text-to-Image Knowledge Editing: Leveraging a Fine-Grained Dataset and an Innovative Criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During pre-training, the Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models encode factual knowledge into their parameters. These parameterized facts enable realistic image generation, but they may become obsolete over time, thereby misrepresenting the current state of the world. Knowledge editing techniques aim to update model knowledge in a targeted way. However, facing the dual challenges posed by inadequate editing datasets and unreliable evaluation criterion, the development of T2I knowledge editing encounter difficulties in effectively generalizing injected knowledge. In this work, we design a T2I knowledge editing framework by comprehensively spanning on three phases: First, we curate a dataset \textbf{CAKE}, comprising paraphrase and multi-object test, to enable more fine-grained assessment on knowledge generalization. Second, we propose a novel criterion, \textbf{adaptive CLIP threshold}, to effectively filter out false successful images under the current criterion and achieve reliable editing evaluation. Finally, we introduce \textbf{MPE}, a simple but effective approach for T2I knowledge editing. Instead of tuning parameters, MPE precisely recognizes and edits the outdated part of the conditioning text-prompt to accommodate the up-to-date knowledge. A straightforward implementation of MPE (Based on in-context learning) exhibits better overall performance than previous model editors. We hope these efforts can further promote faithful evaluation of T2I knowledge editing methods.</description>

      <title>LLMs Know More Than They Show: On the Intrinsic Representation of LLM Hallucinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce errors, including factual inaccuracies, biases, and reasoning failures, collectively referred to as "hallucinations". Recent studies have demonstrated that LLMs' internal states encode information regarding the truthfulness of their outputs, and that this information can be utilized to detect errors. In this work, we show that the internal representations of LLMs encode much more information about truthfulness than previously recognized. We first discover that the truthfulness information is concentrated in specific tokens, and leveraging this property significantly enhances error detection performance. Yet, we show that such error detectors fail to generalize across datasets, implying that -- contrary to prior claims -- truthfulness encoding is not universal but rather multifaceted. Next, we show that internal representations can also be used for predicting the types of errors the model is likely to make, facilitating the development of tailored mitigation strategies. Lastly, we reveal a discrepancy between LLMs' internal encoding and external behavior: they may encode the correct answer, yet consistently generate an incorrect one. Taken together, these insights deepen our understanding of LLM errors from the model's internal perspective, which can guide future research on enhancing error analysis and mitigation.</description>

      <title>Better Instruction-Following Through Minimum Bayes Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02902v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General-purpose LLM judges capable of human-level evaluation provide not only a scalable and accurate way of evaluating instruction-following LLMs but also new avenues for supervising and improving their performance. One promising way of leveraging LLM judges for supervision is through Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding, which uses a reference-based evaluator to select a high-quality output from amongst a set of candidate outputs. In the first part of this work, we explore using MBR decoding as a method for improving the test-time performance of instruction-following LLMs. We find that MBR decoding with reference-based LLM judges substantially improves over greedy decoding, best-of-N decoding with reference-free judges and MBR decoding with lexical and embedding-based metrics on AlpacaEval and MT-Bench. These gains are consistent across LLMs with up to 70B parameters, demonstrating that smaller LLM judges can be used to supervise much larger LLMs. Then, seeking to retain the improvements from MBR decoding while mitigating additional test-time costs, we explore iterative self-training on MBR-decoded outputs. We find that self-training using Direct Preference Optimisation leads to significant performance gains, such that the self-trained models with greedy decoding generally match and sometimes exceed the performance of their base models with MBR decoding.</description>

      <title>AutoPenBench: Benchmarking Generative Agents for Penetration Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI agents, software systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are emerging as a promising approach to automate cybersecurity tasks. Among the others, penetration testing is a challenging field due to the task complexity and the diverse strategies to simulate cyber-attacks. Despite growing interest and initial studies in automating penetration testing with generative agents, there remains a significant gap in the form of a comprehensive and standard framework for their evaluation and development. This paper introduces AutoPenBench, an open benchmark for evaluating generative agents in automated penetration testing. We present a comprehensive framework that includes 33 tasks, each representing a vulnerable system that the agent has to attack. Tasks are of increasing difficulty levels, including in-vitro and real-world scenarios. We assess the agent performance with generic and specific milestones that allow us to compare results in a standardised manner and understand the limits of the agent under test. We show the benefits of AutoPenBench by testing two agent architectures: a fully autonomous and a semi-autonomous supporting human interaction. We compare their performance and limitations. For example, the fully autonomous agent performs unsatisfactorily achieving a 21% Success Rate (SR) across the benchmark, solving 27% of the simple tasks and only one real-world task. In contrast, the assisted agent demonstrates substantial improvements, with 64% of SR. AutoPenBench allows us also to observe how different LLMs like GPT-4o or OpenAI o1 impact the ability of the agents to complete the tasks. We believe that our benchmark fills the gap with a standard and flexible framework to compare penetration testing agents on a common ground. We hope to extend AutoPenBench along with the research community by making it available under https://github.com/lucagioacchini/auto-pen-bench.</description>

      <title>How much can we forget about Data Contamination?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The leakage of benchmark data into the training data has emerged as a significant challenge for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we use experimental evidence and theoretical estimates to challenge the common assumption that small-scale contamination renders benchmark evaluations invalid. First, we experimentally quantify the magnitude of benchmark overfitting based on scaling along three dimensions: The number of model parameters (up to 1.6B), the number of times an example is seen (up to 144), and the number of training tokens (up to 40B). We find that if model and data follow the Chinchilla scaling laws, minor contamination indeed leads to overfitting. At the same time, even 144 times of contamination can be forgotten if the training data is scaled beyond five times Chinchilla, a regime characteristic of many modern LLMs. We then derive a simple theory of example forgetting via cumulative weight decay. It allows us to bound the number of gradient steps required to forget past data for any training run where we know the hyperparameters of AdamW. This indicates that many LLMs, including Llama 3, have forgotten the data seen at the beginning of training. Experimentally, we demonstrate that forgetting occurs faster than what is predicted by our bounds. Taken together, our results suggest that moderate amounts of contamination can be forgotten at the end of realistically scaled training runs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of efficient auto-regressive generation in sequence prediction models by introducing FutureFill - a method for fast generation that applies to any sequence prediction algorithm based on convolutional operators. Our approach reduces the generation time requirement from quadratic to quasilinear relative to the context length. Additionally, FutureFill requires a prefill cache sized only by the number of tokens generated, which is smaller than the cache requirements for standard convolutional and attention-based models. We validate our theoretical findings with experimental evidence demonstrating correctness and efficiency gains in a synthetic generation task.</description>

      <title>FINALLY: fast and universal speech enhancement with studio-like quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of speech enhancement in real-world recordings, which often contain various forms of distortion, such as background noise, reverberation, and microphone artifacts. We revisit the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for speech enhancement and theoretically show that GANs are naturally inclined to seek the point of maximum density within the conditional clean speech distribution, which, as we argue, is essential for the speech enhancement task. We study various feature extractors for perceptual loss to facilitate the stability of adversarial training, developing a methodology for probing the structure of the feature space. This leads us to integrate WavLM-based perceptual loss into MS-STFT adversarial training pipeline, creating an effective and stable training procedure for the speech enhancement model. The resulting speech enhancement model, which we refer to as FINALLY, builds upon the HiFi++ architecture, augmented with a WavLM encoder and a novel training pipeline. Empirical results on various datasets confirm our model's ability to produce clear, high-quality speech at 48 kHz, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of speech enhancement.

      <title>MOOSE-Chem: Large Language Models for Rediscovering Unseen Chemistry Scientific Hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific discovery contributes largely to human society's prosperity, and recent progress shows that LLMs could potentially catalyze this process. However, it is still unclear whether LLMs can discover novel and valid hypotheses in chemistry. In this work, we investigate this central research question: Can LLMs automatically discover novel and valid chemistry research hypotheses given only a chemistry research background (consisting of a research question and/or a background survey), without limitation on the domain of the research question? After extensive discussions with chemistry experts, we propose an assumption that a majority of chemistry hypotheses can be resulted from a research background and several inspirations. With this key insight, we break the central question into three smaller fundamental questions. In brief, they are: (1) given a background question, whether LLMs can retrieve good inspirations; (2) with background and inspirations, whether LLMs can lead to hypothesis; and (3) whether LLMs can identify good hypotheses to rank them higher. To investigate these questions, we construct a benchmark consisting of 51 chemistry papers published in Nature, Science, or a similar level in 2024 (all papers are only available online since 2024). Every paper is divided by chemistry PhD students into three components: background, inspirations, and hypothesis. The goal is to rediscover the hypothesis, given only the background and a large randomly selected chemistry literature corpus consisting the ground truth inspiration papers, with LLMs trained with data up to 2023. We also develop an LLM-based multi-agent framework that leverages the assumption, consisting of three stages reflecting the three smaller questions. The proposed method can rediscover many hypotheses with very high similarity with the ground truth ones, covering the main innovations.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Data Heterogeneity Evaluation Approaches for Personalized Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is growing research interest in measuring the statistical heterogeneity of clients' local datasets. Such measurements are used to estimate the suitability for collaborative training of personalized federated learning (PFL) models. Currently, these research endeavors are taking place in silos and there is a lack of a unified benchmark to provide a fair and convenient comparison among various approaches in common settings. We aim to bridge this important gap in this paper. The proposed benchmarking framework currently includes six representative approaches. Extensive experiments have been conducted to compare these approaches under five standard non-IID FL settings, providing much needed insights into which approaches are advantageous under which settings. The proposed framework offers useful guidance on the suitability of various data divergence measures in FL systems. It is beneficial for keeping related research activities on the right track in terms of: (1) designing PFL schemes, (2) selecting appropriate data heterogeneity evaluation approaches for specific FL application scenarios, and (3) addressing fairness issues in collaborative model training.

      <title>Masked Generative Priors Improve World Models Sequence Modelling Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the leading approach for creating artificial agents in complex environments. Model-based approaches, which are RL methods with world models that predict environment dynamics, are among the most promising directions for improving data efficiency, forming a critical step toward bridging the gap between research and real-world deployment. In particular, world models enhance sample efficiency by learning in imagination, which involves training a generative sequence model of the environment in a self-supervised manner. Recently, Masked Generative Modelling has emerged as a more efficient and superior inductive bias for modelling and generating token sequences. Building on the Efficient Stochastic Transformer-based World Models (STORM) architecture, we replace the traditional MLP prior with a Masked Generative Prior (e.g., MaskGIT Prior) and introduce GIT-STORM. We evaluate our model on two downstream tasks: reinforcement learning and video prediction. GIT-STORM demonstrates substantial performance gains in RL tasks on the Atari 100k benchmark. Moreover, we apply Transformer-based World Models to continuous action environments for the first time, addressing a significant gap in prior research. To achieve this, we employ a state mixer function that integrates latent state representations with actions, enabling our model to handle continuous control tasks. We validate this approach through qualitative and quantitative analyses on the DeepMind Control Suite, showcasing the effectiveness of Transformer-based World Models in this new domain. Our results highlight the versatility and efficacy of the MaskGIT dynamics prior, paving the way for more accurate world models and effective RL policies.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Universal Value Function Approximators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There have been key advancements to building universal approximators for multi-goal collections of reinforcement learning value functions -- key elements in estimating long-term returns of states in a parameterized manner. We extend this to hierarchical reinforcement learning, using the options framework, by introducing hierarchical universal value function approximators (H-UVFAs). This allows us to leverage the added benefits of scaling, planning, and generalization expected in temporal abstraction settings. We develop supervised and reinforcement learning methods for learning embeddings of the states, goals, options, and actions in the two hierarchical value functions: $Q(s, g, o; \theta)$ and $Q(s, g, o, a; \theta)$. Finally we demonstrate generalization of the HUVFAs and show they outperform corresponding UVFAs.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning with Neuromorphic Computing: Theories, Methods, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To adapt to real-world dynamics, intelligent systems need to assimilate new knowledge without catastrophic forgetting, where learning new tasks leads to a degradation in performance on old tasks. To address this, continual learning concept is proposed for enabling autonomous systems to acquire new knowledge and dynamically adapt to changing environments. Specifically, energy-efficient continual learning is needed to ensure the functionality of autonomous systems under tight compute and memory resource budgets (i.e., so-called autonomous embedded systems). Neuromorphic computing, with brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), offers inherent advantages for enabling low-power/energy continual learning in autonomous embedded systems. In this paper, we comprehensively discuss the foundations and methods for enabling continual learning in neural networks, then analyze the state-of-the-art works considering SNNs. Afterward, comparative analyses of existing methods are conducted while considering crucial design factors, such as network complexity, memory, latency, and power/energy efficiency. We also explore the practical applications that can benefit from SNN-based continual learning and open challenges in real-world scenarios. In this manner, our survey provides valuable insights into the recent advancements of SNN-based continual learning for real-world application use-cases.</description>

      <title>From Theory to Practice: Implementing and Evaluating e-Fold Cross-Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces e-fold cross-validation, an energy-efficient alternative to k-fold cross-validation. It dynamically adjusts the number of folds based on a stopping criterion. The criterion checks after each fold whether the standard deviation of the evaluated folds has consistently decreased or remained stable. Once met, the process stops early. We tested e-fold cross-validation on 15 datasets and 10 machine-learning algorithms. On average, it required 4 fewer folds than 10-fold cross-validation, reducing evaluation time, computational resources, and energy use by about 40%. Performance differences between e-fold and 10-fold cross-validation were less than 2% for larger datasets. More complex models showed even smaller discrepancies. In 96% of iterations, the results were within the confidence interval, confirming statistical significance. E-fold cross-validation offers a reliable and efficient alternative to k-fold, reducing computational costs while maintaining comparable accuracy.</description>

      <title>ReLU's Revival: On the Entropic Overload in Normalization-Free Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LayerNorm is a critical component in modern large language models (LLMs) for stabilizing training and ensuring smooth optimization. However, it introduces significant challenges in mechanistic interpretability, outlier feature suppression, faithful signal propagation, and computational and communication complexity of private inference. This work explores desirable activation functions in normalization-free decoder-only LLMs. Contrary to the conventional preference for the GELU in transformer-based models, our empirical findings demonstrate an {\em opposite trend} -- ReLU significantly outperforms GELU in LayerNorm-free models, leading to an {\bf 8.2\%} perplexity improvement. We discover a key issue with GELU, where early layers experience entropic overload, leading to the under-utilization of the representational capacity of attention heads. This highlights that smoother activations like GELU are {\em ill-suited} for LayerNorm-free architectures, whereas ReLU's geometrical properties -- specialization in input space and intra-class selectivity -- lead to improved learning dynamics and better information retention in the absence of LayerNorm. This study offers key insights for optimizing transformer architectures where LayerNorm introduces significant challenges.</description>

      <title>LOBG:Less Overfitting for Better Generalization in Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing prompt learning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) have effectively enhanced the transfer capability of VLM to downstream tasks, but they suffer from a significant decline in generalization due to severe overfitting. To address this issue, we propose a framework named LOBG for vision-language models. Specifically, we use CLIP to filter out fine-grained foreground information that might cause overfitting, thereby guiding prompts with basic visual concepts. To further mitigate overfitting, we devel oped a structural topology preservation (STP) loss at the feature level, which endows the feature space with overall plasticity, allowing effective reshaping of the feature space during optimization. Additionally, we employed hierarchical logit distilation (HLD) at the output level to constrain outputs, complementing STP at the output end. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves generalization capability and alleviates overfitting compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Time-Series Foundation Model for Value-at-Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study is the first to explore the application of a time-series foundation model for Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimation. Foundation models, pre-trained on vast and varied datasets, can be used in a zero-shot setting with relatively minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare the performance of Google's model, called TimesFM, against conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH, Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), and empirical quantile estimates, using daily returns from the S\&amp;P 100 index and its constituents over 19 years. Our backtesting results indicate that in terms of the actual-over-expected ratio the fine-tuned TimesFM model consistently outperforms traditional methods. Regarding the quantile score loss function, it achieves performance comparable to the best econometric approach, the GAS model. Overall, the foundation model is either the best or among the top performers in forecasting VaR across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 VaR levels. We also found that fine-tuning significantly improves the results, and the model should not be used in zero-shot settings.</description>

      <title>Learning Smooth Humanoid Locomotion through Lipschitz-Constrained Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning combined with sim-to-real transfer offers a general framework for developing locomotion controllers for legged robots. To facilitate successful deployment in the real world, smoothing techniques, such as low-pass filters and smoothness rewards, are often employed to develop policies with smooth behaviors. However, because these techniques are non-differentiable and usually require tedious tuning of a large set of hyperparameters, they tend to require extensive manual tuning for each robotic platform. To address this challenge and establish a general technique for enforcing smooth behaviors, we propose a simple and effective method that imposes a Lipschitz constraint on a learned policy, which we refer to as Lipschitz-Constrained Policies (LCP). We show that the Lipschitz constraint can be implemented in the form of a gradient penalty, which provides a differentiable objective that can be easily incorporated with automatic differentiation frameworks. We demonstrate that LCP effectively replaces the need for smoothing rewards or low-pass filters and can be easily integrated into training frameworks for many distinct humanoid robots. We extensively evaluate LCP in both simulation and real-world humanoid robots, producing smooth and robust locomotion controllers. All simulation and deployment code, along with complete checkpoints, is available on our project page: https://lipschitz-constrained-policy.github.io.</description>

      <title>Large-scale cloze evaluation reveals that token prediction tasks are neither lexically nor semantically aligned</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we compare the generative behavior at the next token prediction level in several language models by comparing them to human productions in the cloze task. We find that while large models trained for longer are typically better estimators of human productions, but they reliably under-estimate the probabilities of human responses, over-rank rare responses, under-rank top responses, and produce highly distinct semantic spaces. Altogether, this work demonstrates in a tractable, interpretable domain that LM generations can not be used as replacements of or models of the cloze task.</description>

      <title>CrediRAG: Network-Augmented Credibility-Based Retrieval for Misinformation Detection in Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fake news threatens democracy and exacerbates the polarization and divisions in society; therefore, accurately detecting online misinformation is the foundation of addressing this issue. We present CrediRAG, the first fake news detection model that combines language models with access to a rich external political knowledge base with a dense social network to detect fake news across social media at scale. CrediRAG uses a news retriever to initially assign a misinformation score to each post based on the source credibility of similar news articles to the post title content. CrediRAG then improves the initial retrieval estimations through a novel weighted post-to-post network connected based on shared commenters and weighted by the average stance of all shared commenters across every pair of posts. We achieve 11% increase in the F1-score in detecting misinformative posts over state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments conducted on curated real-world Reddit data of over 200,000 posts demonstrate the superior performance of CrediRAG on existing baselines. Thus, our approach offers a more accurate and scalable solution to combat the spread of fake news across social media platforms.</description>

      <title>WorldCuisines: A Massive-Scale Benchmark for Multilingual and Multicultural Visual Question Answering on Global Cuisines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with culture-specific knowledge, particularly in languages other than English and in underrepresented cultural contexts. To evaluate their understanding of such knowledge, we introduce WorldCuisines, a massive-scale benchmark for multilingual and multicultural, visually grounded language understanding. This benchmark includes a visual question answering (VQA) dataset with text-image pairs across 30 languages and dialects, spanning 9 language families and featuring over 1 million data points, making it the largest multicultural VQA benchmark to date. It includes tasks for identifying dish names and their origins. We provide evaluation datasets in two sizes (12k and 60k instances) alongside a training dataset (1 million instances). Our findings show that while VLMs perform better with correct location context, they struggle with adversarial contexts and predicting specific regional cuisines and languages. To support future research, we release a knowledge base with annotated food entries and images along with the VQA data.</description>

      <title>VibeCheck: Discover and Quantify Qualitative Differences in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit subtle yet distinctive characteristics in their outputs that users intuitively recognize, but struggle to quantify. These "vibes" -- such as tone, formatting, or writing style -- influence user preferences, yet traditional evaluations focus primarily on the singular axis of correctness. We introduce VibeCheck, a system for automatically comparing a pair of LLMs by discovering identifying traits of a model (vibes) that are well-defined, differentiating, and user-aligned. VibeCheck iteratively discovers vibes from model outputs and then utilizes a panel of LLM judges to quantitatively measure the utility of each vibe. We validate that the vibes generated by VibeCheck align with those found in human discovery and run VibeCheck on pairwise preference data from real-world user conversations with Llama-3-70b vs GPT-4. VibeCheck reveals that Llama has a friendly, funny, and somewhat controversial vibe. These vibes predict model identity with 80% accuracy and human preference with 61% accuracy. Lastly, we run VibeCheck on a variety of models and tasks including summarization, math, and captioning to provide insight into differences in model behavior. VibeCheck discovers vibes like Command X prefers to add concrete intros and conclusions when summarizing in comparison to TNGL, Llama-405b often overexplains its thought process on math problems compared to GPT-4o, and GPT-4 prefers to focus on the mood and emotions of the scene when captioning compared to Gemini-1.5-Flash.

      <title>Multi-trait User Simulation with Adaptive Decoding for Conversational Task Assistants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conversational systems must be robust to user interactions that naturally exhibit diverse conversational traits. Capturing and simulating these diverse traits coherently and efficiently presents a complex challenge. This paper introduces Multi-Trait Adaptive Decoding (mTAD), a method that generates diverse user profiles at decoding-time by sampling from various trait-specific Language Models (LMs). mTAD provides an adaptive and scalable approach to user simulation, enabling the creation of multiple user profiles without the need for additional fine-tuning. By analyzing real-world dialogues from the Conversational Task Assistant (CTA) domain, we identify key conversational traits and developed a framework to generate profile-aware dialogues that enhance conversational diversity. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach in modeling single-traits using specialized LMs, which can capture less common patterns, even in out-of-domain tasks. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that mTAD is a robust and flexible framework for combining diverse user simulators.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Large Language Models in an Iterative Paradigm with Domain Feedback for Zero-shot Molecule Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13147v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecule optimization is a critical task in drug discovery to optimize desired properties of a given molecule through chemical modification. Despite Large Language Models (LLMs) holding the potential to efficiently simulate this task by using natural language to direct the optimization, straightforwardly utilizing shows limited performance. In this work, we facilitate utilizing LLMs in an iterative paradigm by proposing a simple yet highly effective domain feedback provider, namely $\text{Re}^2$DF. In detail, $\text{Re}^2$DF harnesses an external toolkit, RDKit, to handle the molecule hallucination, if the modified molecule is chemically invalid. Otherwise, its desired properties are computed and compared to the original one, establishing reliable domain feedback with correct direction and distance towards the objective, followed by a retrieved example, to explicitly guide the LLM to refine the modified molecule. We conduct experiments across both single- and multi-property objectives with 2 thresholds, where $\text{Re}^2$DF shows significant improvements. Particularly, for 20 single-property objectives, $\text{Re}^2$DF enhances Hit ratio by 16.95% and 20.76% under loose and strict thresholds, respectively. For 32 multi-property objectives, $\text{Re}^2$DF enhances Hit ratio by 6.04% and 5.25%.</description>

      <title>Extreme Precipitation Nowcasting using Multi-Task Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models have made remarkable strides in precipitation prediction, yet they continue to struggle with capturing the spatial details of the features of radar images, particularly over high precipitation intensity areas. This shortcoming is evident in the form of low forecast accuracy in the spatial positioning of radar echo images across varying precipitation intensity regions. To address this challenge, we introduce the multi-task latent diffusion model(MTLDM), a novel approach for precipitation prediction. The basic concept of the MTLDM is based on the understanding that the radar image representing precipitation is the result of multiple factors. Therefore, we adopt a divide-and-conquer approach, that is, we decompose the radar image using decomposition technology and then predict the decomposed sub-images separately. We conceptualize the precipitation image as a composition of various components corresponding to different precipitation intensities. The MTLDM decomposes the precipitation image into these distinct components and employs a dedicated task to predict each one. This method enables spatiotemporally consistent prediction of real-world precipitation areas up to 5-80 min in advance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques across multiple evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Assistive AI for Augmenting Human Decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regulatory frameworks for the use of AI are emerging. However, they trail behind the fast-evolving malicious AI technologies that can quickly cause lasting societal damage. In response, we introduce a pioneering Assistive AI framework designed to enhance human decision-making capabilities. This framework aims to establish a trust network across various fields, especially within legal contexts, serving as a proactive complement to ongoing regulatory efforts. Central to our framework are the principles of privacy, accountability, and credibility. In our methodology, the foundation of reliability of information and information sources is built upon the ability to uphold accountability, enhance security, and protect privacy. This approach supports, filters, and potentially guides communication, thereby empowering individuals and communities to make well-informed decisions based on cutting-edge advancements in AI. Our framework uses the concept of Boards as proxies to collectively ensure that AI-assisted decisions are reliable, accountable, and in alignment with societal values and legal standards. Through a detailed exploration of our framework, including its main components, operations, and sample use cases, the paper shows how AI can assist in the complex process of decision-making while maintaining human oversight. The proposed framework not only extends regulatory landscapes but also highlights the synergy between AI technology and human judgement, underscoring the potential of AI to serve as a vital instrument in discerning reality from fiction and thus enhancing the decision-making process. Furthermore, we provide domain-specific use cases to highlight the applicability of our framework.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithm Design (AD) is crucial for effective problem-solving across various domains. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has notably enhanced the automation and innovation within this field, offering new perspectives and promising solutions. Over the past three years, the integration of LLMs into AD (LLM4AD) has progressed significantly, finding applications in diverse areas such as optimization, machine learning, mathematical reasoning, and scientific discovery. Given the rapid development and broadening scope of this field, a systematic review is both timely and essential. This paper provides a systematic review of the works on LLM4AD. First, we present an overview and summary of existing studies. Then, we present a systematic taxonomy and a review of existing works along four dimensions, including the role of LLMs, search techniques, prompt strategies, and applications, with a discussion of the potential and achievements of using LLMs. Finally, we explore current challenges and propose several open questions and promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>A Distribution Semantics for Probabilistic Term Rewriting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic programming is becoming increasingly popular thanks to its ability to specify problems with a certain degree of uncertainty. In this work, we focus on term rewriting, a well-known computational formalism. In particular, we consider systems that combine traditional rewriting rules with probabilities. Then, we define a distribution semantics for such systems that can be used to model the probability of reducing a term to some value. We also show how to compute a set of "explanations" for a given reduction, which can be used to compute its probability. Finally, we illustrate our approach with several examples and outline a couple of extensions that may prove useful to improve the expressive power of probabilistic rewrite systems.</description>

      <title>WildOcc: A Benchmark for Off-Road 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is an essential part of autonomous driving, focusing on capturing the geometric details of scenes. Off-road environments are rich in geometric information, therefore it is suitable for 3D semantic occupancy prediction tasks to reconstruct such scenes. However, most of researches concentrate on on-road environments, and few methods are designed for off-road 3D semantic occupancy prediction due to the lack of relevant datasets and benchmarks. In response to this gap, we introduce WildOcc, to our knowledge, the first benchmark to provide dense occupancy annotations for off-road 3D semantic occupancy prediction tasks. A ground truth generation pipeline is proposed in this paper, which employs a coarse-to-fine reconstruction to achieve a more realistic result. Moreover, we introduce a multi-modal 3D semantic occupancy prediction framework, which fuses spatio-temporal information from multi-frame images and point clouds at voxel level. In addition, a cross-modality distillation function is introduced, which transfers geometric knowledge from point clouds to image features.</description>

      <title>TreeBoN: Enhancing Inference-Time Alignment with Speculative Tree-Search and Best-of-N Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inference-time alignment enhances the performance of large language models without requiring additional training or fine-tuning but presents challenges due to balancing computational efficiency with high-quality output. Best-of-N (BoN) sampling, as a simple yet powerful approach, generates multiple responses and selects the best one, achieving improved performance but with a high computational cost. We propose TreeBoN, a novel framework that integrates a speculative tree-search strategy into Best-of-N (BoN) Sampling. TreeBoN maintains a set of parent nodes, iteratively branching and pruning low-quality responses, thereby reducing computational overhead while maintaining high output quality. Our approach also leverages token-level rewards from Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to guide tree expansion and prune low-quality paths. We evaluate TreeBoN using AlpacaFarm, HH-RLHF, UltraFeedback, GSM8K, and TutorEval datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements. Specifically, TreeBoN achieves the highest win rate of 65% on TutorEval and around 60% win rates across other different datasets, outperforming standard BoN with the same computational cost and showcasing its scalability and alignment efficacy.</description>

      <title>Learning Precise, Contact-Rich Manipulation through Uncalibrated Tactile Skins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While visuomotor policy learning has advanced robotic manipulation, precisely executing contact-rich tasks remains challenging due to the limitations of vision in reasoning about physical interactions. To address this, recent work has sought to integrate tactile sensing into policy learning. However, many existing approaches rely on optical tactile sensors that are either restricted to recognition tasks or require complex dimensionality reduction steps for policy learning. In this work, we explore learning policies with magnetic skin sensors, which are inherently low-dimensional, highly sensitive, and inexpensive to integrate with robotic platforms. To leverage these sensors effectively, we present the Visuo-Skin (ViSk) framework, a simple approach that uses a transformer-based policy and treats skin sensor data as additional tokens alongside visual information. Evaluated on four complex real-world tasks involving credit card swiping, plug insertion, USB insertion, and bookshelf retrieval, ViSk significantly outperforms both vision-only and optical tactile sensing based policies. Further analysis reveals that combining tactile and visual modalities enhances policy performance and spatial generalization, achieving an average improvement of 27.5% across tasks. https://visuoskin.github.io/</description>

      <title>Rules, Cases, and Reasoning: Positivist Legal Theory as a Framework for Pluralistic AI Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17271v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Legal theory can address two related key problems of alignment: pluralism and specification. Alignment researchers must determine how to specify what is concretely meant by vague principles like helpfulness and fairness and they must ensure that their techniques do not exclude alternative perspectives on life and values. The law faces these same problems. Leading legal theories suggest the law solves these problems through the interaction of rules and cases, where general rules promulgated by a democratic authority are given specific content through their application over time. Concrete applications allow for convergence on practical meaning while preserving space for disagreement on values. These approaches suggest improvements to existing democratic alignment processes that use AI to create cases that give content to rules, allowing for more pluralist alignment.</description>

      <title>Scaling Robot Policy Learning via Zero-Shot Labeling with Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central challenge towards developing robots that can relate human language to their perception and actions is the scarcity of natural language annotations in diverse robot datasets. Moreover, robot policies that follow natural language instructions are typically trained on either templated language or expensive human-labeled instructions, hindering their scalability. To this end, we introduce NILS: Natural language Instruction Labeling for Scalability. NILS automatically labels uncurated, long-horizon robot data at scale in a zero-shot manner without any human intervention. NILS combines pretrained vision-language foundation models in order to detect objects in a scene, detect object-centric changes, segment tasks from large datasets of unlabelled interaction data and ultimately label behavior datasets. Evaluations on BridgeV2, Fractal, and a kitchen play dataset show that NILS can autonomously annotate diverse robot demonstrations of unlabeled and unstructured datasets while alleviating several shortcomings of crowdsourced human annotations, such as low data quality and diversity. We use NILS to label over 115k trajectories obtained from over 430 hours of robot data. We open-source our auto-labeling code and generated annotations on our website: http://robottasklabeling.github.io.</description>

      <title>Beyond position: how rotary embeddings shape representations and memory in autoregressive transfomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) enhance positional encoding in Transformer models, yet their full impact on model dynamics remains underexplored. This paper studies how RoPE introduces position-dependent rotations, causing phase shifts in token embeddings that influence higher-frequency components within the model's internal representations. Through spectral analysis, we demonstrate that RoPE's rotation matrices induce oscillatory behaviors in embeddings, affecting information retention across layers and shaping temporal modeling capabilities. We show that activation functions in feed-forward networks interact with RoPE-modulated embeddings to generate harmonics, leading to constructive or destructive interference based on phase alignment. Our findings reveal that phase alignment amplifies activations and sharpens attention, while misalignment weakens activations and disrupts focus on positional patterns. This study underscores the importance of frequency components as intrinsic elements of model behavior, offering new insights beyond traditional analyses.</description>

      <title>Fast Inference for Augmented Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance the capabilities of standalone LLMs by integrating external data sources through API calls. In interactive LLM applications, efficient scheduling is crucial for maintaining low request completion times, directly impacting user engagement. However, these augmentations introduce scheduling challenges due to the need to manage limited memory for cached information (KV caches). As a result, traditional size-based scheduling algorithms, such as Shortest Job First (SJF), become less effective at minimizing completion times. Existing work focuses only on handling requests during API calls by preserving, discarding, or swapping memory without considering how to schedule requests with API calls. In this paper, we propose LAMPS, a novel LLM inference framework for augmented LLMs. LAMPS minimizes request completion time through a unified scheduling approach that considers the total length of requests and their handling strategies during API calls. Recognizing that LLM inference is memory-bound, our approach ranks requests based on their consumption of memory over time, which depends on both the output sizes and how a request is managed during its API calls. To implement our scheduling, LAMPS predicts the strategy that minimizes memory waste of a request during its API calls, aligning with but improving upon existing approaches. We also propose starvation prevention techniques and optimizations to mitigate the overhead of our scheduling. We implement LAMPS on top of vLLM and evaluate its performance against baseline LLM inference systems, demonstrating improvements in end-to-end latency by 27%-85% and reductions in TTFT by 4%-96% compared to the existing augmented-LLM system, with even greater gains over vLLM.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Selective State-Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Transformer model has demonstrated success across a wide range of domains, including in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) where the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) has emerged as a leading algorithm in the field. However, a significant drawback of Transformer models is their quadratic computational complexity relative to input size, making them computationally expensive when scaling to larger inputs. This limitation restricts MAT's scalability in environments with many agents. Recently, State-Space Models (SSMs) have gained attention due to their computational efficiency, but their application in MARL remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the use of Mamba, a recent SSM, in MARL and assess whether it can match the performance of MAT while providing significant improvements in efficiency. We introduce a modified version of MAT that incorporates standard and bi-directional Mamba blocks, as well as a novel "cross-attention" Mamba block. Extensive testing shows that our Multi-Agent Mamba (MAM) matches the performance of MAT across multiple standard multi-agent environments, while offering superior scalability to larger agent scenarios. This is significant for the MARL community, because it indicates that SSMs could replace Transformers without compromising performance, whilst also supporting more effective scaling to higher numbers of agents.

      <title>NeuroClips: Towards High-fidelity and Smooth fMRI-to-Video Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstruction of static visual stimuli from non-invasion brain activity fMRI achieves great success, owning to advanced deep learning models such as CLIP and Stable Diffusion. However, the research on fMRI-to-video reconstruction remains limited since decoding the spatiotemporal perception of continuous visual experiences is formidably challenging. We contend that the key to addressing these challenges lies in accurately decoding both high-level semantics and low-level perception flows, as perceived by the brain in response to video stimuli. To the end, we propose NeuroClips, an innovative framework to decode high-fidelity and smooth video from fMRI. NeuroClips utilizes a semantics reconstructor to reconstruct video keyframes, guiding semantic accuracy and consistency, and employs a perception reconstructor to capture low-level perceptual details, ensuring video smoothness. During inference, it adopts a pre-trained T2V diffusion model injected with both keyframes and low-level perception flows for video reconstruction. Evaluated on a publicly available fMRI-video dataset, NeuroClips achieves smooth high-fidelity video reconstruction of up to 6s at 8FPS, gaining significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in various metrics, e.g., a 128% improvement in SSIM and an 81% improvement in spatiotemporal metrics.

      <title>LOCAL: Learning with Orientation Matrix to Infer Causal Structure from Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering the underlying Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from time series observational data is highly challenging due to the dynamic nature and complex nonlinear interactions between variables. Existing methods often struggle with inefficiency and the handling of high-dimensional data. To address these research gap, we propose LOCAL, a highly efficient, easy-to-implement, and constraint-free method for recovering dynamic causal structures. LOCAL is the first attempt to formulate a quasi-maximum likelihood-based score function for learning the dynamic DAG equivalent to the ground truth. On this basis, we propose two adaptive modules for enhancing the algebraic characterization of acyclicity with new capabilities: Asymptotic Causal Mask Learning (ACML) and Dynamic Graph Parameter Learning (DGPL). ACML generates causal masks using learnable priority vectors and the Gumbel-Sigmoid function, ensuring the creation of DAGs while optimizing computational efficiency. DGPL transforms causal learning into decomposed matrix products, capturing the dynamic causal structure of high-dimensional data and enhancing interpretability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that LOCAL significantly outperforms existing methods, and highlight LOCAL's potential as a robust and efficient method for dynamic causal discovery. Our code will be available soon.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models benefit from large datasets. Collecting data in biomedical domains is costly and challenging, hence, combining datasets has become a common practice. However, datasets obtained under different conditions could present undesired site-specific variability. Data harmonization methods aim to remove site-specific variance while retaining biologically relevant information. This study evaluates the effectiveness of popularly used ComBat-based methods for harmonizing data in scenarios where the class balance is not equal across sites. We find that these methods struggle with data leakage issues. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel approach PrettYharmonize, designed to harmonize data by pretending the target labels. We validate our approach using controlled datasets designed to benchmark the utility of harmonization. Finally, using real-world MRI and clinical data, we compare leakage-prone methods with PrettYharmonize and show that it achieves comparable performance while avoiding data leakage, particularly in site-target-dependence scenarios.</description>
