      <title>From Noise to Laws: Regularized Time-Series Forecasting via Denoised Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-horizon multivariate time-series forecasting is challenging because realistic predictions must (i) denoise heterogeneous signals, (ii) track time-varying cross-series dependencies, and (iii) remain stable and physically plausible over long rollout horizons. We present PRISM, which couples a score-based diffusion preconditioner with a dynamic, correlation-thresholded graph encoder and a forecast head regularized by generic physics penalties. We prove contraction of the induced horizon dynamics under mild conditions and derive Lipschitz bounds for graph blocks, explaining the model's robustness. On six standard benchmarks , PRISM achieves consistent SOTA with strong MSE and MAE gains.</description>

      <title>GRETEL: A Goal-driven Retrieval and Execution-based Trial Framework for LLM Tool Selection Enhancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in Large Language Model capabilities, tool retrieval for agent-based systems remains fundamentally limited by reliance on semantic similarity, which fails to capture functional viability. Current methods often retrieve textually relevant but functionally inoperative tools due to parameter mismatches, authentication failures, and execution constraints--a phenomenon we term the semantic-functional gap. We introduce GRETEL, to address this gap through systematic empirical validation. GRETEL implements an agentic workflow that processes semantically retrieved candidates through sandboxed plan-execute-evaluate cycles, generating execution-grounded evidence to distinguish truly functional tools from merely descriptive matches. Our comprehensive evaluation on the ToolBench benchmark demonstrates substantial improvements across all metrics: Pass Rate (at 10) increases from 0.690 to 0.826, Recall (at 10) improves from 0.841 to 0.867, and NDCG (at 10) rises from 0.807 to 0.857.. These results establish that execution-based validation provides a more reliable foundation for tool selection than semantic similarity alone, enabling more robust agent performance in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>CARLE: A Hybrid Deep-Shallow Learning Framework for Robust and Explainable RUL Estimation of Rolling Element Bearings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prognostic Health Management (PHM) systems monitor and predict equipment health. A key task is Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation, which predicts how long a component, such as a rolling element bearing, will operate before failure. Many RUL methods exist but often lack generalizability and robustness under changing operating conditions. This paper introduces CARLE, a hybrid AI framework that combines deep and shallow learning to address these challenges. CARLE uses Res-CNN and Res-LSTM blocks with multi-head attention and residual connections to capture spatial and temporal degradation patterns, and a Random Forest Regressor (RFR) for stable, accurate RUL prediction. A compact preprocessing pipeline applies Gaussian filtering for noise reduction and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for time-frequency feature extraction. We evaluate CARLE on the XJTU-SY and PRONOSTIA bearing datasets. Ablation studies measure each component's contribution, while noise and cross-domain experiments test robustness and generalization. Comparative results show CARLE outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, especially under dynamic conditions. Finally, we analyze model interpretability with LIME and SHAP to assess transparency and trustworthiness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive, physics aware deep learning framework for constructing fast and accurate surrogate models of rarefied, shock containing micro nozzle flows. The framework integrates three key components, a Fusion DeepONet operator learning architecture for capturing parameter dependencies, a physics-guided feature space that embeds a shock-aligned coordinate system, and a two-phase curriculum strategy emphasizing high-gradient regions. To demonstrate the generality and inductive bias of the proposed framework, we first validate it on the canonical viscous Burgers equation, which exhibits advective steepening and shock like gradients.</description>

      <title>MIN-Merging: Merge the Important Neurons for Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to a surge of open-source models across diverse domains. While model merging offers a promising way to combine their strengths, existing approaches often suffer from parameter conflicts that degrade performance on domain-specific tasks. We propose MIN-Merging, a router-based framework that selectively merges the most important neurons to reduce such conflicts. Extensive experiments on Computer Vision(CV) and Natural Language Processing(NLP) benchmarks show that MIN-Merging achieves consistent gains on in-domain tasks while retaining the generalization ability of pretrained models on out-of-domain tasks. These results highlight its effectiveness as a practical solution to the parameter conflict problem in model merging.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Federated Unlearning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world applications, raising concerns about privacy, security and the need to remove undesirable knowledge. Machine Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution, yet faces two key challenges: (1) practical unlearning needs are often continuous and heterogeneous, and (2) they involve decentralized, sensitive data with asymmetric access. These factors result in inter-domain and intra-domain interference, which further amplifies the dilemma of unbalanced forgetting and retaining performance. In response, we propose a federated unlearning approach for LLMs that is scalable and privacy preserving. Our method decouples unlearning and retention via task-specific adapter learning and employs a hierarchical merging strategy to mitigate conflicting objectives and enables robust, adaptable unlearning updates. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks of WMDP, MUSE, and TOFU showed that our approach effectively handles heterogeneous unlearning requests while maintaining strong LLM utility compared with baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Long-Context Attention Benchmark: From Kernel Efficiency to Distributed Context Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet their standard attention mechanism incurs quadratic computation and memory costs with respect to sequence length, posing a major bottleneck for long-context training. Prior work tackles this challenge along two directions: (1) kernel-level optimizations, which accelerate dense and sparse attention operators; and (2) module-level strategies, often referred to as distributed attention or context parallel training, which scale attention across multiple devices. However, systematic evaluation still remains limited: operator-level comparisons are often incomplete, while context parallel strategies are typically framework-specific, with unclear performance analysis across contexts. To address these gaps, we propose a unified benchmark that integrates representative attention kernels and context parallel mechanisms with a modular and extensible interface for evaluation. The benchmark evaluates methods along two critical dimensions: (1) attention mask patterns, which strongly affect efficiency, scalability, and usability, and (2) sequence length and distributed scale, which determine performance under extreme long-context training. Through comprehensive experiments on the cluster of up to 96 GPUs, our benchmark enables reproducible comparisons, highlights method-specific trade-offs, and provides practical guidance for designing and deploying attention mechanisms in long-context LLM training.</description>

      <title>L-MoE: End-to-End Training of a Lightweight Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture enables the scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) to trillions of parameters by activating a sparse subset of weights for each input, maintaining constant computational cost during inference. Concurrently, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant technique for parameter-efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on specialized tasks. In this work, we unify these two paradigms into a novel, end-to-end trainable framework named L-MoE: a Lightweight Mixture of LoRA Experts. L-MoE redefines MoE experts not as dense feed-forward networks, but as a collection of task-specialized, low-rank adapters. A lightweight gating network, trained jointly with the experts, learns to dynamically compose these LoRA adapters by computing a weighted average of their parameters for each input token. This composition is fully differentiable, allowing gradients from a standard auto-regressive language modeling objective to flow back through the entire architecture, simultaneously refining both the expert adapters and the routing strategy. This approach creates a highly parameter-efficient MoE model that is modular by design, allows for dynamic skill composition, and is trainable from end-to-end. We present the formal mathematical framework for L-MoE, detailing the differentiable routing mechanism and the joint optimization objective, thereby providing a new path toward building more efficient, scalable, and specialized language models.</description>

      <title>Automated Algorithm Design for Auto-Tuning Optimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is essential for optimizing high-performance applications, where vast and irregular parameter spaces make manual exploration infeasible. Traditionally, auto-tuning relies on well-established optimization algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms, annealing methods, or surrogate model-based optimizers to efficiently find near-optimal configurations. However, designing effective optimizers remains challenging, as no single method performs best across all tuning tasks.
  In this work, we explore a new paradigm: using large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate optimization algorithms tailored to auto-tuning problems. We introduce a framework that prompts LLMs with problem descriptions and search-space characteristics results to produce specialized optimization strategies, which are iteratively examined and improved.
  These generated algorithms are evaluated on four real-world auto-tuning applications across six hardware platforms and compared against the state-of-the-art in optimization algorithms of two contemporary auto-tuning frameworks. The evaluation demonstrates that providing additional application- and search space-specific information in the generation stage results in an average performance improvement of 30.7\% and 14.6\%, respectively. In addition, our results show that LLM-generated optimizers can rival, and in various cases outperform, existing human-designed algorithms, with our best-performing generated optimization algorithms achieving, on average, 72.4\% improvement over state-of-the-art optimizers for auto-tuning.</description>

      <title>The Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning Paradigm to Minimize the Number of Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative decentralized training across multiple parties (nodes) while keeping raw data private. There are two main paradigms in FL: Horizontal FL (HFL), where all participant nodes share the same feature space but hold different samples, and Vertical FL (VFL), where participants hold complementary features for the same samples. While HFL is widely adopted, VFL is employed in domains where nodes hold complementary features about the same samples. Still, VFL presents a significant limitation: the vast number of communications required during training. This compromises privacy and security, and can lead to high energy consumption, and in some cases, make model training unfeasible due to the high number of communications.
  In this paper, we introduce Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning (SBVFL), a novel paradigm that leverages a distributed training mechanism enhanced for privacy and security. Decoupling the vast majority of node updates from the server dramatically reduces node-server communication. Experiments show that SBVFL reduces communication by ~99% compared to standard VFL while maintaining accuracy and robustness. Therefore, SBVFL enables practical, privacy-preserving VFL across sensitive domains, including healthcare, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, cybersecurity, and the defense industry.</description>

      <title>NeuCo-Bench: A Novel Benchmark Framework for Neural Embeddings in Earth Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce NeuCo-Bench, a novel benchmark framework for evaluating (lossy) neural compression and representation learning in the context of Earth Observation (EO). Our approach builds on fixed-size embeddings that act as compact, task-agnostic representations applicable to a broad range of downstream tasks. NeuCo-Bench comprises three core components: (i) an evaluation pipeline built around reusable embeddings, (ii) a new challenge mode with a hidden-task leaderboard designed to mitigate pretraining bias, and (iii) a scoring system that balances accuracy and stability. To support reproducibility, we release SSL4EO-S12-downstream, a curated multispectral, multitemporal EO dataset. We present initial results from a public challenge at the 2025 CVPR EARTHVISION workshop and conduct ablations with state-of-the-art foundation models. NeuCo-Bench provides a first step towards community-driven, standardized evaluation of neural embeddings for EO and beyond.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Post-Hoc Calibration: Mitigating Confidently Incorrect Predictions Beyond Calibration Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on neural network calibration, existing methods typically apply global transformations that treat all predictions uniformly, overlooking the heterogeneous reliability of individual predictions. Furthermore, the relationship between improved calibration and effective uncertainty-aware decision-making remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a post-hoc calibration framework that leverages prediction reliability assessment to jointly enhance calibration quality and uncertainty-aware decision-making. The framework employs proximity-based conformal prediction to stratify calibration samples into putatively correct and putatively incorrect groups based on semantic similarity in feature space. A dual calibration strategy is then applied: standard isotonic regression calibrated confidence in putatively correct predictions, while underconfidence-regularized isotonic regression reduces confidence toward uniform distributions for putatively incorrect predictions, facilitating their identification for further investigations. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted using calibration metrics, uncertainty-aware performance measures, and empirical conformal coverage. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with BiT and CoAtNet backbones show that the proposed method achieves lower confidently incorrect predictions, and competitive Expected Calibration Error compared with isotonic and focal-loss baselines. This work bridges calibration and uncertainty quantification through instance-level adaptivity, offering a practical post-hoc solution that requires no model retraining while improving both probability alignment and uncertainty-aware decision-making.</description>

      <title>Data Unlearning Beyond Uniform Forgetting via Diffusion Time and Frequency Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training samples from a trained model without requiring full retraining. Unlike concept unlearning, data unlearning in diffusion models remains underexplored and often suffers from quality degradation or incomplete forgetting. To address this, we first observe that most existing methods attempt to unlearn the samples at all diffusion time steps equally, leading to poor-quality generation. We argue that forgetting occurs disproportionately across time and frequency, depending on the model and scenarios. By selectively focusing on specific time-frequency ranges during training, we achieve samples with higher aesthetic quality and lower noise. We validate this improvement by applying our time-frequency selective approach to diverse settings, including gradient-based and preference optimization objectives, as well as both image-level and text-to-image tasks. Finally, to evaluate both deletion and quality of unlearned data samples, we propose a simple normalized version of SSCD. Together, our analysis and methods establish a clearer understanding of the unique challenges in data unlearning for diffusion models, providing practical strategies to improve both evaluation and unlearning performance.</description>

      <title>Rewarding the Journey, Not Just the Destination: A Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring Reward Mechanism for Test-Time Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for advancing Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving remarkable performance in complex reasoning domains such as mathematics and code generation. However, current RL methods face a fundamental scalability bottleneck due to their heavy reliance on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. To overcome this limitation, we explore RL on unlabeled data where models learn autonomously from continuous experience streams. The core challenge in this setting lies in reliable reward estimation without ground-truth supervision. Existing approaches like Test-Time RL address this through self-consistent consensus, but risk reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels derived from majority voting. We introduce COMPASS (Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring), a novel test-time reward mechanism that operates without external supervision. COMPASS integrates two complementary components: the Dual-Calibration Answer Reward (DCAR), which stabilizes training by establishing trustworthy pseudo-labels through confidence and credibility calibration, and the Decisive Path Reward (DPR), which directly optimizes the reasoning process quality beyond mere outcome supervision. By jointly reinforcing trustworthy consensus answers and highly decisive reasoning chains, the COMPASS systematically enhances the model's analytical capabilities. Extensive experiments show that COMPASS achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks and model architectures, advancing a more scalable direction for LLMs to learn from continuous experience.</description>

Abstract: Reliable verifiable data has become a key driver of capability gains in modern language models, enabling stable reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards and effective distillation that transfers competence across math, coding, and agentic tasks. Yet constructing generalizable synthetic verifiable data remains difficult due to hallucination-prone generation, and weak or trivial verification artifacts that fail to separate strong from weak solutions. Existing approaches often rely on task-specific heuristics or post-hoc filters that do not transfer across domains and lack a principled, universal evaluator of verifiability. In this work, we introduce an evolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data synthesis framework that, from minimal seed supervision, jointly synthesizes problems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts, and iteratively discovers strategies via a consistency-based evaluator that enforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks. This pipeline upgrades filtering into principled synthesis: it reliably assembles coherent, verifiable training instances and generalizes without domain-specific rules. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under both RLVR and model distillation training paradigms. The results show that training with our synthesized data yields significant improvements on both the LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks, highlighting the robust generalization of our framework.</description>

      <title>From Observations to Parameters: Detecting Changepoint in Nonlinear Dynamics with Simulation-based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting regime shifts in chaotic time series is hard because observation-space signals are entangled with intrinsic variability. We propose Parameter--Space Changepoint Detection (Param--CPD), a two--stage framework that first amortizes Bayesian inference of governing parameters with a neural posterior estimator trained by simulation-based inference, and then applies a standard CPD algorithm to the resulting parameter trajectory. On Lorenz--63 with piecewise-constant parameters, Param--CPD improves F1, reduces localization error, and lowers false positives compared to observation--space baselines. We further verify identifiability and calibration of the inferred posteriors on stationary trajectories, explaining why parameter space offers a cleaner detection signal. Robustness analyses over tolerance, window length, and noise indicate consistent gains. Our results show that operating in a physically interpretable parameter space enables accurate and interpretable changepoint detection in nonlinear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Transition Matching: When and Why It Can Beat Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) underpins many state-of-the-art generative models, yet recent results indicate that Transition Matching (TM) can achieve higher quality with fewer sampling steps. This work answers the question of when and why TM outperforms FM. First, when the target is a unimodal Gaussian distribution, we prove that TM attains strictly lower KL divergence than FM for finite number of steps. The improvement arises from stochastic difference latent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM underestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM achieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing its advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis to Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the sampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM. The approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component means increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well separated. However, when the target variance approaches zero, each TM update converges to the FM update, and the performance advantage of TM diminishes. In summary, we show that TM outperforms FM when the target distribution has well-separated modes and non-negligible variances. We validate our theoretical results with controlled experiments on Gaussian distributions, and extend the comparison to real-world applications in image and video generation.</description>

      <title>Attention-Guided Deep Adversarial Temporal Subspace Clustering (A-DATSC) Model for multivariate spatiotemporal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep subspace clustering models are vital for applications such as snowmelt detection, sea ice tracking, crop health monitoring, infectious disease modeling, network load prediction, and land-use planning, where multivariate spatiotemporal data exhibit complex temporal dependencies and reside on multiple nonlinear manifolds beyond the capability of traditional clustering methods. These models project data into a latent space where samples lie in linear subspaces and exploit the self-expressiveness property to uncover intrinsic relationships. Despite their success, existing methods face major limitations: they use shallow autoencoders that ignore clustering errors, emphasize global features while neglecting local structure, fail to model long-range dependencies and positional information, and are rarely applied to 4D spatiotemporal data. To address these issues, we propose A-DATSC (Attention-Guided Deep Adversarial Temporal Subspace Clustering), a model combining a deep subspace clustering generator and a quality-verifying discriminator. The generator, inspired by U-Net, preserves spatial and temporal integrity through stacked TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D layers, reducing parameters and enhancing generalization. A graph attention transformer based self-expressive network captures local spatial relationships, global dependencies, and both short- and long-range correlations. Experiments on three real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets show that A-DATSC achieves substantially superior clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art deep subspace clustering models.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting Models on Neural Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural activity forecasting is central to understanding neural systems and enabling closed-loop control. While deep learning has recently advanced the state-of-the-art in the time series forecasting literature, its application to neural activity forecasting remains limited. To bridge this gap, we systematically evaluated eight probabilistic deep learning models, including two foundation models, that have demonstrated strong performance on general forecasting benchmarks. We compared them against four classical statistical models and two baseline methods on spontaneous neural activity recorded from mouse cortex via widefield imaging. Across prediction horizons, several deep learning models consistently outperformed classical approaches, with the best model producing informative forecasts up to 1.5 seconds into the future. Our findings point toward future control applications and open new avenues for probing the intrinsic temporal structure of neural activity.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Long-Term Forecasting: Radiation Dose from Sparse Neutron Sensor via Spatio-Temporal Operator Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting unobservable physical quantities from sparse, cross-domain sensor data is a central unsolved problem in scientific machine learning. Existing neural operators and large-scale forecasters rely on dense, co-located input-output fields and short temporal contexts, assumptions that fail in real-world systems where sensing and prediction occur on distinct physical manifolds and over long timescales. We introduce the Spatio-Temporal Operator Network (STONe), a non-autoregressive neural operator that learns a stable functional mapping between heterogeneous domains. By directly inferring high-altitude radiation dose fields from sparse ground-based neutron measurements, STONe demonstrates that operator learning can generalize beyond shared-domain settings. It defines a nonlinear operator between sensor and target manifolds that remains stable over long forecasting horizons without iterative recurrence. This challenges the conventional view that operator learning requires domain alignment or autoregressive propagation. Trained on 23 years of global neutron data, STONe achieves accurate 180-day forecasts with millisecond inference latency. The framework establishes a general principle for cross-domain operator inference, enabling real-time prediction of complex spatiotemporal fields in physics, climate, and energy systems.</description>

      <title>Measure-Theoretic Anti-Causal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal representation learning in the anti-causal setting (labels cause features rather than the reverse) presents unique challenges requiring specialized approaches. We propose Anti-Causal Invariant Abstractions (ACIA), a novel measure-theoretic framework for anti-causal representation learning. ACIA employs a two-level design, low-level representations capture how labels generate observations, while high-level representations learn stable causal patterns across environment-specific variations. ACIA addresses key limitations of existing approaches by accommodating prefect and imperfect interventions through interventional kernels, eliminating dependency on explicit causal structures, handling high-dimensional data effectively, and providing theoretical guarantees for out-of-distribution generalization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that ACIA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and invariance metrics. Furthermore, our theoretical results establish tight bounds on performance gaps between training and unseen environments, confirming the efficacy of our approach for robust anti-causal learning.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Divergence Regularized Policy Optimization for Fine-tuning Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation during reinforcement learning fine-tuning of generative models presents a critical challenge, as existing approaches rely on fixed divergence regularization that creates an inherent dilemma: strong regularization preserves model capabilities but limits reward optimization, while weak regularization enables greater alignment but risks instability or reward hacking. We introduce Adaptive Divergence Regularized Policy Optimization (ADRPO), which automatically adjusts regularization strength based on advantage estimates-reducing regularization for high-value samples while applying stronger regularization to poor samples, enabling policies to navigate between exploration and aggressive exploitation according to data quality. Our implementation with Wasserstein-2 regularization for flow matching generative models achieves remarkable results on text-to-image generation, achieving better semantic alignment and diversity than offline methods like DPO and online methods with fixed regularization like ORW-CFM-W2. ADRPO enables a 2B parameter SD3 model to surpass much larger models with 4.8B and 12B parameters in attribute binding, semantic consistency, artistic style transfer, and compositional control while maintaining generation diversity. ADRPO generalizes to KL-regularized fine-tuning of both text-only LLMs and multi-modal reasoning models, enhancing existing online RL methods like GRPO. In LLM fine-tuning, ADRPO demonstrates an emergent ability to escape local optima through active exploration, while in multi-modal audio reasoning, it outperforms GRPO through superior step-by-step reasoning, enabling a 7B model to outperform substantially larger commercial models including Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, offering an effective plug-and-play solution to the exploration-exploitation challenge across diverse generative architectures and modalities.</description>

      <title>SPACeR: Self-Play Anchoring with Centralized Reference Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires not only safety and efficiency, but also realistic, human-like behaviors that are socially aware and predictable. Achieving this requires sim agent policies that are human-like, fast, and scalable in multi-agent settings. Recent progress in imitation learning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that behaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic policies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during inference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In contrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and naturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics and reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We propose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide decentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL divergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while preserving RL scalability. Evaluated on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, our method achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies while being up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than large generative models. In addition, we demonstrate in closed-loop ego planning evaluation tasks that our sim agents can effectively measure planner quality with fast and scalable traffic simulation, establishing a new paradigm for testing autonomous driving policies.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning Flow Matching Generative Models with Intermediate Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow-based generative models have shown remarkable success in text-to-image generation, yet fine-tuning them with intermediate feedback remains challenging, especially for continuous-time flow matching models. Most existing approaches solely learn from outcome rewards, struggling with the credit assignment problem. Alternative methods that attempt to learn a critic via direct regression on cumulative rewards often face training instabilities and model collapse in online settings. We present AC-Flow, a robust actor-critic framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1) reward shaping that provides well-normalized learning signals to enable stable intermediate value learning and gradient control, (2) a novel dual-stability mechanism that combines advantage clipping to prevent destructive policy updates with a warm-up phase that allows the critic to mature before influencing the actor, and (3) a scalable generalized critic weighting scheme that extends traditional reward-weighted methods while preserving model diversity through Wasserstein regularization. Through extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 3, we demonstrate that AC-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image alignment tasks and generalization to unseen human preference models. Our results demonstrate that even with a computationally efficient critic model, we can robustly finetune flow models without compromising generative quality, diversity, or stability.</description>

      <title>R2L: Reliable Reinforcement Learning: Guaranteed Return &amp; Reliable Policies in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of determining reliable policies in reinforcement learning (RL), with a focus on optimization under uncertainty and the need for performance guarantees. While classical RL algorithms aim at maximizing the expected return, many real-world applications - such as routing, resource allocation, or sequential decision-making under risk - require strategies that ensure not only high average performance but also a guaranteed probability of success. To this end, we propose a novel formulation in which the objective is to maximize the probability that the cumulative return exceeds a prescribed threshold. We demonstrate that this reliable RL problem can be reformulated, via a state-augmented representation, into a standard RL problem, thereby allowing the use of existing RL and deep RL algorithms without the need for entirely new algorithmic frameworks. Theoretical results establish the equivalence of the two formulations and show that reliable strategies can be derived by appropriately adapting well-known methods such as Q-learning or Dueling Double DQN. To illustrate the practical relevance of the approach, we consider the problem of reliable routing, where the goal is not to minimize the expected travel time but rather to maximize the probability of reaching the destination within a given time budget. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed formulation leads to policies that effectively balance efficiency and reliability, highlighting the potential of reliable RL for applications in stochastic and safety-critical environments.</description>

      <title>Batch Distillation Data for Developing Machine Learning Anomaly Detection Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) holds great potential to advance anomaly detection (AD) in chemical processes. However, the development of ML-based methods is hindered by the lack of openly available experimental data. To address this gap, we have set up a laboratory-scale batch distillation plant and operated it to generate an extensive experimental database, covering fault-free experiments and experiments in which anomalies were intentionally induced, for training advanced ML-based AD methods. In total, 119 experiments were conducted across a wide range of operating conditions and mixtures. Most experiments containing anomalies were paired with a corresponding fault-free one. The database that we provide here includes time-series data from numerous sensors and actuators, along with estimates of measurement uncertainty. In addition, unconventional data sources -- such as concentration profiles obtained via online benchtop NMR spectroscopy and video and audio recordings -- are provided. Extensive metadata and expert annotations of all experiments are included. The anomaly annotations are based on an ontology developed in this work. The data are organized in a structured database and made freely available via doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17395544. This new database paves the way for the development of advanced ML-based AD methods. As it includes information on the causes of anomalies, it further enables the development of interpretable and explainable ML approaches, as well as methods for anomaly mitigation.</description>

      <title>MEG-GPT: A transformer-based foundation model for magnetoencephalography data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling the complex spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale brain dynamics is crucial for neuroscience, but traditional methods fail to capture the rich structure in modalities such as magnetoencephalography (MEG). Recent advances in deep learning have enabled significant progress in other domains, such as language and vision, by using foundation models at scale. Here, we introduce MEG-GPT, a transformer based foundation model that uses time-attention and next time-point prediction. To facilitate this, we also introduce a novel data-driven tokeniser for continuous MEG data, which preserves the high temporal resolution of continuous MEG signals without lossy transformations. We trained MEG-GPT on tokenised brain region time-courses extracted from a large-scale MEG dataset (N=612, eyes-closed rest, Cam-CAN data), and show that the learnt model can generate data with realistic spatio-spectral properties, including transient events and population variability. Critically, it performs well in downstream decoding tasks, improving downstream supervised prediction task, showing improved zero-shot generalisation across sessions (improving accuracy from 0.54 to 0.59) and subjects (improving accuracy from 0.41 to 0.49) compared to a baseline methods. Furthermore, we show the model can be efficiently fine-tuned on a smaller labelled dataset to boost performance in cross-subject decoding scenarios. This work establishes a powerful foundation model for electrophysiological data, paving the way for applications in computational neuroscience and neural decoding.</description>

      <title>Any-Depth Alignment: Unlocking Innate Safety Alignment of LLMs to Any-Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong but shallow alignment: they directly refuse harmful queries when a refusal is expected at the very start of an assistant turn, yet this protection collapses once a harmful continuation is underway (either through the adversarial attacks or via harmful assistant-prefill attacks). This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate shallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation depths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an effective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based on our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header tokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens possess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens mid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals at any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety performance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It secures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill attacks ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens. Furthermore, ADA reduces the average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR, and TAP) to below 3%. This is all accomplished while preserving utility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal. ADA maintains this resilience even after the base model undergoes subsequent instruction tuning (benign or adversarial).</description>

      <title>Provably Optimal Reinforcement Learning under Safety Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) enable its use on increasingly complex tasks, but the lack of formal safety guarantees still limits its application in safety-critical settings. A common practical approach is to augment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to prevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering is often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning process. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not inherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a sufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance. We formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP), which requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of catastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP in which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is considered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that (i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL convergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is optimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the same asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a complete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization. We validate the theory on Safety Gymnasium with representative tasks and constraints, observing zero violations during training and final performance matching or exceeding unfiltered baselines. Together, these results shed light on a long-standing question in safety-filtered learning and provide a simple, principled recipe for safe RL: train and deploy RL policies with the most permissive safety filter that is available.</description>

      <title>Enhancing mortality prediction in cardiac arrest ICU patients through meta-modeling of structured clinical data from MIMIC-IV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate early prediction of in-hospital mortality in intensive care units (ICUs) is essential for timely clinical intervention and efficient resource allocation. This study develops and evaluates machine learning models that integrate both structured clinical data and unstructured textual information, specifically discharge summaries and radiology reports, from the MIMIC-IV database. We used LASSO and XGBoost for feature selection, followed by a multivariate logistic regression trained on the top features identified by both models. Incorporating textual features using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings significantly improved predictive performance. The final logistic regression model, which combined structured and textual input, achieved an AUC of 0.918, compared to 0.753 when using structured data alone, a relative improvement 22%. The analysis of the decision curve demonstrated a superior standardized net benefit in a wide range of threshold probabilities (0.2-0.8), confirming the clinical utility of the model. These results underscore the added prognostic value of unstructured clinical notes and support their integration into interpretable feature-driven risk prediction models for ICU patients.</description>

      <title>Latent Discrete Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study discrete diffusion for language and other categorical data and focus on a common limitation of masked denoisers: reverse transitions typically factorize across positions, which can weaken joint structure and degrade quality in few-step generation. We propose \emph{Latent Discrete Diffusion Models} (LDDMs), which couple a masked discrete diffusion over tokens with a continuous diffusion over latent embeddings. The latent channel provides a softer signal and carries cross-token dependencies that help resolve ambiguities. We present two instantiations: (i) FUJI-LDDMs, which perform fully joint denoising of tokens and latents, and (ii) SEQ-LDDMs, which sequentially resolve the latent and then the discrete chain conditionally on it. For both variants we derive ELBO-style objectives and discuss design choices to learn informative latents yet amenable to diffusoin modeling. In experiments, LDDMs yield improvements on unconditional generation metrics as compared to state-of-the-art masked discrete diffusion baselines, and are effective at lower sampling budgets, where unmasking many tokens per step is desirable.</description>

      <title>Gradient Variance Reveals Failure Modes in Flow-Based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rectified Flows learn ODE vector fields whose trajectories are straight between source and target distributions, enabling near one-step inference. We show that this straight-path objective conceals fundamental failure modes: under deterministic training, low gradient variance drives memorization of arbitrary training pairings, even when interpolant lines between pairs intersect. To analyze this mechanism, we study Gaussian-to-Gaussian transport and use the loss gradient variance across stochastic and deterministic regimes to characterize which vector fields optimization favors in each setting. We then show that, in a setting where all interpolating lines intersect, applying Rectified Flow yields the same specific pairings at inference as during training. More generally, we prove that a memorizing vector field exists even when training interpolants intersect, and that optimizing the straight-path objective converges to this ill-defined field. At inference, deterministic integration reproduces the exact training pairings. We validate our findings empirically on the CelebA dataset, confirming that deterministic interpolants induce memorization, while the injection of small noise restores generalization.</description>

      <title>Efficient Long-context Language Model Training by Core Attention Disaggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present core attention disaggregation (CAD), a technique that improves long-context large language model training by decoupling the core attention computation, softmax(QK^T)V, from the rest of the model and executing it on a separate pool of devices. In existing systems, core attention is colocated with other layers; at long context lengths, its quadratic compute growth compared to the near-linear growth of other components causes load imbalance and stragglers across data and pipeline parallel groups. CAD is enabled by two observations. First, core attention is stateless: it has no trainable parameters and only minimal transient data, so balancing reduces to scheduling compute-bound tasks. Second, it is composable: modern attention kernels retain high efficiency when processing fused batches of token-level shards with arbitrary lengths. CAD partitions core attention into token-level tasks and dispatches them to dedicated attention servers, which dynamically rebatch tasks to equalize compute without sacrificing kernel efficiency. We implement CAD in a system called DistCA, which uses a ping-pong execution scheme to fully overlap communication with computation and in-place execution on attention servers to reduce memory use. On 512 H200 GPUs and context lengths up to 512k tokens, DistCA improves end-to-end training throughput by up to 1.35x, eliminates data and pipeline parallel stragglers, and achieves near-perfect compute and memory balance.</description>

      <title>HyperDiffusionFields (HyDiF): Diffusion-Guided Hypernetworks for Learning Implicit Molecular Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce HyperDiffusionFields (HyDiF), a framework that models 3D molecular conformers as continuous fields rather than discrete atomic coordinates or graphs. At the core of our approach is the Molecular Directional Field (MDF), a vector field that maps any point in space to the direction of the nearest atom of a particular type. We represent MDFs using molecule-specific neural implicit fields, which we call Molecular Neural Fields (MNFs). To enable learning across molecules and facilitate generalization, we adopt an approach where a shared hypernetwork, conditioned on a molecule, generates the weights of the given molecule's MNF. To endow the model with generative capabilities, we train the hypernetwork as a denoising diffusion model, enabling sampling in the function space of molecular fields. Our design naturally extends to a masked diffusion mechanism to support structure-conditioned generation tasks, such as molecular inpainting, by selectively noising regions of the field. Beyond generation, the localized and continuous nature of MDFs enables spatially fine-grained feature extraction for molecular property prediction, something not easily achievable with graph or point cloud based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach scales to larger biomolecules, illustrating a promising direction for field-based molecular modeling.</description>

      <title>Rethinking PCA Through Duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently shown connection between self-attention and (kernel) principal component analysis (PCA), we revisit the fundamentals of PCA. Using the difference-of-convex (DC) framework, we present several novel formulations and provide new theoretical insights. In particular, we show the kernelizability and out-of-sample applicability for a PCA-like family of problems. Moreover, we uncover that simultaneous iteration, which is connected to the classical QR algorithm, is an instance of the difference-of-convex algorithm (DCA), offering an optimization perspective on this longstanding method. Further, we describe new algorithms for PCA and empirically compare them with state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we introduce a kernelizable dual formulation for a robust variant of PCA that minimizes the $l_1$ deviation of the reconstruction errors.</description>

      <title>Nash Policy Gradient: A Policy Gradient Method with Iteratively Refined Regularization for Finding Nash Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding Nash equilibria in imperfect-information games remains a central challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. While regularization-based methods have recently achieved last-iteration convergence to a regularized equilibrium, they require the regularization strength to shrink toward zero to approximate a Nash equilibrium, often leading to unstable learning in practice. Instead, we fix the regularization strength at a large value for robustness and achieve convergence by iteratively refining the reference policy. Our main theoretical result shows that this procedure guarantees strictly monotonic improvement and convergence to an exact Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum games, without requiring a uniqueness assumption. Building on this framework, we develop a practical algorithm, Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG), which preserves the generalizability of policy gradient methods while relying solely on the current and reference policies. Empirically, NashPG achieves comparable or lower exploitability than prior model-free methods on classic benchmark games and scales to large domains such as Battleship and No-Limit Texas Hold'em, where NashPG consistently attains higher Elo ratings.</description>

      <title>ActivationReasoning: Logical Reasoning in Latent Activation Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text, but their internal reasoning remains opaque and difficult to control. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) make hidden activations more interpretable by exposing latent features that often align with human concepts. Yet, these features are fragile and passive, offering no mechanism for systematic reasoning or model control. To address this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds explicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three stages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept representations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a dictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects activating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical reasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order structures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior. We evaluate AR on multi-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept cues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA), and context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails). Across all tasks, AR scales robustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract and context-sensitive tasks, and transfers across model backbones. These results demonstrate that grounding logical structure in latent activations not only improves transparency but also enables structured reasoning, reliable control, and alignment with desired behaviors, providing a path toward more reliable and auditable AI.</description>

      <title>Ensemble based Closed-Loop Optimal Control using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of designing a control system is to steer a dynamical system with a control signal, guiding it to exhibit the desired behavior. The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation offers a framework for optimal control system design. However, numerical solutions to this equation are computationally intensive, and analytical solutions are frequently unavailable. Knowledge-guided machine learning methodologies, such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), offer new alternative approaches that can alleviate the difficulties of solving the HJB equation numerically. This work presents a multistage ensemble framework to learn the optimal cost-to-go, and subsequently the corresponding optimal control signal, through the HJB equation. Prior PINN-based approaches rely on a stabilizing the HJB enforcement during training. Our framework does not use stabilizer terms and offers a means of controlling the nonlinear system, via either a singular learned control signal or an ensemble control signal policy. Success is demonstrated in closed-loop control, using both ensemble- and singular-control, of a steady-state time-invariant two-state continuous nonlinear system with an infinite time horizon, accounting of noisy, perturbed system states and varying initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Cooperation Efficiency and Communication Covertness for Target Detection with AUVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates underwater cooperative target detection using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), with a focus on the critical trade-off between cooperation efficiency and communication covertness. To tackle this challenge, we first formulate a joint trajectory and power control optimization problem, and then present an innovative hierarchical action management framework to solve it. According to the hierarchical formulation, at the macro level, the master AUV models the agent selection process as a Markov decision process and deploys the proximal policy optimization algorithm for strategic task allocation. At the micro level, each selected agent's decentralized decision-making is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process, and a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to dynamically adjust its trajectory and transmission power based on its local observations. Under the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm, our target detection framework enables adaptive covert cooperation while satisfying both energy and mobility constraints. By comprehensively modeling the considered system, the involved signals and tasks, as well as energy consumption, theoretical insights and practical solutions for the efficient and secure operation of multiple AUVs are provided, offering significant implications for the execution of underwater covert communication tasks.</description>

      <title>Towards Fast LLM Fine-tuning through Zeroth-Order Optimization with Projected Gradient-Aligned Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods due to its reduced memory footprint requirement. However, existing ZO methods suffer from high variance in gradient estimation, leading to slow convergence and suboptimal performance on large-scale models. In this work, we propose P-GAP, a fast LLM fine-tuning approach through zeroth-order optimization with Projected Gradient-Aligned Perturbations. Specifically, we first estimate a low-dimensional gradient space and then align perturbations in projected gradients' direction within the space. This approach enables reduced the number of perturbed parameters and decreased variance, therefore accelerated convergence for LLM fine-tuning. Experiments on LLMs show that P-GAP consistently surpasses the baselines, achieving up to 6% increase in accuracy on classification tasks and up to 12% higher accuracy on generation tasks, with up to about 81% less training iterations and 70% less GPU hours. These results demonstrate that P-GAP enables fast, scalable, and resource-efficient ZO LLM fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>ACTG-ARL: Differentially Private Conditional Text Generation with RL-Boosted Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic text under differential privacy (DP) is critical for training and evaluating language models without compromising user privacy. Prior work on synthesizing DP datasets often fail to preserve key statistical attributes, suffer utility loss from the noise required by DP, and lack fine-grained control over generation. To address these challenges, we make two contributions. First, we introduce a hierarchical framework that decomposes DP synthetic text generation into two subtasks: feature learning and conditional text generation. This design explicitly incorporates learned features into the generation process and simplifies the end-to-end synthesis task. Through systematic ablations, we identify the most effective configuration: a rich tabular schema as feature, a DP tabular synthesizer, and a DP fine-tuned conditional generator, which we term ACTG (Attribute-Conditioned Text Generation). Second, we propose Anchored RL (ARL), a post-training method that improves the instruction-following ability of ACTG for conditional generation. ARL combines RL to boost control with an SFT anchor on best-of-$N$ data to prevent reward hacking. Together, these components form our end-to-end algorithm ACTG-ARL, which advances both the quality of DP synthetic text (+20% MAUVE over prior work) and the control of the conditional generator under strong privacy guarantees.</description>

      <title>Fostering the Ecosystem of AI for Social Impact Requires Expanding and Strengthening Evaluation Standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been increasing research interest in AI/ML for social impact, and correspondingly more publication venues have refined review criteria for practice-driven AI/ML research. However, these review guidelines tend to most concretely recognize projects that simultaneously achieve deployment and novel ML methodological innovation. We argue that this introduces incentives for researchers that undermine the sustainability of a broader research ecosystem of social impact, which benefits from projects that make contributions on single front (applied or methodological) that may better meet project partner needs. Our position is that researchers and reviewers in machine learning for social impact must simultaneously adopt: 1) a more expansive conception of social impacts beyond deployment and 2) more rigorous evaluations of the impact of deployed systems.</description>

      <title>Learning with Dual-level Noisy Correspondence for Multi-modal Entity Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities across heterogeneous multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs), where each entity is described by attributes from various modalities. Existing methods typically assume that both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences are faultless, which is often violated in real-world MMKGs due to the reliance on expert annotations. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly practical yet under-explored problem in MMEA, termed Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC). DNC refers to misalignments in both intra-entity (entity-attribute) and inter-graph (entity-entity and attribute-attribute) correspondences. To address the DNC problem, we propose a robust MMEA framework termed RULE. RULE first estimates the reliability of both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences via a dedicated two-fold principle. Leveraging the estimated reliabilities, RULE mitigates the negative impact of intra-entity noise during attribute fusion and prevents overfitting to noisy inter-graph correspondences during inter-graph discrepancy elimination. Beyond the training-time designs, RULE further incorporates a correspondence reasoning module that uncovers the underlying attribute-attribute connection across graphs, guaranteeing more accurate equivalent entity identification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method against the DNC compared with seven state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at \href{https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/RULE}{XLearning-SCU/RULE}</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws Meet Model Architecture: Toward Inference-Efficient LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling the number of parameters and the size of training data has proven to be an effective strategy for improving large language model (LLM) performance. Yet, as these models grow increasingly powerful and widely deployed, the cost of inference has become a pressing concern. Despite its importance, the trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency remains underexplored. In this work, we examine how key architectural factors, hidden size, the allocation of parameters between MLP and attention (mlp-to-attention ratio), and grouped-query attention (GQA), influence both inference cost and accuracy. We introduce a conditional scaling law that augments the Chinchilla framework with architectural information, along with a search framework for identifying architectures that are simultaneously inference-efficient and accurate. To validate our approach, we train more than 200 models spanning 80M to 3B parameters and 8B to 100B training tokens, and fit the proposed conditional scaling law. Our results show that the conditional scaling law reliably predicts optimal architectural choices and that the resulting models outperform existing open-source baselines. Under the same training budget, optimized architectures achieve up to 2.1% higher accuracy and 42% greater inference throughput compared to LLaMA-3.2.</description>

      <title>NTKMTL: Mitigating Task Imbalance in Multi-Task Learning from Neural Tangent Kernel Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables a single model to learn multiple tasks simultaneously, leveraging knowledge transfer among tasks for enhanced generalization, and has been widely applied across various domains. However, task imbalance remains a major challenge in MTL. Although balancing the convergence speeds of different tasks is an effective approach to address this issue, it is highly challenging to accurately characterize the training dynamics and convergence speeds of multiple tasks within the complex MTL system. To this end, we attempt to analyze the training dynamics in MTL by leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory and propose a new MTL method, NTKMTL. Specifically, we introduce an extended NTK matrix for MTL and adopt spectral analysis to balance the convergence speeds of multiple tasks, thereby mitigating task imbalance. Based on the approximation via shared representation, we further propose NTKMTL-SR, achieving training efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks, including both multi-task supervised learning and multi-task reinforcement learning.

      <title>From Competition to Synergy: Unlocking Reinforcement Learning for Subject-Driven Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subject-driven image generation models face a fundamental trade-off between identity preservation (fidelity) and prompt adherence (editability). While online reinforcement learning (RL), specifically GPRO, offers a promising solution, we find that a naive application of GRPO leads to competitive degradation, as the simple linear aggregation of rewards with static weights causes conflicting gradient signals and a misalignment with the temporal dynamics of the diffusion process. To overcome these limitations, we propose Customized-GRPO, a novel framework featuring two key innovations: (i) Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping (SARS), a non-linear mechanism that explicitly penalizes conflicted reward signals and amplifies synergistic ones, providing a sharper and more decisive gradient. (ii) Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting (TDW), which aligns the optimization pressure with the model's temporal dynamics by prioritizing prompt-following in the early, identity preservation in the later. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms naive GRPO baselines, successfully mitigating competitive degradation. Our model achieves a superior balance, generating images that both preserve key identity features and accurately adhere to complex textual prompts.</description>

      <title>Online Time Series Forecasting with Theoretical Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with online time series forecasting, where unknown distribution shifts occur over time, i.e., latent variables influence the mapping from historical to future observations. To develop an automated way of online time series forecasting, we propose a Theoretical framework for Online Time-series forecasting (TOT in short) with theoretical guarantees. Specifically, we prove that supplying a forecaster with latent variables tightens the Bayes risk, the benefit endures under estimation uncertainty of latent variables and grows as the latent variables achieve a more precise identifiability. To better introduce latent variables into online forecasting algorithms, we further propose to identify latent variables with minimal adjacent observations. Based on these results, we devise a model-agnostic blueprint by employing a temporal decoder to match the distribution of observed variables and two independent noise estimators to model the causal inference of latent variables and mixing procedures of observed variables, respectively. Experiment results on synthetic data support our theoretical claims. Moreover, plug-in implementations built on several baselines yield general improvement across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Parametric Bandits for Beam Alignment in mmWave Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, beam alignment and tracking are crucial to combat the significant path loss. As scanning the entire directional space is inefficient, designing an efficient and robust method to identify the optimal beam directions is essential. Since traditional bandit algorithms require a long time horizon to converge under large beam spaces, many existing works propose efficient bandit algorithms for beam alignment by relying on unimodality or multimodality assumptions on the reward function's structure. However, such assumptions often do not hold (or cannot be strictly satisfied) in practice, which causes such algorithms to converge to choosing suboptimal beams.
  In this work, we propose two physics-informed bandit algorithms \textit{pretc} and \textit{prgreedy} that exploit the sparse multipath property of mmWave channels - a generic but realistic assumption - which is connected to the Phase Retrieval Bandit problem. Our algorithms treat the parameters of each path as black boxes and maintain optimal estimates of them based on sampled historical rewards. \textit{pretc} starts with a random exploration phase and then commits to the optimal beam under the estimated reward function. \textit{prgreedy} performs such estimation in an online manner and chooses the best beam under current estimates. Our algorithms can also be easily adapted to beam tracking in the mobile setting. Through experiments using both the synthetic DeepMIMO dataset and the real-world DeepSense6G dataset, we demonstrate that both algorithms outperform existing approaches in a wide range of scenarios across diverse channel environments, showing their generalizability and robustness.</description>

      <title>Towards Identifiability of Hierarchical Temporal Causal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling hierarchical latent dynamics behind time series data is critical for capturing temporal dependencies across multiple levels of abstraction in real-world tasks. However, existing temporal causal representation learning methods fail to capture such dynamics, as they fail to recover the joint distribution of hierarchical latent variables from \textit{single-timestep observed variables}. Interestingly, we find that the joint distribution of hierarchical latent variables can be uniquely determined using three conditionally independent observations. Building on this insight, we propose a Causally Hierarchical Latent Dynamic (CHiLD) identification framework. Our approach first employs temporal contextual observed variables to identify the joint distribution of multi-layer latent variables. Sequentially, we exploit the natural sparsity of the hierarchical structure among latent variables to identify latent variables within each layer. Guided by the theoretical results, we develop a time series generative model grounded in variational inference. This model incorporates a contextual encoder to reconstruct multi-layer latent variables and normalize flow-based hierarchical prior networks to impose the independent noise condition of hierarchical latent dynamics. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of CHiLD in modeling hierarchical latent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Higher Embedding Dimension Creates a Stronger World Model for a Simple Sorting Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how embedding dimension affects the emergence of an internal "world model" in a transformer trained with reinforcement learning to perform bubble-sort-style adjacent swaps. Models achieve high accuracy even with very small embedding dimensions, but larger dimensions yield more faithful, consistent, and robust internal representations. In particular, higher embedding dimensions strengthen the formation of structured internal representation and lead to better interpretability. After hundreds of experiments, we observe two consistent mechanisms: (1) the last row of the attention weight matrix monotonically encodes the global ordering of tokens; and (2) the selected transposition aligns with the largest adjacent difference of these encoded values. Our results provide quantitative evidence that transformers build structured internal world models and that model size improves representation quality in addition to end performance. We release our metrics and analyses, which can be used to probe similar algorithmic tasks.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Estimation by Flexible Evidential Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial for deploying machine learning models in high-stakes applications, where overconfident predictions can lead to serious consequences. An effective UQ method must balance computational efficiency with the ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. Evidential deep learning (EDL) achieves efficiency by modeling uncertainty through the prediction of a Dirichlet distribution over class probabilities. However, the restrictive assumption of Dirichlet-distributed class probabilities limits EDL's robustness, particularly in complex or unforeseen situations. To address this, we propose \textit{flexible evidential deep learning} ($\mathcal{F}$-EDL), which extends EDL by predicting a flexible Dirichlet distribution -- a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution -- over class probabilities. This approach provides a more expressive and adaptive representation of uncertainty, significantly enhancing UQ generalization and reliability under challenging scenarios. We theoretically establish several advantages of $\mathcal{F}$-EDL and empirically demonstrate its state-of-the-art UQ performance across diverse evaluation settings, including classical, long-tailed, and noisy in-distribution scenarios.</description>

      <title>Scalable, Explainable and Provably Robust Anomaly Detection with One-Step Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Time-Conditioned Contraction Matching (TCCM), a novel method for semi-supervised anomaly detection in tabular data. TCCM is inspired by flow matching, a recent generative modeling framework that learns velocity fields between probability distributions and has shown strong performance compared to diffusion models and generative adversarial networks. Instead of directly applying flow matching as originally formulated, TCCM builds on its core idea -- learning velocity fields between distributions -- but simplifies the framework by predicting a time-conditioned contraction vector toward a fixed target (the origin) at each sampled time step. This design offers three key advantages: (1) a lightweight and scalable training objective that removes the need for solving ordinary differential equations during training and inference; (2) an efficient scoring strategy called one time-step deviation, which quantifies deviation from expected contraction behavior in a single forward pass, addressing the inference bottleneck of existing continuous-time models such as DTE (a diffusion-based model with leading anomaly detection accuracy but heavy inference cost); and (3) explainability and provable robustness, as the learned velocity field operates directly in input space, making the anomaly score inherently feature-wise attributable; moreover, the score function is Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the input, providing theoretical guarantees under small perturbations. Extensive experiments on the ADBench benchmark show that TCCM strikes a favorable balance between detection accuracy and inference cost, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- especially on high-dimensional and large-scale datasets.

      <title>Why Policy Gradient Algorithms Work for Undiscounted Total-Reward MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical policy gradient method is the theoretical and conceptual foundation of modern policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Most rigorous analyses of such methods, particularly those establishing convergence guarantees, assume a discount factor $\gamma &lt; 1$. In contrast, however, a recent line of work on policy-based RL for large language models uses the undiscounted total-reward setting with $\gamma = 1$, rendering much of the existing theory inapplicable. In this paper, we provide analyses of the policy gradient method for undiscounted expected total-reward infinite-horizon MDPs based on two key insights: (i) the classification of the MDP states into recurrent and transient states is invariant over the set of policies that assign strictly positive probability to every action (as is typical in deep RL models employing a softmax output layer) and (ii) the classical state visitation measure (which may be ill-defined when $\gamma = 1$) can be replaced with a new object that we call the transient visitation measure.</description>

      <title>Computable universal online learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding when learning is possible is a fundamental task in the theory of machine learning. However, many characterizations known from the literature deal with abstract learning as a mathematical object and ignore the crucial question: when can learning be implemented as a computer program? We address this question for universal online learning, a generalist theoretical model of online binary classification, recently characterized by Bousquet et al. (STOC'21). In this model, there is no hypothesis fixed in advance; instead, Adversary -- playing the role of Nature -- can change their mind as long as local consistency with the given class of hypotheses is maintained. We require Learner to achieve a finite number of mistakes while using a strategy that can be implemented as a computer program. We show that universal online learning does not imply computable universal online learning, even if the class of hypotheses is relatively easy from a computability-theoretic perspective. We then study the agnostic variant of computable universal online learning and provide an exact characterization of classes that are learnable in this sense. We also consider a variant of proper universal online learning and show exactly when it is possible. Together, our results give a more realistic perspective on the existing theory of online binary classification and the related problem of inductive inference.</description>

      <title>Ensembling Pruned Attention Heads For Uncertainty-Aware Efficient Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying deep neural networks in safety-critical settings. Although methods like Deep Ensembles achieve strong UQ performance, their high computational and memory costs hinder scalability to large models. We introduce Hydra Ensembles, an efficient transformer-based ensemble that prunes attention heads to create diverse members and merges them via a new multi-head attention with grouped fully-connected layers. This yields a compact model with inference speed close to a single network, matching or surpassing Deep Ensembles in UQ performance without retraining from scratch. We also provide an in-depth analysis of pruning, showing that naive approaches can harm calibration, whereas Hydra Ensembles preserves robust uncertainty. Experiments on image and text classification tasks, with various architectures, show consistent gains over Deep Ensembles. Remarkably, in zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k, our approach surpasses state of the art methods, even without requiring additional training.</description>

      <title>Learning to Flow from Generative Pretext Tasks for Neural Architecture Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of a deep learning model on a specific task and dataset depends heavily on its neural architecture, motivating considerable efforts to rapidly and accurately identify architectures suited to the target task and dataset. To achieve this, researchers use machine learning models-typically neural architecture encoders-to predict the performance of a neural architecture. Many state-of-the-art encoders aim to capture information flow within a neural architecture, which reflects how information moves through the forward pass and backpropagation, via a specialized model structure. However, due to their complicated structures, these flow-based encoders are significantly slower to process neural architectures compared to simpler encoders, presenting a notable practical challenge. To address this, we propose FGP, a novel pre-training method for neural architecture encoding that trains an encoder to capture the information flow without requiring specialized model structures. FGP trains an encoder to reconstruct a flow surrogate, our proposed representation of the neural architecture's information flow. Our experiments show that FGP boosts encoder performance by up to 106% in Precision-1%, compared to the same encoder trained solely with supervised learning.</description>

      <title>Towards Unsupervised Open-Set Graph Domain Adaptation via Dual Reprogramming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation has become a promising paradigm for transferring knowledge from a fully labeled source graph to an unlabeled target graph. Existing graph domain adaptation models primarily focus on the closed-set setting, where the source and target domains share the same label spaces. However, this assumption might not be practical in the real-world scenarios, as the target domain might include classes that are not present in the source domain. In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised open-set graph domain adaptation, where the goal is to not only correctly classify target nodes into the known classes, but also recognize previously unseen node types into the unknown class. Towards this end, we propose a novel framework called GraphRTA, which conducts reprogramming on both the graph and model sides. Specifically, we reprogram the graph by modifying target graph structure and node features, which facilitates better separation of known and unknown classes. Meanwhile, we also perform model reprogramming by pruning domain-specific parameters to reduce bias towards the source graph while preserving parameters that capture transferable patterns across graphs. Additionally, we extend the classifier with an extra dimension for the unknown class, thus eliminating the need of manually specified threshold in open-set recognition. Comprehensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can achieve satisfied performance compared with recent state-of-the-art baselines.

      <title>Training Diverse Graph Experts for Ensembles: A Systematic Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential tools for learning on relational data, yet the performance of a single GNN is often limited by the heterogeneity present in real-world graphs. Recent advances in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) frameworks demonstrate that assembling multiple, explicitly diverse GNNs with distinct generalization patterns can significantly improve performance. In this work, we present the first systematic empirical study of expert-level diversification techniques for GNN ensembles. Evaluating 20 diversification strategies -- including random re-initialization, hyperparameter tuning, architectural variation, directionality modeling, and training data partitioning -- across 14 node classification benchmarks, we construct and analyze over 200 ensemble variants. Our comprehensive evaluation examines each technique in terms of expert diversity, complementarity, and ensemble performance. We also uncovers mechanistic insights into training maximally diverse experts. These findings provide actionable guidance for expert training and the design of effective MoE frameworks on graph data.

      <title>Approximation Rates of Shallow Neural Networks: Barron Spaces, Activation Functions and Optimality Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the approximation properties of shallow neural networks with activation functions that are powers of exponential functions. It focuses on the dependence of the approximation rate on the dimension and the smoothness of the function being approximated within the Barron function space. We examine the approximation rates of ReLU$^{k}$ activation functions, proving that the optimal rate cannot be achieved under $\ell^{1}$-bounded coefficients or insufficient smoothness conditions.
  We also establish optimal approximation rates in various norms for functions in Barron spaces and Sobolev spaces, confirming the curse of dimensionality. Our results clarify the limits of shallow neural networks' approximation capabilities and offer insights into the selection of activation functions and network structures.</description>

      <title>Learning from N-Tuple Data with M Positive Instances: Unbiased Risk Estimation and Theoretical Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly supervised learning often operates with coarse aggregate signals rather than instance labels. We study a setting where each training example is an $n$-tuple containing exactly m positives, while only the count m per tuple is observed. This NTMP (N-tuple with M positives) supervision arises in, e.g., image classification with region proposals and multi-instance measurements. We show that tuple counts admit a trainable unbiased risk estimator (URE) by linking the tuple-generation process to latent instance marginals. Starting from fixed (n,m), we derive a closed-form URE and extend it to variable tuple sizes, variable counts, and their combination. Identification holds whenever the effective mixing rate is separated from the class prior. We establish generalization bounds via Rademacher complexity and prove statistical consistency with standard rates under mild regularity assumptions. To improve finite-sample stability, we introduce simple ReLU corrections to the URE that preserve asymptotic correctness. Across benchmarks converted to NTMP tasks, the approach consistently outperforms representative weak-supervision baselines and yields favorable precision-recall and F1 trade-offs. It remains robust under class-prior imbalance and across diverse tuple configurations, demonstrating that count-only supervision can be exploited effectively through a theoretically grounded and practically stable objective.</description>

      <title>Provable Generalization Bounds for Deep Neural Networks with Adaptive Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve remarkable performance but often suffer from overfitting due to their high capacity. We introduce Momentum-Adaptive Gradient Dropout (MAGDrop), a novel regularization method that dynamically adjusts dropout rates on activations based on current gradients and accumulated momentum, enhancing stability in non-convex optimization landscapes. To theoretically justify MAGDrop's effectiveness, we derive a tightened PAC-Bayes generalization bound that accounts for its adaptive nature, achieving up to 20% sharper bounds compared to standard approaches by leveraging momentum-driven perturbation control. Empirically, the activation-based MAGDrop outperforms baseline regularization techniques, including standard dropout and adaptive gradient regularization, by 1-2% in test accuracy on MNIST (99.52%) and CIFAR-10 (90.63%), with generalization gaps of 0.48% and 7.14%, respectively. Our work bridges theoretical insights and practical advancements, offering a robust framework for enhancing DNN generalization suitable for high-stakes applications.</description>

      <title>Learning Boltzmann Generators via Constrained Mass Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient sampling from high-dimensional and multimodal unnormalized probability distributions is a central challenge in many areas of science and machine learning. We focus on Boltzmann generators (BGs) that aim to sample the Boltzmann distribution of physical systems, such as molecules, at a given temperature. Classical variational approaches that minimize the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence are prone to mode collapse, while annealing-based methods, commonly using geometric schedules, can suffer from mass teleportation and rely heavily on schedule tuning. We introduce Constrained Mass Transport (CMT), a variational framework that generates intermediate distributions under constraints on both the KL divergence and the entropy decay between successive steps. These constraints enhance distributional overlap, mitigate mass teleportation, and counteract premature convergence. Across standard BG benchmarks and the here introduced ELIL tetrapeptide, the largest system studied to date without access to samples from molecular dynamics, CMT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art variational methods, achieving more than 2.5x higher effective sample size while avoiding mode collapse.</description>

      <title>Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs) are ubiquitous data structures in the real world. Recently, to enhance representation learning on HTGs, numerous attention-based neural networks have been proposed. Despite these successes, existing methods rely on a decoupled temporal and spatial learning paradigm, which weakens interactions of spatio-temporal information and leads to a high model complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel learning paradigm for HTGs called Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Temporal Graph N}eural Network (SE-HTGNN). Specifically, we innovatively integrate temporal modeling into spatial learning via a novel dynamic attention mechanism, which retains attention information from historical graph snapshots to guide subsequent attention computation, thereby improving the overall discriminative representations learning of HTGs. Additionally, to comprehensively and adaptively understand HTGs, we leverage large language models to prompt SE-HTGNN, enabling the model to capture the implicit properties of node types as prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SE-HTGNN achieves up to 10x speed-up over the state-of-the-art and latest baseline while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Fairness-aware Graph Neural Networks in Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data but often produce biased predictions with respect to sensitive attributes. Fairness-aware GNNs have been actively studied for mitigating biased predictions. However, no prior studies have evaluated fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs, which are one of the most important graphs in many applications, such as recommender systems. Therefore, we introduce a benchmarking study on knowledge graphs. We generate new graphs from three knowledge graphs, YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata, that are significantly larger than the existing graph datasets used in fairness studies. We benchmark inprocessing and preprocessing methods in different GNN backbones and early stopping conditions. We find several key insights: (i) knowledge graphs show different trends from existing datasets; clearer trade-offs between prediction accuracy and fairness metrics than other graphs in fairness-aware GNNs, (ii) the performance is largely affected by not only fairness-aware GNN methods but also GNN backbones and early stopping conditions, and (iii) preprocessing methods often improve fairness metrics, while inprocessing methods improve prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Safe But Not Sorry: Reducing Over-Conservatism in Safety Critics via Uncertainty-Aware Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the safe exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) agents is critical for deployment in real-world systems. Yet existing approaches struggle to strike the right balance: methods that tightly enforce safety often cripple task performance, while those that prioritize reward leave safety constraints frequently violated, producing diffuse cost landscapes that flatten gradients and stall policy improvement. We introduce the Uncertain Safety Critic (USC), a novel approach that integrates uncertainty-aware modulation and refinement into critic training. By concentrating conservatism in uncertain and costly regions while preserving sharp gradients in safe areas, USC enables policies to achieve effective reward-safety trade-offs. Extensive experiments show that USC reduces safety violations by approximately 40% while maintaining competitive or higher rewards, and reduces the error between predicted and true cost gradients by approximately 83%, breaking the prevailing trade-off between safety and performance and paving the way for scalable safe RL.</description>

      <title>Learning to Navigate Under Imperfect Perception: Conformalised Segmentation for Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable navigation in safety-critical environments requires both accurate hazard perception and principled uncertainty handling to strengthen downstream safety handling. Despite the effectiveness of existing approaches, they assume perfect hazard detection capabilities, while uncertainty-aware perception approaches lack finite-sample guarantees. We present COPPOL, a conformal-driven perception-to-policy learning approach that integrates distribution-free, finite-sample safety guarantees into semantic segmentation, yielding calibrated hazard maps with rigorous bounds for missed detections. These maps induce risk-aware cost fields for downstream RL planning. Across two satellite-derived benchmarks, COPPOL increases hazard coverage (up to 6x) compared to comparative baselines, achieving near-complete detection of unsafe regions while reducing hazardous violations during navigation (up to approx 50%). More importantly, our approach remains robust to distributional shift, preserving both safety and efficiency.</description>

Abstract: This study presents the multilingual e-commerce search system developed by the DILAB team, which achieved 5th place on the final leaderboard with a competitive overall score of 0.8819, demonstrating stable and high-performing results across evaluation metrics. To address challenges in multilingual query-item understanding, we designed a multi-stage pipeline integrating data refinement, lightweight preprocessing, and adaptive modeling. The data refinement stage enhanced dataset consistency and category coverage, while language tagging and noise filtering improved input quality. In the modeling phase, multiple architectures and fine-tuning strategies were explored, and hyperparameters optimized using curated validation sets to balance performance across query-category (QC) and query-item (QI) tasks. The proposed framework exhibited robustness and adaptability across languages and domains, highlighting the effectiveness of systematic data curation and iterative evaluation for multilingual search systems.

      <title>Partial VOROS: A Cost-aware Performance Metric for Binary Classifiers with Precision and Capacity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ROC curve is widely used to assess binary classification performance. Yet for some applications such as alert systems for hospitalized patient monitoring, conventional ROC analysis cannot capture crucial factors that impact deployment, such as enforcing a minimum precision constraint to avoid false alarm fatigue or imposing an upper bound on the number of predicted positives to represent the capacity of hospital staff. The usual area under the curve metric also does not reflect asymmetric costs for false positives and false negatives. In this paper we address all three of these issues. First, we show how the subset of classifiers that meet given precision and capacity constraints can be represented as a feasible region in ROC space. We establish the geometry of this feasible region. We then define the partial area of lesser classifiers, a performance metric that is monotonic with cost and only accounts for the feasible portion of ROC space. Averaging this area over a desired range of cost parameters results in the partial volume over the ROC surface, or partial VOROS. In experiments predicting mortality risk using vital sign history on the MIMIC-IV dataset, we show this cost-aware metric is better than alternatives for ranking classifiers in hospital alert applications.</description>

      <title>Pay Attention to the Triggers: Constructing Backdoors That Survive Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs are often used by downstream users as teacher models for knowledge distillation, compressing their capabilities into memory-efficient models. However, as these teacher models may stem from untrusted parties, distillation can raise unexpected security risks. In this paper, we investigate the security implications of knowledge distillation from backdoored teacher models. First, we show that prior backdoors mostly do not transfer onto student models. Our key insight is that this is because existing LLM backdooring methods choose trigger tokens that rarely occur in usual contexts. We argue that this underestimates the security risks of knowledge distillation and introduce a new backdooring technique, T-MTB, that enables the construction and study of transferable backdoors. T-MTB carefully constructs a composite backdoor trigger, made up of several specific tokens that often occur individually in anticipated distillation datasets. As such, the poisoned teacher remains stealthy, while during distillation the individual presence of these tokens provides enough signal for the backdoor to transfer onto the student. Using T-MTB, we demonstrate and extensively study the security risks of transferable backdoors across two attack scenarios, jailbreaking and content modulation, and across four model families of LLMs.</description>

      <title>RAISE: A Unified Framework for Responsible AI Scoring and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI systems enter high-stakes domains, evaluation must extend beyond predictive accuracy to include explainability, fairness, robustness, and sustainability. We introduce RAISE (Responsible AI Scoring and Evaluation), a unified framework that quantifies model performance across these four dimensions and aggregates them into a single, holistic Responsibility Score. We evaluated three deep learning models: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a Tabular ResNet, and a Feature Tokenizer Transformer, on structured datasets from finance, healthcare, and socioeconomics. Our findings reveal critical trade-offs: the MLP demonstrated strong sustainability and robustness, the Transformer excelled in explainability and fairness at a very high environmental cost, and the Tabular ResNet offered a balanced profile. These results underscore that no single model dominates across all responsibility criteria, highlighting the necessity of multi-dimensional evaluation for responsible model selection. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/raise-framework/raise.</description>

      <title>HeFS: Helper-Enhanced Feature Selection via Pareto-Optimized Genetic Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature selection is a combinatorial optimization problem that is NP-hard. Conventional approaches often employ heuristic or greedy strategies, which are prone to premature convergence and may fail to capture subtle yet informative features. This limitation becomes especially critical in high-dimensional datasets, where complex and interdependent feature relationships prevail. We introduce the HeFS (Helper-Enhanced Feature Selection) framework to refine feature subsets produced by existing algorithms. HeFS systematically searches the residual feature space to identify a Helper Set - features that complement the original subset and improve classification performance. The approach employs a biased initialization scheme and a ratio-guided mutation mechanism within a genetic algorithm, coupled with Pareto-based multi-objective optimization to jointly maximize predictive accuracy and feature complementarity. Experiments on 18 benchmark datasets demonstrate that HeFS consistently identifies overlooked yet informative features and achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, including in challenging domains such as gastric cancer classification, drug toxicity prediction, and computer science applications. The code and datasets are available at https://healthinformaticslab.org/supp/.</description>

      <title>Robustness Verification of Graph Neural Networks Via Lightweight Satisfiability Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the predominant architecture for learning over graphs. As with any machine learning model, and important issue is the detection of adversarial attacks, where an adversary can change the output with a small perturbation of the input. Techniques for solving the adversarial robustness problem - determining whether such an attack exists - were originally developed for image classification, but there are variants for many other machine learning architectures. In the case of graph learning, the attack model usually considers changes to the graph structure in addition to or instead of the numerical features of the input, and the state of the art techniques in the area proceed via reduction to constraint solving, working on top of powerful solvers, e.g. for mixed integer programming. We show that it is possible to improve on the state of the art in structural robustness by replacing the use of powerful solvers by calls to efficient partial solvers, which run in polynomial time but may be incomplete. We evaluate our tool RobLight on a diverse set of GNN variants and datasets.</description>

      <title>Unrolled-SINDy: A Stable Explicit Method for Non linear PDE Discovery from Sparsely Sampled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying from observation data the governing differential equations of a physical dynamics is a key challenge in machine learning. Although approaches based on SINDy have shown great promise in this area, they still fail to address a whole class of real world problems where the data is sparsely sampled in time. In this article, we introduce Unrolled-SINDy, a simple methodology that leverages an unrolling scheme to improve the stability of explicit methods for PDE discovery. By decorrelating the numerical time step size from the sampling rate of the available data, our approach enables the recovery of equation parameters that would not be the minimizers of the original SINDy optimization problem due to large local truncation errors. Our method can be exploited either through an iterative closed-form approach or by a gradient descent scheme. Experiments show the versatility of our method. On both traditional SINDy and state-of-the-art noise-robust iNeuralSINDy, with different numerical schemes (Euler, RK4), our proposed unrolling scheme allows to tackle problems not accessible to non-unrolled methods.</description>

      <title>A Rectification-Based Approach for Distilling Boosted Trees into Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach for distilling boosted trees into decision trees, in the objective of generating an ML model offering an acceptable compromise in terms of predictive performance and interpretability. We explain how the correction approach called rectification can be used to implement such a distillation process. We show empirically that this approach provides interesting results, in comparison with an approach to distillation achieved by retraining the model.</description>

      <title>Hardness of Learning Regular Languages in the Next Symbol Prediction Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the learnability of languages in the Next Symbol Prediction (NSP) setting, where a learner receives only positive examples from a language together with, for every prefix, (i) whether the prefix itself is in the language and (ii) which next symbols can lead to an accepting string. This setting has been used in prior works to empirically analyze neural sequence models, and additionally, we observe that efficient algorithms for the NSP setting can be used to learn the (truncated) support of language models. We formalize the setting so as to make it amenable to PAC-learning analysis. While the setting provides a much richer set of labels than the conventional classification setting, we show that learning concept classes such as DFAs and Boolean formulas remains computationally hard. The proof is via a construction that makes almost all additional labels uninformative, yielding a reduction from the conventional learning problem to learning with NSP labels. Under cryptographic assumptions, the reduction implies that the problem of learning DFAs is computationally hard in the NSP setting.</description>

      <title>Optimality and NP-Hardness of Transformers in Learning Markovian Dynamical Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer architectures can solve unseen tasks based on input-output pairs in a given prompt due to in-context learning (ICL). Existing theoretical studies on ICL have mainly focused on linear regression tasks, often with i.i.d. inputs. To understand how transformers express ICL when modeling dynamics-driven functions, we investigate Markovian function learning through a structured ICL setup, where we characterize the loss landscape to reveal underlying optimization behaviors. Specifically, we (1) provide the closed-form expression of the global minimizer (in an enlarged parameter space) for a single-layer linear self-attention (LSA) model; (2) prove that recovering transformer parameters that realize the optimal solution is NP-hard in general, revealing a fundamental limitation of one-layer LSA in representing structured dynamical functions; and (3) supply a novel interpretation of a multilayer LSA as performing preconditioned gradient descent to optimize multiple objectives beyond the square loss. These theoretical results are numerically validated using simplified transformers.</description>

      <title>Informed Learning for Estimating Drought Stress at Fine-Scale Resolution Enables Accurate Yield Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water is essential for agricultural productivity. Assessing water shortages and reduced yield potential is a critical factor in decision-making for ensuring agricultural productivity and food security. Crop simulation models, which align with physical processes, offer intrinsic explainability but often perform poorly. Conversely, machine learning models for crop yield modeling are powerful and scalable, yet they commonly operate as black boxes and lack adherence to the physical principles of crop growth. This study bridges this gap by coupling the advantages of both worlds. We postulate that the crop yield is inherently defined by the water availability. Therefore, we formulate crop yield as a function of temporal water scarcity and predict both the crop drought stress and the sensitivity to water scarcity at fine-scale resolution. Sequentially modeling the crop yield response to water enables accurate yield prediction. To enforce physical consistency, a novel physics-informed loss function is proposed. We leverage multispectral satellite imagery, meteorological data, and fine-scale yield data. Further, to account for the uncertainty within the model, we build upon a deep ensemble approach. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art models like LSTM and Transformers in crop yield prediction with a coefficient of determination ($R^2$-score) of up to 0.82 while offering high explainability. This method offers decision support for industry, policymakers, and farmers in building a more resilient agriculture in times of changing climate conditions.</description>

      <title>Learning Time-Varying Turn-Taking Behavior in Group Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a flexible probabilistic model for predicting turn-taking patterns in group conversations based solely on individual characteristics and past speaking behavior. Many models of conversation dynamics cannot yield insights that generalize beyond a single group. Moreover, past works often aim to characterize speaking behavior through a universal formulation that may not be suitable for all groups. We thus develop a generalization of prior conversation models that predicts speaking turns among individuals in any group based on their individual characteristics, that is, personality traits, and prior speaking behavior. Importantly, our approach provides the novel ability to learn how speaking inclination varies based on when individuals last spoke. We apply our model to synthetic and real-world conversation data to verify the proposed approach and characterize real group interactions. Our results demonstrate that previous behavioral models may not always be realistic, motivating our data-driven yet theoretically grounded approach.</description>

      <title>Prototyping an End-to-End Multi-Modal Tiny-CNN for Cardiovascular Sensor Patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vast majority of cardiovascular diseases may be preventable if early signs and risk factors are detected. Cardiovascular monitoring with body-worn sensor devices like sensor patches allows for the detection of such signs while preserving the freedom and comfort of patients. However, the analysis of the sensor data must be robust, reliable, efficient, and highly accurate. Deep learning methods can automate data interpretation, reducing the workload of clinicians. In this work, we analyze the feasibility of applying deep learning models to the classification of synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings on resource-constrained medical edge devices. We propose a convolutional neural network with early fusion of data to solve a binary classification problem. We train and validate our model on the synchronized ECG and PCG recordings from the Physionet Challenge 2016 dataset. Our approach reduces memory footprint and compute cost by three orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art while maintaining competitive accuracy. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed model on medical edge devices by analyzing energy consumption on a microcontroller and an experimental sensor device setup, confirming that on-device inference can be more energy-efficient than continuous data streaming.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Language Model Inference Serving Unveiled: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reasoning large language model (RLLM) has been proven competitive in solving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics, coding, compared to general LLM. However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains unexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in real-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on comparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal that there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1) significant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive running time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether existing inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main takeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can improve service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while prefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving performance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world workload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings. Empirical results of real world workload evaluation across different dataset are aligned with our main findings regarding RLLM serving. We hope our work can provide the research community and industry with insights to advance RLLM inference serving.</description>

      <title>Learning Task-Agnostic Representations through Multi-Teacher Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Casting complex inputs into tractable representations is a critical step across various fields. Diverse embedding models emerge from differences in architectures, loss functions, input modalities and datasets, each capturing unique aspects of the input. Multi-teacher distillation leverages this diversity to enrich representations but often remains tailored to specific tasks. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic framework based on a ``majority vote" objective function. We demonstrate that this function is bounded by the mutual information between student and teachers' embeddings, leading to a task-agnostic distillation loss that eliminates dependence on task-specific labels or prior knowledge. Our evaluations across text, vision models, and molecular modeling show that our method effectively leverages teacher diversity, resulting in representations enabling better performance for a wide range of downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, or regression. Additionally, we train and release state-of-the-art embedding models, enhancing downstream performance in various modalities.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Imperfect Transition Predictions: A Bellman-Jensen Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) assumes the agents make decisions based on Markov decision processes (MDPs) with one-step transition models. In many real-world applications, such as energy management and stock investment, agents can access multi-step predictions of future states, which provide additional advantages for decision making. However, multi-step predictions are inherently high-dimensional: naively embedding these predictions into an MDP leads to an exponential blow-up in state space and the curse of dimensionality. Moreover, existing RL theory provides few tools to analyze prediction-augmented MDPs, as it typically works on one-step transition kernels and cannot accommodate multi-step predictions with errors or partial action-coverage. We address these challenges with three key innovations: First, we propose the \emph{Bayesian value function} to characterize the optimal prediction-aware policy tractably. Second, we develop a novel \emph{Bellman-Jensen Gap} analysis on the Bayesian value function, which enables characterizing the value of imperfect predictions. Third, we introduce BOLA (Bayesian Offline Learning with Online Adaptation), a two-stage model-based RL algorithm that separates offline Bayesian value learning from lightweight online adaptation to real-time predictions. We prove that BOLA remains sample-efficient even under imperfect predictions. We validate our theory and algorithm on synthetic MDPs and a real-world wind energy storage control problem.</description>

      <title>OmniCast: A Masked Latent Diffusion Model for Weather Forecasting Across Time Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate weather forecasting across time scales is critical for anticipating and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recent data-driven methods based on deep learning have achieved significant success in the medium range, but struggle at longer subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) horizons due to error accumulation in their autoregressive approach. In this work, we propose OmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather forecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model that encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent space, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of future latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we mask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their distribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion head. During inference, the transformer generates the full sequence of future tokens by iteratively unmasking random subsets of tokens. This joint sampling across space and time mitigates compounding errors from autoregressive approaches. The low-dimensional latent space enables modeling long sequences of future latent states, allowing the transformer to learn weather dynamics beyond initial conditions. OmniCast performs competitively with leading probabilistic methods at the medium-range timescale while being 10x to 20x faster, and achieves state-of-the-art performance at the subseasonal-to-seasonal scale across accuracy, physics-based, and probabilistic metrics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that OmniCast can generate stable rollouts up to 100 years ahead. Code and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/tung-nd/omnicast.</description>

      <title>Preference-based Reinforcement Learning beyond Pairwise Comparisons: Benefits of Multiple Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study online preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) with the goal of improving sample efficiency. While a growing body of theoretical work has emerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning large language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise comparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024, Thekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and ranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even deteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information available. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for ranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that selects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the offered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}} \right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature dimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result shows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably, the bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm, which was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we establish a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega \left( \frac{d}{K \sqrt{T}} \right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that explicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.</description>

      <title>Improving the Generation and Evaluation of Synthetic Data for Downstream Medical Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal inference is essential for developing and evaluating medical interventions, yet real-world medical datasets are often difficult to access due to regulatory barriers. This makes synthetic data a potentially valuable asset that enables these medical analyses, along with the development of new inference methods themselves. Generative models can produce synthetic data that closely approximate real data distributions, yet existing methods do not consider the unique challenges that downstream causal inference tasks, and specifically those focused on treatments, pose. We establish a set of desiderata that synthetic data containing treatments should satisfy to maximise downstream utility: preservation of (i) the covariate distribution, (ii) the treatment assignment mechanism, and (iii) the outcome generation mechanism. Based on these desiderata, we propose a set of evaluation metrics to assess such synthetic data. Finally, we present STEAM: a novel method for generating Synthetic data for Treatment Effect Analysis in Medicine that mimics the data-generating process of data containing treatments and optimises for our desiderata. We empirically demonstrate that STEAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across our metrics as compared to existing generative models, particularly as the complexity of the true data-generating process increases.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fractional Gradient Descent with Learned Optimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional Gradient Descent (FGD) offers a novel and promising way to accelerate optimization by incorporating fractional calculus into machine learning. Although FGD has shown encouraging initial results across various optimization tasks, it faces significant challenges with convergence behavior and hyperparameter selection. Moreover, the impact of its hyperparameters is not fully understood, and scheduling them is particularly difficult in non-convex settings such as neural network training. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach called Learning to Optimize Caputo Fractional Gradient Descent (L2O-CFGD), which meta-learns how to dynamically tune the hyperparameters of Caputo FGD (CFGD). Our method's meta-learned schedule outperforms CFGD with static hyperparameters found through an extensive search and, in some tasks, achieves performance comparable to a fully black-box meta-learned optimizer. L2O-CFGD can thus serve as a powerful tool for researchers to identify high-performing hyperparameters and gain insights on how to leverage the history-dependence of the fractional differential in optimization.</description>

      <title>CAGE: Curvature-Aware Gradient Estimation For Accurate Quantization-Aware Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant work on low-bit quantization-aware training (QAT), there is still a large accuracy gap between such techniques and native training. To address this, we introduce CAGE (Curvature-Aware Gradient Estimation), a new QAT method that augments the straight-through estimator (STE) gradient with a curvature-aware correction designed to counteract the loss increase induced by quantization. CAGE is derived from a multi-objective view of QAT that balances loss minimization with adherence to quantization constraints, yielding a principled correction term that depends on local curvature information. On the theoretical side, we introduce the notion of Pareto-optimal solutions for quantized optimization, and establish that CAGE yields strong convergence guarantees in the smooth non-convex setting. In terms of implementation, our approach is optimizer-agnostic, but we provide a highly-efficient implementation that leverages Adam statistics. When pre-training Llama-style models of up to 800M-parameters, CAGE recovers over 10% of the quantization-induced loss increase in the W4A4 regime over outlier-mitigation methods. These results indicate that curvature-aware gradient corrections can bridge the remaining performance gap beyond current outlier-handling methods.</description>

      <title>Stick-Breaking Embedded Topic Model with Continuous Optimal Transport for Online Analysis of Document Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online topic models are unsupervised algorithms to identify latent topics in data streams that continuously evolve over time. Although these methods naturally align with real-world scenarios, they have received considerably less attention from the community compared to their offline counterparts, due to specific additional challenges. To tackle these issues, we present SB-SETM, an innovative model extending the Embedded Topic Model (ETM) to process data streams by merging models formed on successive partial document batches. To this end, SB-SETM (i) leverages a truncated stick-breaking construction for the topic-per-document distribution, enabling the model to automatically infer from the data the appropriate number of active topics at each timestep; and (ii) introduces a merging strategy for topic embeddings based on a continuous formulation of optimal transport adapted to the high dimensionality of the latent topic space. Numerical experiments show SB-SETM outperforming baselines on simulated scenarios. We extensively test it on a real-world corpus of news articles covering the Russian-Ukrainian war throughout 2022-2023.</description>

      <title>On Biologically Plausible Learning in Continuous Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological learning unfolds continuously in time, yet most algorithmic models rely on discrete updates and separate inference and learning phases. We study a continuous-time neural model that unifies several biologically plausible learning algorithms and removes the need for phase separation. Rules including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), feedback alignment (FA), direct feedback alignment (DFA), and Kolen-Pollack (KP) emerge naturally as limiting cases of the dynamics. Simulations show that these continuous-time networks stably learn at biological timescales, even under temporal mismatches and integration noise. Through analysis and simulation, we show that learning depends on temporal overlap: a synapse updates correctly only when its input and the corresponding error signal coincide in time. When inputs are held constant, learning strength declines linearly as the delay between input and error approaches the stimulus duration, explaining observed robustness and failure across network depths. Critically, robust learning requires the synaptic plasticity timescale to exceed the stimulus duration by one to two orders of magnitude. For typical cortical stimuli (tens of milliseconds), this places the functional plasticity window in the few-second range, a testable prediction that identifies seconds-scale eligibility traces as necessary for error-driven learning in biological circuits.</description>

      <title>When LRP Diverges from Leave-One-Out in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leave-One-Out (LOO) provides an intuitive measure of feature importance but is computationally prohibitive. While Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a potentially efficient alternative, its axiomatic soundness in modern Transformers remains largely under-examined. In this work, we first show that the bilinear propagation rules used in recent advances of AttnLRP violate the implementation invariance axiom. We prove this analytically and confirm it empirically in linear attention layers. Second, we also revisit CP-LRP as a diagnostic baseline and find that bypassing relevance propagation through the softmax layer -- backpropagating relevance only through the value matrices -- significantly improves alignment with LOO, particularly in middle-to-late Transformer layers. Overall, our results suggest that (i) bilinear factorization sensitivity and (ii) softmax propagation error potentially jointly undermine LRP's ability to approximate LOO in Transformers.</description>

      <title>A Unified Perspective on Optimization in Machine Learning and Neuroscience: From Gradient Descent to Neural Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iterative optimization is central to modern artificial intelligence (AI) and provides a crucial framework for understanding adaptive systems. This review provides a unified perspective on this subject, bridging classic theory with neural network training and biological learning. Although gradient-based methods, powered by the efficient but biologically implausible backpropagation (BP), dominate machine learning, their computational demands can hinder scalability in high-dimensional settings. In contrast, derivative-free or zeroth-order (ZO) optimization feature computationally lighter approaches that rely only on function evaluations and randomness. While generally less sample efficient, recent breakthroughs demonstrate that modern ZO methods can effectively approximate gradients and achieve performance competitive with BP in neural network models. This ZO paradigm is also particularly relevant for biology. Its core principles of random exploration (probing) and feedback-guided adaptation (reinforcing) parallel key mechanisms of biological learning, offering a mathematically principled perspective on how the brain learns. In this review, we begin by categorizing optimization approaches based on the order of derivative information they utilize, ranging from first-, second-, and higher-order gradient-based to ZO methods. We then explore how these methods are adapted to the unique challenges of neural network training and the resulting learning dynamics. Finally, we build upon these insights to view biological learning through an optimization lens, arguing that a ZO paradigm leverages the brain's intrinsic noise as a computational resource. This framework not only illuminates our understanding of natural intelligence but also holds vast implications for neuromorphic hardware, helping us design fast and energy-efficient AI systems that exploit intrinsic hardware noise.</description>

      <title>Online SFT for LLM Reasoning: Surprising Effectiveness of Self-Tuning without Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple, self-help online supervised finetuning (OSFT) paradigm for LLM reasoning. In this paradigm, the model generates its own responses and is immediately finetuned on this self-generated data. OSFT is a highly efficient training strategy for LLM reasoning, as it is reward-free and uses just one rollout by default. Experiment results show that OSFT achieves downstream performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks comparable to strong reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) methods such as GRPO. Our ablation study further demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of OSFT. The major mechanism of OSFT lies in facilitating the model's own existing preference (latent knowledge) learned from pretraining, which leads to reasoning ability improvement. We believe that OSFT offers an efficient and promising alternative to more complex, reward-based training paradigms. Our code is available at https://github.com/ElementQi/OnlineSFT.</description>

      <title>Search Self-play: Pushing the Frontier of Agent Capability without Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become the mainstream technique for training LLM agents. However, RLVR highly depends on well-crafted task queries and corresponding ground-truth answers to provide accurate rewards, which requires massive human efforts and hinders the RL scaling processes, especially under agentic scenarios. Although a few recent works explore task synthesis methods, the difficulty of generated agentic tasks can hardly be controlled to provide effective RL training advantages. To achieve agentic RLVR with higher scalability, we explore self-play training for deep search agents, in which the learning LLM utilizes multi-turn search engine calling and acts simultaneously as both a task proposer and a problem solver. The task proposer aims to generate deep search queries with well-defined ground-truth answers and increasing task difficulty. The problem solver tries to handle the generated search queries and output the correct answer predictions. To ensure that each generated search query has accurate ground truth, we collect all the searching results from the proposer's trajectory as external knowledge, then conduct retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) to test whether the proposed query can be correctly answered with all necessary search documents provided. In this search self-play (SSP) game, the proposer and the solver co-evolve their agent capabilities through both competition and cooperation. With substantial experimental results, we find that SSP can significantly improve search agents' performance uniformly on various benchmarks without any supervision under both from-scratch and continuous RL training setups.

      <title>BO4Mob: Bayesian Optimization Benchmarks for High-Dimensional Urban Mobility Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce \textbf{BO4Mob}, a new benchmark framework for high-dimensional Bayesian Optimization (BO), driven by the challenge of origin-destination (OD) travel demand estimation in large urban road networks. Estimating OD travel demand from limited traffic sensor data is a difficult inverse optimization problem, particularly in real-world, large-scale transportation networks. This problem involves optimizing over high-dimensional continuous spaces where each objective evaluation is computationally expensive, stochastic, and non-differentiable. BO4Mob comprises five scenarios based on real-world San Jose, CA road networks, with input dimensions scaling up to 10,100. These scenarios utilize high-resolution, open-source traffic simulations that incorporate realistic nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. We demonstrate the benchmark's utility by evaluating five optimization methods: three state-of-the-art BO algorithms and two non-BO baselines. This benchmark is designed to support both the development of scalable optimization algorithms and their application for the design of data-driven urban mobility models, including high-resolution digital twins of metropolitan road networks. Code and documentation are available at https://github.com/UMN-Choi-Lab/BO4Mob.</description>

      <title>Actor-Free Continuous Control via Structurally Maximizable Q-Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Value-based algorithms are a cornerstone of off-policy reinforcement learning due to their simplicity and training stability. However, their use has traditionally been restricted to discrete action spaces, as they rely on estimating Q-values for individual state-action pairs. In continuous action spaces, evaluating the Q-value over the entire action space becomes computationally infeasible. To address this, actor-critic methods are typically employed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values, and an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output. Despite their popularity, these methods often suffer from instability during training. In this work, we propose a purely value-based framework for continuous control that revisits structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing a set of key architectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning. We evaluate the proposed actor-free Q-learning approach on a range of standard simulation tasks, demonstrating performance and sample efficiency on par with state-of-the-art baselines, without the cost of learning a separate actor. Particularly, in environments with constrained action spaces, where the value functions are typically non-smooth, our method with structural maximization outperforms traditional actor-critic methods with gradient-based maximization. We have released our code at https://github.com/USC-Lira/Q3C.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Enumeration Framework for Optimal Counterfactual Generation in Post-Acute COVID-19 Heart Failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual inference provides a mathematical framework for reasoning about hypothetical outcomes under alternative interventions, bridging causal reasoning and predictive modeling. We present a counterfactual inference framework for individualized risk estimation and intervention analysis, illustrated through a clinical application to post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) among patients with pre-existing heart failure (HF). Using longitudinal diagnosis, laboratory, and medication data from a large health-system cohort, we integrate regularized predictive modeling with counterfactual search to identify actionable pathways to PASC-related HF hospital admissions. The framework combines exact enumeration with optimization-based methods, including the Nearest Instance Counterfactual Explanations (NICE) and Multi-Objective Counterfactuals (MOC) algorithms, to efficiently explore high-dimensional intervention spaces. Applied to more than 2700 individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and prior HF, the model achieved strong discriminative performance (AUROC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.84-0.91) and generated interpretable, patient-specific counterfactuals that quantify how modifying comorbidity patterns or treatment factors could alter predicted outcomes. This work demonstrates how counterfactual reasoning can be formalized as an optimization problem over predictive functions, offering a rigorous, interpretable, and computationally efficient approach to personalized inference in complex biomedical systems.</description>

      <title>Retaining by Doing: The Role of On-Policy Data in Mitigating Forgetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting language models (LMs) to new tasks via post-training carries the risk of degrading existing capabilities -- a phenomenon classically known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for mitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns of two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge, and arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving comparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this difference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a mixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the other to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which stems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact when learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating that the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in practical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL regularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our results highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately on-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully on-policy data.</description>

      <title>In-Process Monitoring of Gear Power Honing Using Vibration Signal Analysis and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern gear manufacturing, stringent Noise, Vibration, and Harshness (NVH) requirements demand high-precision finishing operations such as power honing. Conventional quality control strategies rely on post-process inspections and Statistical Process Control (SPC), which fail to capture transient machining anomalies and cannot ensure real-time defect detection. This study proposes a novel, data-driven framework for in-process monitoring of gear power honing using vibration signal analysis and machine learning. Our proposed methodology involves continuous data acquisition via accelerometers, followed by time-frequency signal analysis. We investigate and compare the efficacy of three subspace learning methods for features extraction: (1) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction; (2) a two-stage framework combining PCA with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for enhanced class separation; and (3) Uncorrelated Multilinear Discriminant Analysis with Regularization (R-UMLDA), adapted for tensor data, which enforces feature decorrelation and includes regularization for small sample sizes. These extracted features are then fed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict four distinct gear quality categories, established through rigorous geometrical inspections and test bench results of assembled gearboxes. The models are trained and validated on an experimental dataset collected in an industrial context during gear power-honing operations, with gears classified into four different quality categories. The proposed framework achieves high classification accuracy (up to 100%) in an industrial setting. The approach offers interpretable spectral features that correlate with process dynamics, enabling practical integration into real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance systems.</description>

Abstract: The complex dynamics of the heart are reflected in its electrical activity, captured through electrocardiograms (ECGs). In this study we use nonlinear time series analysis to understand how ECG complexity varies with cardiac pathology. Using the large PTB-XL dataset, we extracted nonlinear measures from lead II ECGs, and cross-channel metrics (leads II, V2, AVL) using Spearman correlations and mutual information. Significant differences between diseased and healthy individuals were found in almost all measures between healthy and diseased classes, and between 5 diagnostic superclasses ($p&lt;.001$). Moreover, incorporating these complexity quantifiers into machine learning models substantially improved classification accuracy measured using area under the ROC curve (AUC) from 0.86 (baseline) to 0.87 (nonlinear measures) and 0.90 (including cross-time series metrics).</description>

      <title>Single-Snapshot Gridless 2D-DoA Estimation for UCAs: A Joint Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the challenging problem of gridless two-dimensional (2D) direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for a uniform circular array (UCA) from a single snapshot of data. Conventional gridless methods often fail in this scenario due to prohibitive computational costs or a lack of robustness. We propose a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by jointly estimating a manifold transformation matrix and the source azimuth-elevation pairs within a single, unified optimization problem. This problem is solved efficiently using an inexact Augmented Lagrangian Method (iALM), which completely circumvents the need for semidefinite programming. By unifying the objectives of data fidelity and transformation robustness, our approach is uniquely suited for the demanding single-snapshot case. Simulation results confirm that the proposed iALM framework provides robust and high-resolution, gridless 2D-DOA estimates, establishing its efficacy for challenging array signal processing applications.</description>

      <title>CLARAE: Clarity Preserving Reconstruction AutoEncoder for Denoising and Rhythm Classification of Intracardiac Electrograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intracavitary atrial electrograms (EGMs) provide high-resolution insights into cardiac electrophysiology but are often contaminated by noise and remain high-dimensional, limiting real-time analysis. We introduce CLARAE (CLArity-preserving Reconstruction AutoEncoder), a one-dimensional encoder--decoder designed for atrial EGMs, which achieves both high-fidelity reconstruction and a compact 64-dimensional latent representation. CLARAE is designed to preserve waveform morphology, mitigate reconstruction artifacts, and produce interpretable embeddings through three principles: downsampling with pooling, a hybrid interpolation--convolution upsampling path, and a bounded latent space.
  We evaluated CLARAE on 495,731 EGM segments (unipolar and bipolar) from 29 patients across three rhythm types (AF, SR300, SR600). Performance was benchmarked against six state-of-the-art autoencoders using reconstruction metrics, rhythm classification, and robustness across signal-to-noise ratios from -5 to 15 dB. In downstream rhythm classification, CLARAE achieved F1-scores above 0.97 for all rhythm types, and its latent space showed clear clustering by rhythm. In denoising tasks, it consistently ranked among the top performers for both unipolar and bipolar signals.
  In order to promote reproducibility and enhance accessibility, we offer an interactive web-based application. This platform enables users to explore pre-trained CLARAE models, visualize the reconstructions, and compute metrics in real time. Overall, CLARAE combines robust denoising with compact, discriminative representations, offering a practical foundation for clinical workflows such as rhythm discrimination, signal quality assessment, and real-time mapping.</description>

      <title>Covariance Matrix Construction with Preprocessing-Based Spatial Sampling for Robust Adaptive Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes an efficient, robust adaptive beamforming technique to deal with steering vector (SV) estimation mismatches and data covariance matrix reconstruction problems. In particular, the direction-of-arrival(DoA) of interfering sources is estimated with available snapshots in which the angular sectors of the interfering signals are computed adaptively. Then, we utilize the well-known general linear combination algorithm to reconstruct the interference-plus-noise covariance (IPNC) matrix using preprocessing-based spatial sampling (PPBSS). We demonstrate that the preprocessing matrix can be replaced by the sample covariance matrix (SCM) in the shrinkage method. A power spectrum sampling strategy is then devised based on a preprocessing matrix computed with the estimated angular sectors' information. Moreover, the covariance matrix for the signal is formed for the angular sector of the signal-of-interest (SOI), which allows for calculating an SV for the SOI using the power method. An analysis of the array beampattern in the proposed PPBSS technique is carried out, and a study of the computational cost of competing approaches is conducted. Simulation results show the proposed method's effectiveness compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Synthetic EEG Generation using Diffusion Models for Motor Imagery Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used, non-invasive method for capturing brain activity, and is particularly relevant for applications in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). However, collecting high-quality EEG data remains a major challenge due to sensor costs, acquisition time, and inter-subject variability. To address these limitations, this study proposes a methodology for generating synthetic EEG signals associated with motor imagery brain tasks using Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). The approach involves preprocessing real EEG data, training a diffusion model to reconstruct EEG channels from noise, and evaluating the quality of the generated signals through both signal-level and task-level metrics. For validation, we employed classifiers such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and U-Net to compare the performance of synthetic data against real data in classification tasks. The generated data achieved classification accuracies above 95%, with low mean squared error and high correlation with real signals.
  Our results demonstrate that synthetic EEG signals produced by diffusion models can effectively complement datasets, improving classification performance in EEG-based BCIs and addressing data scarcity.</description>

      <title>MAT-Agent: Adaptive Multi-Agent Training Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-label image classification demands adaptive training strategies to navigate complex, evolving visual-semantic landscapes, yet conventional methods rely on static configurations that falter in dynamic settings. We propose MAT-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework that reimagines training as a collaborative, real-time optimization process. By deploying autonomous agents to dynamically tune data augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss functions, MAT-Agent leverages non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms to balance exploration and exploitation, guided by a composite reward harmonizing accuracy, rare-class performance, and training stability. Enhanced with dual-rate exponential moving average smoothing and mixed-precision training, it ensures robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments across Pascal VOC, COCO, and VG-256 demonstrate MAT-Agent's superiority: it achieves an mAP of 97.4 (vs. 96.2 for PAT-T), OF1 of 92.3, and CF1 of 91.4 on Pascal VOC; an mAP of 92.8 (vs. 92.0 for HSQ-CvN), OF1 of 88.2, and CF1 of 87.1 on COCO; and an mAP of 60.9, OF1 of 70.8, and CF1 of 61.1 on VG-256. With accelerated convergence and robust cross-domain generalization, MAT-Agent offers a scalable, intelligent solution for optimizing complex visual models, paving the way for adaptive deep learning advancements.</description>

      <title>Neural networks for neurocomputing circuits: a computational study of tolerance to noise and activation function non-uniformity when machine learning materials properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dedicated analog neurocomputing circuits are promising for high-throughput, low power consumption applications of machine learning (ML) and for applications where implementing a digital computer is unwieldy (remote locations; small, mobile, and autonomous devices, extreme conditions, etc.). Neural networks (NN) implemented in such circuits, however, must contend with circuit noise and the non-uniform shapes of the neuron activation function (NAF) due to the dispersion of performance characteristics of circuit elements (such as transistors or diodes implementing the neurons). We present a computational study of the impact of circuit noise and NAF inhomogeneity in function of NN architecture and training regimes. We focus on one application that requires high-throughput ML: materials informatics, using as representative problem ML of formation energies vs. lowest-energy isomer of peri-condensed hydrocarbons, formation energies and band gaps of double perovskites, and zero point vibrational energies of molecules from QM9 dataset. We show that NNs generally possess low noise tolerance with the model accuracy rapidly degrading with noise level. Single-hidden layer NNs, and NNs with larger-than-optimal sizes are somewhat more noise-tolerant. Models that show less overfitting (not necessarily the lowest test set error) are more noise-tolerant. Importantly, we demonstrate that the effect of activation function inhomogeneity can be palliated by retraining the NN using practically realized shapes of NAFs.</description>

      <title>Deploying Atmospheric and Oceanic AI Models on Chinese Hardware and Framework: Migration Strategies, Performance Optimization and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing role of artificial intelligence in climate and weather research, efficient model training and inference are in high demand. Current models like FourCastNet and AI-GOMS depend heavily on GPUs, limiting hardware independence, especially for Chinese domestic hardware and frameworks. To address this issue, we present a framework for migrating large-scale atmospheric and oceanic models from PyTorch to MindSpore and optimizing for Chinese chips, and evaluating their performance against GPUs. The framework focuses on software-hardware adaptation, memory optimization, and parallelism. Furthermore, the model's performance is evaluated across multiple metrics, including training speed, inference speed, model accuracy, and energy efficiency, with comparisons against GPU-based implementations. Experimental results demonstrate that the migration and optimization process preserves the models' original accuracy while significantly reducing system dependencies and improving operational efficiency by leveraging Chinese chips as a viable alternative for scientific computing. This work provides valuable insights and practical guidance for leveraging Chinese domestic chips and frameworks in atmospheric and oceanic AI model development, offering a pathway toward greater technological independence.</description>

      <title>Provenance of AI-Generated Images: A Vector Similarity and Blockchain-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid advancement in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly realistic and contextually relevant digital content. LLMs such as ChatGPT with DALL-E integration and Stable Diffusion techniques can produce images that are often indistinguishable from those created by humans, which poses challenges for digital content authentication. Verifying the integrity and origin of digital data to ensure it remains unaltered and genuine is crucial to maintaining trust and legality in digital media. In this paper, we propose an embedding-based AI image detection framework that utilizes image embeddings and a vector similarity to distinguish AI-generated images from real (human-created) ones. Our methodology is built on the hypothesis that AI-generated images demonstrate closer embedding proximity to other AI-generated content, while human-created images cluster similarly within their domain. To validate this hypothesis, we developed a system that processes a diverse dataset of AI and human-generated images through five benchmark embedding models. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the robustness of our approach, and our results confirm that moderate to high perturbations minimally impact the embedding signatures, with perturbed images maintaining close similarity matches to their original versions. Our solution provides a generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection that balances accuracy with computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Shortcutting Pre-trained Flow Matching Diffusion Models is Almost Free Lunch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an ultra-efficient post-training method for shortcutting large-scale pre-trained flow matching diffusion models into efficient few-step samplers, enabled by novel velocity field self-distillation. While shortcutting in flow matching, originally introduced by shortcut models, offers flexible trajectory-skipping capabilities, it requires a specialized step-size embedding incompatible with existing models unless retraining from scratch$\unicode{x2013}$a process nearly as costly as pretraining itself.
  Our key contribution is thus imparting a more aggressive shortcut mechanism to standard flow matching models (e.g., Flux), leveraging a unique distillation principle that obviates the need for step-size embedding. Working on the velocity field rather than sample space and learning rapidly from self-guided distillation in an online manner, our approach trains efficiently, e.g., producing a 3-step Flux less than one A100 day. Beyond distillation, our method can be incorporated into the pretraining stage itself, yielding models that inherently learn efficient, few-step flows without compromising quality. This capability also enables, to our knowledge, the first few-shot distillation method (e.g., 10 text-image pairs) for dozen-billion-parameter diffusion models, delivering state-of-the-art performance at almost free cost.</description>

      <title>Mixed Monotonicity Reachability Analysis of Neural ODE: A Trade-Off Between Tightness and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODE) are powerful continuous-time machine learning models for depicting the behavior of complex dynamical systems, but their verification remains challenging due to limited reachability analysis tools adapted to them. We propose a novel interval-based reachability method that leverages continuous-time mixed monotonicity techniques for dynamical systems to compute an over-approximation for the neural ODE reachable sets. By exploiting the geometric structure of full initial sets and their boundaries via the homeomorphism property, our approach ensures efficient bound propagation. By embedding neural ODE dynamics into a mixed monotone system, our interval-based reachability approach, implemented in TIRA with single-step, incremental, and boundary-based approaches, provides sound and computationally efficient over-approximations compared with CORA's zonotopes and NNV2.0 star set representations, while trading tightness for efficiency. This trade-off makes our method particularly suited for high-dimensional, real-time, and safety-critical applications. Applying mixed monotonicity to neural ODE reachability analysis paves the way for lightweight formal analysis by leveraging the symmetric structure of monotone embeddings and the geometric simplicity of interval boxes, opening new avenues for scalable verification aligned with the symmetry and geometry of neural representations. This novel approach is illustrated on two numerical examples of a spiral system and a fixed-point attractor system modeled as a neural ODE.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional inversion of gravity data using implicit neural representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inversion of gravity data is an important method for investigating subsurface density variations relevant to diverse applications including mineral exploration, geothermal assessment, carbon storage, natural hydrogen, groundwater resources, and tectonic evolution. Here we present a scientific machine-learning approach for three-dimensional gravity inversion that represents subsurface density as a continuous field using an implicit neural representation (INR). The method trains a deep neural network directly through a physics-based forward-model loss, mapping spatial coordinates to a continuous density field without predefined meshes or discretisation. Positional encoding enhances the network's capacity to capture sharp contrasts and short-wavelength features that conventional coordinate-based networks tend to oversmooth due to spectral bias. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic examples including Gaussian random fields, representing realistic geological complexity, and a dipping block model to assess recovery of blocky structures. The INR framework reconstructs detailed structure and geologically plausible boundaries without explicit regularisation or depth weighting, while significantly reducing the number of inversion parameters. These results highlight the potential of implicit representations to enable scalable, flexible, and interpretable large-scale geophysical inversion. This framework could generalise to other geophysical methods and for joint/multiphysics inversion.</description>

Abstract: EEG-based person identification enables applications in security, personalized brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), and cognitive monitoring. However, existing techniques often rely on deep learning architectures at high computational cost, limiting their scope of applications. In this study, we propose a novel EEG person identification approach using spiking neural networks (SNNs) with a lightweight spiking transformer for efficiency and effectiveness. The proposed SNN model is capable of handling the temporal complexities inherent in EEG signals. On the EEG-Music Emotion Recognition Challenge dataset, the proposed model achieves 100% classification accuracy with less than 10% energy consumption of traditional deep neural networks. This study offers a promising direction for energy-efficient and high-performance BCIs. The source code is available at https://github.com/PatrickZLin/Decode-ListenerIdentity.</description>

      <title>From Flows to Words: Can Zero-/Few-Shot LLMs Detect Network Intrusions? A Grammar-Constrained, Calibrated Evaluation on UNSW-NB15</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can reason over natural-language inputs, but their role in intrusion detection without fine-tuning remains uncertain. This study evaluates a prompt-only approach on UNSW-NB15 by converting each network flow to a compact textual record and augmenting it with lightweight, domain-inspired boolean flags (asymmetry, burst rate, TTL irregularities, timer anomalies, rare service/state, short bursts). To reduce output drift and support measurement, the model is constrained to produce structured, grammar-valid responses, and a single decision threshold is calibrated on a small development split. We compare zero-shot, instruction-guided, and few-shot prompting to strong tabular and neural baselines under identical splits, reporting accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and macro scores. Empirically, unguided prompting is unreliable, while instructions plus flags substantially improve detection quality; adding calibrated scoring further stabilizes results. On a balanced subset of two hundred flows, a 7B instruction-tuned model with flags reaches macro-F1 near 0.78; a lighter 3B model with few-shot cues and calibration attains F1 near 0.68 on one thousand examples. As the evaluation set grows to two thousand flows, decision quality decreases, revealing sensitivity to coverage and prompting. Tabular baselines remain more stable and faster, yet the prompt-only pipeline requires no gradient training, produces readable artifacts, and adapts easily through instructions and flags. Contributions include a flow-to-text protocol with interpretable cues, a calibration method for thresholding, a systematic baseline comparison, and a reproducibility bundle with prompts, grammar, metrics, and figures.</description>

      <title>When Intelligence Fails: An Empirical Study on Why LLMs Struggle with Password Cracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language understanding and generation have sparked interest in their potential for cybersecurity applications, including password guessing. In this study, we conduct an empirical investigation into the efficacy of pre-trained LLMs for password cracking using synthetic user profiles. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art open-source LLMs such as TinyLLaMA, Falcon-RW-1B, and Flan-T5 by prompting them to generate plausible passwords based on structured user attributes (e.g., name, birthdate, hobbies). Our results, measured using Hit@1, Hit@5, and Hit@10 metrics under both plaintext and SHA-256 hash comparisons, reveal consistently poor performance, with all models achieving less than 1.5% accuracy at Hit@10. In contrast, traditional rule-based and combinator-based cracking methods demonstrate significantly higher success rates. Through detailed analysis and visualization, we identify key limitations in the generative reasoning of LLMs when applied to the domain-specific task of password guessing. Our findings suggest that, despite their linguistic prowess, current LLMs lack the domain adaptation and memorization capabilities required for effective password inference, especially in the absence of supervised fine-tuning on leaked password datasets. This study provides critical insights into the limitations of LLMs in adversarial contexts and lays the groundwork for future efforts in secure, privacy-preserving, and robust password modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider tensor factorizations based on sparse measurements of the tensor components. The measurements are designed in a way that the underlying graph of interactions is a random graph. The setup will be useful in cases where a substantial amount of data is missing, as in recommendation systems heavily used in social network services. In order to obtain theoretical insights on the setup, we consider statistical inference of the tensor factorization in a high dimensional limit, which we call as dense limit, where the graphs are large and dense but not fully connected. We build message-passing algorithms and test them in a Bayes optimal teacher-student setting. We also develop a replica theory, which becomes exact in the dense limit,to examine the performance of statistical inference.</description>

We introduce TritonRL, a domain-specialized LLM for Triton kernel generation, trained with a novel training framework that enables robust and automated kernel synthesis. Unlike general-purpose programming languages, Triton kernel generation faces unique challenges due to data scarcity and incomplete evaluation criteria, vulnerable to reward hacking. Our approach addresses these challenges end-to-end by distilling Triton-specific knowledge through supervised fine-tuning on curated datasets, and further improving code quality via reinforcement learning (RL) with robust, verifiable rewards and hierarchical reward assignment. Our RL framework robustly detects reward hacking and guides both reasoning traces and code tokens through fine-grained verification and hierarchical reward decomposition, enabling the model to generate high-quality Triton kernels that can truly replace existing modules. With robust and fine-grained evaluation, our experiments on KernelBench demonstrate that TritonRL achieves state-of-the-art correctness and speedup, surpassing all other Triton-specific models and underscoring the effectiveness of our RL-based training paradigm.</description>

      <title>Learning Time-Varying Graphs from Incomplete Graph Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the challenging problem of jointly inferring time-varying network topologies and imputing missing data from partially observed graph signals. We propose a unified non-convex optimization framework to simultaneously recover a sequence of graph Laplacian matrices while reconstructing the unobserved signal entries. Unlike conventional decoupled methods, our integrated approach facilitates a bidirectional flow of information between the graph and signal domains, yielding superior robustness, particularly in high missing-data regimes. To capture realistic network dynamics, we introduce a fused-lasso type regularizer on the sequence of Laplacians. This penalty promotes temporal smoothness by penalizing large successive changes, thereby preventing spurious variations induced by noise while still permitting gradual topological evolution. For solving the joint optimization problem, we develop an efficient Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, which leverages the problem's structure to yield closed-form solutions for both the graph and signal subproblems. This design ensures scalability to large-scale networks and long time horizons. On the theoretical front, despite the inherent non-convexity, we establish a convergence guarantee, proving that the proposed ADMM scheme converges to a stationary point. Furthermore, we derive non-asymptotic statistical guarantees, providing high-probability error bounds for the graph estimator as a function of sample size, signal smoothness, and the intrinsic temporal variability of the graph. Extensive numerical experiments validate the approach, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both convergence speed and the joint accuracy of graph learning and signal recovery.</description>

      <title>Self-Evidencing Through Hierarchical Gradient Decomposition: A Dissipative System That Maintains Non-Equilibrium Steady-State by Minimizing Variational Free Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Free Energy Principle (FEP) states that self-organizing systems must minimize variational free energy to persist, but the path from principle to implementable algorithm has remained unclear. We present a constructive proof that the FEP can be realized through exact local credit assignment. The system decomposes gradient computation hierarchically: spatial credit via feedback alignment, temporal credit via eligibility traces, and structural credit via a Trophic Field Map (TFM) that estimates expected gradient magnitude for each connection block. We prove these mechanisms are exact at their respective levels and validate the central claim empirically: the TFM achieves 0.9693 Pearson correlation with oracle gradients. This exactness produces emergent capabilities including 98.6% retention after task interference, autonomous recovery from 75% structural damage, self-organized criticality (spectral radius p ~= 1.0$), and sample-efficient reinforcement learning on continuous control tasks without replay buffers. The architecture unifies Prigogine's dissipative structures, Friston's free energy minimization, and Hopfield's attractor dynamics, demonstrating that exact hierarchical inference over network topology can be implemented with local, biologically plausible rules.</description>

      <title>XDXD: End-to-end crystal structure determination with low resolution X-ray diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining crystal structures from X-ray diffraction data is fundamental across diverse scientific fields, yet remains a significant challenge when data is limited to low resolution. While recent deep learning models have made breakthroughs in solving the crystallographic phase problem, the resulting low-resolution electron density maps are often ambiguous and difficult to interpret. To overcome this critical bottleneck, we introduce XDXD, to our knowledge, the first end-to-end deep learning framework to determine a complete atomic model directly from low-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. Our diffusion-based generative model bypasses the need for manual map interpretation, producing chemically plausible crystal structures conditioned on the diffraction pattern. We demonstrate that XDXD achieves a 70.4\% match rate for structures with data limited to 2.0~\AA{} resolution, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) below 0.05. Evaluated on a benchmark of 24,000 experimental structures, our model proves to be robust and accurate. Furthermore, a case study on small peptides highlights the model's potential for extension to more complex systems, paving the way for automated structure solution in previously intractable cases.</description>

      <title>PLAGUE: Plug-and-play framework for Lifelong Adaptive Generation of Multi-turn Exploits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are improving at an exceptional rate. With the advent of agentic workflows, multi-turn dialogue has become the de facto mode of interaction with LLMs for completing long and complex tasks. While LLM capabilities continue to improve, they remain increasingly susceptible to jailbreaking, especially in multi-turn scenarios where harmful intent can be subtly injected across the conversation to produce nefarious outcomes. While single-turn attacks have been extensively explored, adaptability, efficiency and effectiveness continue to remain key challenges for their multi-turn counterparts. To address these gaps, we present PLAGUE, a novel plug-and-play framework for designing multi-turn attacks inspired by lifelong-learning agents. PLAGUE dissects the lifetime of a multi-turn attack into three carefully designed phases (Primer, Planner and Finisher) that enable a systematic and information-rich exploration of the multi-turn attack family. Evaluations show that red-teaming agents designed using PLAGUE achieve state-of-the-art jailbreaking results, improving attack success rates (ASR) by more than 30% across leading models in a lesser or comparable query budget. Particularly, PLAGUE enables an ASR (based on StrongReject) of 81.4% on OpenAI's o3 and 67.3% on Claude's Opus 4.1, two models that are considered highly resistant to jailbreaks in safety literature. Our work offers tools and insights to understand the importance of plan initialization, context optimization and lifelong learning in crafting multi-turn attacks for a comprehensive model vulnerability evaluation.</description>

      <title>Universal Spectral Tokenization via Self-Supervised Panchromatic Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential scientific data span many resolutions and domains, and unifying them into a common representation is a key step toward developing foundation models for the sciences. Astronomical spectra exemplify this challenge: massive surveys have collected millions of spectra across a wide range of wavelengths and resolutions, yet analyses remain fragmented across spectral domains (e.g., optical vs. infrared) and object types (e.g., stars vs. galaxies), limiting the ability to pool information across datasets. We present a deep learning model that jointly learns from heterogeneous spectra in a self-supervised manner. Our universal spectral tokenizer processes spectra from a variety of object types and resolutions directly on their native wavelength grids, producing intrinsically aligned, homogeneous, and physically meaningful representations that can be efficiently adapted to achieve competitive performance across a range of downstream tasks. For the first time, we demonstrate that a single model can unify spectral data across resolutions and domains, suggesting that our model can serve as a powerful building block for foundation models in astronomy -- and potentially extend to other scientific domains with heterogeneous sequential data, such as climate and healthcare.</description>

      <title>QINNs: Quantum-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical deep neural networks can learn rich multi-particle correlations in collider data, but their inductive biases are rarely anchored in physics structure. We propose quantum-informed neural networks (QINNs), a general framework that brings quantum information concepts and quantum observables into purely classical models. While the framework is broad, in this paper, we study one concrete realisation that encodes each particle as a qubit and uses the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) as a compact, basis-independent summary of particle correlations. Using jet tagging as a case study, QFIMs act as lightweight embeddings in graph neural networks, increasing model expressivity and plasticity. The QFIM reveals distinct patterns for QCD and hadronic top jets that align with physical expectations. Thus, QINNs offer a practical, interpretable, and scalable route to quantum-informed analyses, that is, tomography, of particle collisions, particularly by enhancing well-established deep learning approaches.</description>

      <title>SimBA: Simplifying Benchmark Analysis Using Performance Matrices Alone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern language models are evaluated on large benchmarks, which are difficult to make sense of, especially for model selection. Looking at the raw evaluation numbers themselves using a model-centric lens, we propose SimBA, a three phase framework to Simplify Benchmark Analysis. The three phases of SimBA are: stalk, where we conduct dataset &amp; model comparisons, prowl, where we discover a representative subset, and pounce, where we use the representative subset to predict performance on a held-out set of models. Applying SimBA to three popular LM benchmarks: HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite reveals that across all three benchmarks, datasets and models relate strongly to one another (stalk). We develop an representative set discovery algorithm which covers a benchmark using raw evaluation scores alone. Using our algorithm, we find that with 6.25% (1/16), 1.7% (1/58), and 28.4% (21/74) of the datasets for HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite respectively, we achieve coverage levels of at least 95% (prowl). Additionally, using just these representative subsets, we can both preserve model ranks and predict performance on a held-out set of models with near zero mean-squared error (pounce). Taken together, SimBA can help model developers improve efficiency during model training and dataset creators validate whether their newly created dataset differs from existing datasets in a benchmark. Our code is open source, available at https://github.com/nishantsubramani/simba.</description>

      <title>ViBED-Net: Video Based Engagement Detection Network Using Face-Aware and Scene-Aware Spatiotemporal Cues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engagement detection in online learning environments is vital for improving student outcomes and personalizing instruction. We present ViBED-Net (Video-Based Engagement Detection Network), a novel deep learning framework designed to assess student engagement from video data using a dual-stream architecture. ViBED-Net captures both facial expressions and full-scene context by processing facial crops and entire video frames through EfficientNetV2 for spatial feature extraction. These features are then analyzed over time using two temporal modeling strategies: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Transformer encoders. Our model is evaluated on the DAiSEE dataset, a large-scale benchmark for affective state recognition in e-learning. To enhance performance on underrepresented engagement classes, we apply targeted data augmentation techniques. Among the tested variants, ViBED-Net with LSTM achieves 73.43\% accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. ViBED-Net demonstrates that combining face-aware and scene-aware spatiotemporal cues significantly improves engagement detection accuracy. Its modular design allows flexibility for application across education, user experience research, and content personalization. This work advances video-based affective computing by offering a scalable, high-performing solution for real-world engagement analysis. The source code for this project is available on https://github.com/prateek-gothwal/ViBED-Net .</description>

      <title>From Local to Global: Revisiting Structured Pruning Paradigms for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structured pruning is a practical approach to deploying large language models (LLMs) efficiently, as it yields compact, hardware-friendly architectures. However, the dominant local paradigm is task-agnostic: by optimizing layer-wise reconstruction rather than task objectives, it tends to preserve perplexity or generic zero-shot behavior but fails to capitalize on modest task-specific calibration signals, often yielding limited downstream gains. We revisit global structured pruning and present GISP-Global Iterative Structured Pruning-a post-training method that removes attention heads and MLP channels using first-order, loss-based important weights aggregated at the structure level with block-wise normalization. An iterative schedule, rather than one-shot pruning, stabilizes accuracy at higher sparsity and mitigates perplexity collapse without requiring intermediate fine-tuning; the pruning trajectory also forms nested subnetworks that support a "prune-once, deploy-many" workflow. Furthermore, because importance is defined by a model-level loss, GISP naturally supports task-specific objectives; we instantiate perplexity for language modeling and a margin-based objective for decision-style tasks. Extensive experiments show that across Llama2-7B/13B, Llama3-8B, and Mistral-0.3-7B, GISP consistently lowers WikiText-2 perplexity and improves downstream accuracy, with especially strong gains at 40-50% sparsity; on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-3-8B with GSM8K, task-aligned calibration substantially boosts exact-match accuracy.</description>

      <title>Transformer Redesign for Late Fusion of Audio-Text Features on Ultra-Low-Power Edge Hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying emotion recognition systems in real-world environments where devices must be small, low-power, and private remains a significant challenge. This is especially relevant for applications such as tension monitoring, conflict de-escalation, and responsive wearables, where cloud-based solutions are impractical. Multimodal emotion recognition has advanced through deep learning, but most systems remain unsuitable for deployment on ultra-constrained edge devices. Prior work typically relies on powerful hardware, lacks real-time performance, or uses unimodal input. This paper addresses that gap by presenting a hardware-aware emotion recognition system that combines acoustic and linguistic features using a late-fusion architecture optimised for Edge TPU. The design integrates a quantised transformer-based acoustic model with frozen keyword embeddings from a DSResNet-SE network, enabling real-time inference within a 1.8MB memory budget and 21-23ms latency. The pipeline ensures spectrogram alignment between training and deployment using MicroFrontend and MLTK. Evaluation on re-recorded, segmented IEMOCAP samples captured through the Coral Dev Board Micro microphone shows a 6.3% macro F1 improvement over unimodal baselines. This work demonstrates that accurate, real-time multimodal emotion inference is achievable on microcontroller-class edge platforms through task-specific fusion and hardware-guided model design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The red palm mite infestation has become a serious concern, particularly in regions with extensive palm cultivation, leading to reduced productivity and economic losses. Accurate and early identification of mite-infested plants is critical for effective management. The current study focuses on evaluating and comparing the ML model for classifying the affected plants and detecting the infestation. TriggerNet is a novel interpretable AI framework that integrates Grad-CAM, RISE, FullGrad, and TCAV to generate novel visual explanations for deep learning models in plant classification and disease detection. This study applies TriggerNet to address red palm mite (Raoiella indica) infestation, a major threat to palm cultivation and agricultural productivity. A diverse set of RGB images across 11 plant species, Arecanut, Date Palm, Bird of Paradise, Coconut Palm, Ginger, Citrus Tree, Palm Oil, Orchid, Banana Palm, Avocado Tree, and Cast Iron Plant was utilized for training and evaluation. Advanced deep learning models like CNN, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ViT, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, alongside machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, SVM, and KNN, were employed for plant classification. For disease classification, all plants were categorized into four classes: Healthy, Yellow Spots, Reddish Bronzing, and Silk Webbing. Snorkel was used to efficiently label these disease classes by leveraging heuristic rules and patterns, reducing manual annotation time and improving dataset reliability.</description>

      <title>Fast Agnostic Learners in the Plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the computational efficiency of agnostic learning for several fundamental geometric concept classes in the plane. While the sample complexity of agnostic learning is well understood, its time complexity has received much less attention. We study the class of triangles and, more generally, the class of convex polygons with $k$ vertices for small $k$, as well as the class of convex sets in a square. We present a proper agnostic learner for the class of triangles that has optimal sample complexity and runs in time $\tilde O({\epsilon^{-6}})$, improving on the algorithm of Dobkin and Gunopulos (COLT `95) that runs in time $\tilde O({\epsilon^{-10}})$. For 4-gons and 5-gons, we improve the running time from $O({\epsilon^{-12}})$, achieved by Fischer and Kwek (eCOLT `96), to $\tilde O({\epsilon^{-8}})$ and $\tilde O({\epsilon^{-10}})$, respectively.
  We also design a proper agnostic learner for convex sets under the uniform distribution over a square with running time $\tilde O({\epsilon^{-5}})$, improving on the previous $\tilde O(\epsilon^{-8})$ bound at the cost of slightly higher sample complexity. Notably, agnostic learning of convex sets in $[0,1]^2$ under general distributions is impossible because this concept class has infinite VC-dimension. Our agnostic learners use data structures and algorithms from computational geometry and their analysis relies on tools from geometry and probabilistic combinatorics. Because our learners are proper, they yield tolerant property testers with matching running times. Our results raise a fundamental question of whether a gap between the sample and time complexity is inherent for agnostic learning of these and other natural concept classes.</description>

Abstract: Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) has been increasingly employed in health technology assessments (HTA). By reweighting subjects from a trial with individual participant data (IPD) to match the covariate summary statistics of another trial with only aggregate data (AgD), MAIC facilitates the estimation of a treatment effect defined with respect to the AgD trial population. This manuscript introduces a new class of methods, termed arbitrated indirect treatment comparisons, designed to address the ``MAIC paradox'' -- a phenomenon highlighted by Jiang et al.~(2025). The MAIC paradox arises when different sponsors, analyzing the same data, reach conflicting conclusions regarding which treatment is more effective. The underlying issue is that each sponsor implicitly targets a different population. To resolve this inconsistency, the proposed methods focus on estimating treatment effects in a common target population, specifically chosen to be the overlap population.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Vision Transformers with Adaptive Patch Sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) partition input images into uniformly sized patches regardless of their content, resulting in long input sequence lengths for high-resolution images. We present Adaptive Patch Transformers (APT), which addresses this by using multiple different patch sizes within the same image. APT reduces the total number of input tokens by allocating larger patch sizes in more homogeneous areas and smaller patches in more complex ones. APT achieves a drastic speedup in ViT inference and training, increasing throughput by 40% on ViT-L and 50% on ViT-H while maintaining downstream performance, and can be applied to a previously fine-tuned ViT, converging in as little as 1 epoch. It also significantly reduces training and inference time without loss of performance in high-resolution dense visual tasks, achieving up to 30\% faster training and inference in visual QA, object detection, and semantic segmentation.</description>

      <title>From AutoRecSys to AutoRecLab: A Call to Build, Evaluate, and Govern Autonomous Recommender-Systems Research Labs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender-systems research has accelerated model and evaluation advances, yet largely neglects automating the research process itself. We argue for a shift from narrow AutoRecSys tools -- focused on algorithm selection and hyper-parameter tuning -- to an Autonomous Recommender-Systems Research Lab (AutoRecLab) that integrates end-to-end automation: problem ideation, literature analysis, experimental design and execution, result interpretation, manuscript drafting, and provenance logging. Drawing on recent progress in automated science (e.g., multi-agent AI Scientist and AI Co-Scientist systems), we outline an agenda for the RecSys community: (1) build open AutoRecLab prototypes that combine LLM-driven ideation and reporting with automated experimentation; (2) establish benchmarks and competitions that evaluate agents on producing reproducible RecSys findings with minimal human input; (3) create review venues for transparently AI-generated submissions; (4) define standards for attribution and reproducibility via detailed research logs and metadata; and (5) foster interdisciplinary dialogue on ethics, governance, privacy, and fairness in autonomous research. Advancing this agenda can increase research throughput, surface non-obvious insights, and position RecSys to contribute to emerging Artificial Research Intelligence. We conclude with a call to organise a community retreat to coordinate next steps and co-author guidance for the responsible integration of automated research systems.</description>

      <title>PrivaDE: Privacy-preserving Data Evaluation for Blockchain-based Data Marketplaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the relevance of data is a critical task for model builders seeking to acquire datasets that enhance model performance. Ideally, such evaluation should allow the model builder to assess the utility of candidate data without exposing proprietary details of the model. At the same time, data providers must be assured that no information about their data - beyond the computed utility score - is disclosed to the model builder.
  In this paper, we present PrivaDE, a cryptographic protocol for privacy-preserving utility scoring and selection of data for machine learning. While prior works have proposed data evaluation protocols, our approach advances the state of the art through a practical, blockchain-centric design. Leveraging the trustless nature of blockchains, PrivaDE enforces malicious-security guarantees and ensures strong privacy protection for both models and datasets. To achieve efficiency, we integrate several techniques - including model distillation, model splitting, and cut-and-choose zero-knowledge proofs - bringing the runtime to a practical level. Furthermore, we propose a unified utility scoring function that combines empirical loss, predictive entropy, and feature-space diversity, and that can be seamlessly integrated into active-learning workflows. Evaluation shows that PrivaDE performs data evaluation effectively, achieving online runtimes within 15 minutes even for models with millions of parameters.
  Our work lays the foundation for fair and automated data marketplaces in decentralized machine learning ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Generalization Below the Edge of Stability: The Role of Data Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding generalization in overparameterized neural networks hinges on the interplay between the data geometry, neural architecture, and training dynamics. In this paper, we theoretically explore how data geometry controls this implicit bias. This paper presents theoretical results for overparameterized two-layer ReLU networks trained below the edge of stability. First, for data distributions supported on a mixture of low-dimensional balls, we derive generalization bounds that provably adapt to the intrinsic dimension. Second, for a family of isotropic distributions that vary in how strongly probability mass concentrates toward the unit sphere, we derive a spectrum of bounds showing that rates deteriorate as the mass concentrates toward the sphere. These results instantiate a unifying principle: When the data is harder to "shatter" with respect to the activation thresholds of the ReLU neurons, gradient descent tends to learn representations that capture shared patterns and thus finds solutions that generalize well. On the other hand, for data that is easily shattered (e.g., data supported on the sphere) gradient descent favors memorization. Our theoretical results consolidate disparate empirical findings that have appeared in the literature.</description>

      <title>Learning from Generalization Patterns: An Evaluation-Driven Approach to Enhanced Data Augmentation for Fine-Tuning Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer compelling advantages in deployment cost and latency, but their accuracy often lags behind larger models, particularly for complex domain-specific tasks. While supervised fine-tuning can help bridge this performance gap, it requires substantial manual effort in data preparation and iterative optimization. We present PaDA-Agent (Pattern-guided Data Augmentation Agent), an evaluation-driven approach that streamlines the data augmentation process for SLMs through coordinated operations. Unlike state-of-the-art approaches that focus on model training errors only and generating error-correcting samples, PaDA-Agent discovers failure patterns from the validation data via evaluations and drafts targeted data augmentation strategies aiming to directly reduce the generalization gap. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art LLM-based data augmentation approaches for Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Extracting Rule-based Descriptions of Attention Features in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability strives to explain model behavior in terms of bottom-up primitives. The leading paradigm is to express hidden states as a sparse linear combination of basis vectors, called features. However, this only identifies which text sequences (exemplars) activate which features; the actual interpretation of features requires subjective inspection of these exemplars. This paper advocates for a different solution: rule-based descriptions that match token patterns in the input and correspondingly increase or decrease the likelihood of specific output tokens. Specifically, we extract rule-based descriptions of SAE features trained on the outputs of attention layers. While prior work treats the attention layers as an opaque box, we describe how it may naturally be expressed in terms of interactions between input and output features, of which we study three types: (1) skip-gram rules of the form "[Canadian city]... speaks --&gt; English", (2) absence rules of the form "[Montreal]... speaks -/-&gt; English," and (3) counting rules that toggle only when the count of a word exceeds a certain value or the count of another word. Absence and counting rules are not readily discovered by inspection of exemplars, where manual and automatic descriptions often identify misleading or incomplete explanations. We then describe a simple approach to extract these types of rules automatically from a transformer, and apply it to GPT-2 small. We find that a majority of features may be described well with around 100 skip-gram rules, though absence rules are abundant even as early as the first layer (in over a fourth of features). We also isolate a few examples of counting rules. This paper lays the groundwork for future research into rule-based descriptions of features by defining them, showing how they may be extracted, and providing a preliminary taxonomy of some of the behaviors they represent.</description>

      <title>Beating the Winner's Curse via Inference-Aware Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a surge of recent interest in automatically learning policies to target treatment decisions based on rich individual covariates. A common approach is to train a machine learning model to predict counterfactual outcomes, and then select the policy that optimizes the predicted objective value. In addition, practitioners also want confidence that the learned policy has better performance than the incumbent policy according to downstream policy evaluation. However, due to the winner's curse-an issue where the policy optimization procedure exploits prediction errors rather than finding actual improvements-predicted performance improvements are often not substantiated by downstream policy optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a novel strategy called inference-aware policy optimization, which modifies policy optimization to account for how the policy will be evaluated downstream. Specifically, it optimizes not only for the estimated objective value, but also for the chances that the policy will be statistically significantly better than the observational policy used to collect data. We mathematically characterize the Pareto frontier of policies according to the tradeoff of these two goals. Based on our characterization, we design a policy optimization algorithm that uses machine learning to predict counterfactual outcomes, and then plugs in these predictions to estimate the Pareto frontier; then, the decision-maker can select the policy that optimizes their desired tradeoff, after which policy evaluation can be performed on the test set as usual. Finally, we perform simulations to illustrate the effectiveness of our methodology.</description>

      <title>Saber: An Efficient Sampling with Adaptive Acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced Remasking for Diffusion Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) are emerging as a powerful and promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive paradigm, offering inherent advantages in parallel generation and bidirectional context modeling. However, the performance of DLMs on code generation tasks, which have stronger structural constraints, is significantly hampered by the critical trade-off between inference speed and output quality. We observed that accelerating the code generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads to a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce efficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced Remasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to achieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation. Specifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation process: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is established; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks show that Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by an average improvement of 1.9% over mainstream DLM sampling methods, meanwhile achieving an average 251.4% inference speedup. By leveraging the inherent advantages of DLMs, our work significantly narrows the performance gap with autoregressive models in code generation.</description>

      <title>AgentChangeBench: A Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Framework for Goal-Shift Robustness in Conversational AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Goal changes are a defining feature of real world multi-turn interactions, yet current agent benchmarks primarily evaluate static objectives or one-shot tool use. We introduce AgentChangeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to measure how tool augmented language model agents adapt to mid dialogue goal shifts across three enterprise domains. Our framework formalizes evaluation through four complementary metrics: Task Success Rate (TSR) for effectiveness, Tool Use Efficiency (TUE) for reliability, Tool Call Redundancy Rate (TCRR) for wasted effort, and Goal-Shift Recovery Time (GSRT) for adaptation latency. AgentChangeBench comprises 2,835 task sequences and five user personas, each designed to trigger realistic shift points in ongoing workflows. Using this setup, we evaluate several frontier models and uncover sharp contrasts obscured by traditional $\text{pass}@k$ scores: for example, GPT-4o reaches $92.2\%$ recovery on airline booking shifts while Gemini collapses to $48.6\%$, and retail tasks show near perfect parameter validity yet redundancy rates above $80\%$, revealing major inefficiencies. These findings demonstrate that high raw accuracy does not imply robustness under dynamic goals, and that explicit measurement of recovery time and redundancy is essential. AgentChangeBench establishes a reproducible testbed for diagnosing and improving agent resilience in realistic enterprise settings.</description>

      <title>Local Coherence or Global Validity? Investigating RLVR Traces in Math Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)-based post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been shown to improve accuracy on reasoning tasks and continues to attract significant attention. Existing RLVR methods, however, typically treat all tokens uniformly without accounting for token-level advantages. These methods primarily evaluate performance based on final answer correctness or Pass@K accuracy, and yet make claims about RL post-training leading to improved reasoning traces. This motivates our investigation into the effect of RL post-training on intermediate tokens which are not directly incentivized. To study this, we design an experimental setup using the GRPO algorithm with Qwen-2.5-0.5B model on the GSM8K dataset. We introduce trace coherence, a First-Order Logic (FOL)-based measure to capture the consistency of reasoning steps by identifying errors in the traces. We distinguish between trace validity and trace coherence, noting that the former implies logical soundness while the latter measures local coherence via lack of errors. Our results show that RL post-training overall improves trace coherence with the most significant gains on problems where the base model fails but the RL model succeeds. Surprisingly, RL enhances local coherence without necessarily producing valid or correct solutions. This highlights a crucial distinction: improved local coherence in reasoning steps does not guarantee final answer correctness. We argue that claims of improved reasoning via RL must be examined with care, as these may be based on improved trace coherence, which may not translate into fully valid mathematical proofs.</description>

      <title>Joint Estimation of Piano Dynamics and Metrical Structure with a Multi-task Multi-Scale Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating piano dynamic from audio recordings is a fundamental challenge in computational music analysis. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-task network that jointly predicts dynamic levels, change points, beats, and downbeats from a shared latent representation. These four targets form the metrical structure of dynamics in the music score. Inspired by recent vocal dynamic research, we use a multi-scale network as the backbone, which takes Bark-scale specific loudness as the input feature. Compared to log-Mel as input, this reduces model size from 14.7 M to 0.5 M, enabling long sequential input. We use a 60-second audio length in audio segmentation, which doubled the length of beat tracking commonly used. Evaluated on the public MazurkaBL dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across all tasks. This work sets a new benchmark for piano dynamic estimation and delivers a powerful and compact tool, paving the way for large-scale, resource-efficient analysis of musical expression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fair, transparent, and explainable decision-making remains a critical challenge in Olympic and Paralympic combat sports. This paper presents \emph{FST.ai 2.0}, an explainable AI ecosystem designed to support referees, coaches, and athletes in real time during Taekwondo competitions and training. The system integrates {pose-based action recognition} using graph convolutional networks (GCNs), {epistemic uncertainty modeling} through credal sets, and {explainability overlays} for visual decision support. A set of {interactive dashboards} enables human--AI collaboration in referee evaluation, athlete performance analysis, and Para-Taekwondo classification. Beyond automated scoring, FST.ai~2.0 incorporates modules for referee training, fairness monitoring, and policy-level analytics within the World Taekwondo ecosystem. Experimental validation on competition data demonstrates an {85\% reduction in decision review time} and {93\% referee trust} in AI-assisted decisions. The framework thus establishes a transparent and extensible pipeline for trustworthy, data-driven officiating and athlete assessment. By bridging real-time perception, explainable inference, and governance-aware design, FST.ai~2.0 represents a step toward equitable, accountable, and human-aligned AI in sports.</description>

      <title>RESCUE: Retrieval Augmented Secure Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advances, Large Language Models (LLMs) still generate vulnerable code. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has the potential to enhance LLMs for secure code generation by incorporating external security knowledge. However, the conventional RAG design struggles with the noise of raw security-related documents, and existing retrieval methods overlook the significant security semantics implicitly embedded in task descriptions. To address these issues, we propose RESCUE, a new RAG framework for secure code generation with two key innovations. First, we propose a hybrid knowledge base construction method that combines LLM-assisted cluster-then-summarize distillation with program slicing, producing both high-level security guidelines and concise, security-focused code examples. Second, we design a hierarchical multi-faceted retrieval to traverse the constructed knowledge base from top to bottom and integrates multiple security-critical facts at each hierarchical level, ensuring comprehensive and accurate retrieval. We evaluated RESCUE on four benchmarks and compared it with five state-of-the-art secure code generation methods on six LLMs. The results demonstrate that RESCUE improves the SecurePass@1 metric by an average of 4.8 points, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance for security. Furthermore, we performed in-depth analysis and ablation studies to rigorously validate the effectiveness of individual components in RESCUE.</description>

      <title>A Definition of AGI</title>

Abstract: The lack of a concrete definition for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) obscures the gap between today's specialized AI and human-level cognition. This paper introduces a quantifiable framework to address this, defining AGI as matching the cognitive versatility and proficiency of a well-educated adult. To operationalize this, we ground our methodology in Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory, the most empirically validated model of human cognition. The framework dissects general intelligence into ten core cognitive domains-including reasoning, memory, and perception-and adapts established human psychometric batteries to evaluate AI systems. Application of this framework reveals a highly "jagged" cognitive profile in contemporary models. While proficient in knowledge-intensive domains, current AI systems have critical deficits in foundational cognitive machinery, particularly long-term memory storage. The resulting AGI scores (e.g., GPT-4 at 27%, GPT-5 at 58%) concretely quantify both rapid progress and the substantial gap remaining before AGI.</description>

      <title>VLSU: Mapping the Limits of Joint Multimodal Understanding for AI Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety evaluation of multimodal foundation models often treats vision and language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns. Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories. Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to 53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language safety.</description>

      <title>The Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Data-Driven Optimization: A Local Misspecification Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven stochastic optimization is ubiquitous in machine learning and operational decision-making problems. Sample average approximation (SAA) and model-based approaches such as estimate-then-optimize (ETO) or integrated estimation-optimization (IEO) are all popular, with model-based approaches being able to circumvent some of the issues with SAA in complex context-dependent problems. Yet the relative performance of these methods is poorly understood, with most results confined to the dichotomous cases of the model-based approach being either well-specified or misspecified. We develop the first results that allow for a more granular analysis of the relative performance of these methods under a local misspecification setting, which models the scenario where the model-based approach is nearly well-specified. By leveraging tools from contiguity theory in statistics, we show that there is a bias-variance tradeoff between SAA, IEO, and ETO under local misspecification, and that the relative importance of the bias and the variance depends on the degree of local misspecification. Moreover, we derive explicit expressions for the decision bias, which allows us to characterize (un)impactful misspecification directions, and provide further geometric understanding of the variance.</description>

      <title>LIME: Link-based user-item Interaction Modeling with decoupled xor attention for Efficient test time scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling large recommendation systems requires advancing three major frontiers: processing longer user histories, expanding candidate sets, and increasing model capacity. While promising, transformers' computational cost scales quadratically with the user sequence length and linearly with the number of candidates. This trade-off makes it prohibitively expensive to expand candidate sets or increase sequence length at inference, despite the significant performance improvements.
  We introduce \textbf{LIME}, a novel architecture that resolves this trade-off. Through two key innovations, LIME fundamentally reduces computational complexity. First, low-rank ``link embeddings" enable pre-computation of attention weights by decoupling user and candidate interactions, making the inference cost nearly independent of candidate set size. Second, a linear attention mechanism, \textbf{LIME-XOR}, reduces the complexity with respect to user sequence length from quadratic ($O(N^2)$) to linear ($O(N)$).
  Experiments on public and industrial datasets show LIME achieves near-parity with state-of-the-art transformers but with a 10$\times$ inference speedup on large candidate sets or long sequence lengths. When tested on a major recommendation platform, LIME improved user engagement while maintaining minimal inference costs with respect to candidate set size and user history length, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and expressive recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Finding the Sweet Spot: Optimal Data Augmentation Ratio for Imbalanced Credit Scoring Using ADASYN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Credit scoring models face a critical challenge: severe class imbalance, with default rates typically below 10%, which hampers model learning and predictive performance. While synthetic data augmentation techniques such as SMOTE and ADASYN have been proposed to address this issue, the optimal augmentation ratio remains unclear, with practitioners often defaulting to full balancing (1:1 ratio) without empirical justification.
  This study systematically evaluates 10 data augmentation scenarios using the Give Me Some Credit dataset (97,243 observations, 7% default rate), comparing SMOTE, BorderlineSMOTE, and ADASYN at different multiplication factors (1x, 2x, 3x). All models were trained using XGBoost and evaluated on a held-out test set of 29,173 real observations. Statistical significance was assessed using bootstrap testing with 1,000 iterations.
  Key findings reveal that ADASYN with 1x multiplication (doubling the minority class) achieved optimal performance with AUC of 0.6778 and Gini coefficient of 0.3557, representing statistically significant improvements of +0.77% and +3.00% respectively (p = 0.017, bootstrap test). Higher multiplication factors (2x and 3x) resulted in performance degradation, with 3x showing a -0.48% decrease in AUC, suggesting a "law of diminishing returns" for synthetic oversampling. The optimal class imbalance ratio was found to be 6.6:1 (majority:minority), contradicting the common practice of balancing to 1:1.
  This work provides the first empirical evidence of an optimal "sweet spot" for data augmentation in credit scoring, with practical guidelines for industry practitioners and researchers working with imbalanced datasets. While demonstrated on a single representative dataset, the methodology provides a reproducible framework for determining optimal augmentation ratios in other imbalanced domains.</description>

      <title>Illusions of reflection: open-ended task reveals systematic failures in Large Language Models' reflective reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans do not just find mistakes after the fact -- we often catch them mid-stream because 'reflection' is tied to the goal and its constraints. Today's large language models produce reasoning tokens and 'reflective' text, but is it functionally equivalent with human reflective reasoning? Prior work on closed-ended tasks -- with clear, external 'correctness' signals -- can make 'reflection' look effective while masking limits in self-correction. We therefore test eight frontier models on a simple, real-world task that is open-ended yet rule-constrained, with auditable success criteria: to produce valid scientific test items, then revise after considering their own critique. First-pass performance is poor (often zero valid items out of 4 required; mean $\approx$ 1), and reflection yields only modest gains (also $\approx$ 1). Crucially, the second attempt frequently repeats the same violation of constraint, indicating 'corrective gains' arise largely from chance production of a valid item rather than error detection and principled, constraint-sensitive repair. Performance before and after reflection deteriorates as open-endedness increases, and models marketed for 'reasoning' show no advantage. Our results suggest that current LLM 'reflection' lacks functional evidence of the active, goal-driven monitoring that helps humans respect constraints even on a first pass. Until such mechanisms are instantiated in the model itself, reliable performance requires external structure that enforces constraints.</description>

      <title>Learning under Quantization for High-Dimensional Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of low-bit quantization has emerged as an indispensable technique for enabling the efficient training of large-scale models. Despite its widespread empirical success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its impact on learning performance remains notably absent, even in the simplest linear regression setting. We present the first systematic theoretical study of this fundamental question, analyzing finite-step stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for high-dimensional linear regression under a comprehensive range of quantization targets: data, labels, parameters, activations, and gradients. Our novel analytical framework establishes precise algorithm-dependent and data-dependent excess risk bounds that characterize how different quantization affects learning: parameter, activation, and gradient quantization amplify noise during training; data quantization distorts the data spectrum; and data and label quantization introduce additional approximation and quantized error. Crucially, we prove that for multiplicative quantization (with input-dependent quantization step), this spectral distortion can be eliminated, and for additive quantization (with constant quantization step), a beneficial scaling effect with batch size emerges. Furthermore, for common polynomial-decay data spectra, we quantitatively compare the risks of multiplicative and additive quantization, drawing a parallel to the comparison between FP and integer quantization methods. Our theory provides a powerful lens to characterize how quantization shapes the learning dynamics of optimization algorithms, paving the way to further explore learning theory under practical hardware constraints.</description>

      <title>SPIKE: Stable Physics-Informed Kernel Evolution Method for Solving Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Stable Physics-Informed Kernel Evolution (SPIKE) method for numerical computation of inviscid hyperbolic conservation laws. SPIKE resolves a fundamental paradox: how strong-form residual minimization can capture weak solutions containing discontinuities. SPIKE employs reproducing kernel representations with regularized parameter evolution, where Tikhonov regularization provides a smooth transition mechanism through shock formation, allowing the dynamics to traverse shock singularities. This approach automatically maintains conservation, tracks characteristics, and captures shocks satisfying Rankine-Hugoniot conditions within a unified framework requiring no explicit shock detection or artificial viscosity. Numerical validation across scalar and vector-valued conservation laws confirms the method's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Efficient Few-shot Identity Preserving Attribute Editing for 3D-aware Deep Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identity preserving editing of faces is a generative task that enables modifying the illumination, adding/removing eyeglasses, face aging, editing hairstyles, modifying expression etc., while preserving the identity of the face. Recent progress in 2D generative models have enabled photorealistic editing of faces using simple techniques leveraging the compositionality in GANs. However, identity preserving editing for 3D faces with a given set of attributes is a challenging task as the generative model must reason about view consistency from multiple poses and render a realistic 3D face. Further, 3D portrait editing requires large-scale attribute labelled datasets and presents a trade-off between editability in low-resolution and inflexibility to editing in high resolution. In this work, we aim to alleviate some of the constraints in editing 3D faces by identifying latent space directions that correspond to photorealistic edits. To address this, we present a method that builds on recent advancements in 3D-aware deep generative models and 2D portrait editing techniques to perform efficient few-shot identity preserving attribute editing for 3D-aware generative models. We aim to show from experimental results that using just ten or fewer labelled images of an attribute is sufficient to estimate edit directions in the latent space that correspond to 3D-aware attribute editing. In this work, we leverage an existing face dataset with masks to obtain the synthetic images for few attribute examples required for estimating the edit directions. Further, to demonstrate the linearity of edits, we investigate one-shot stylization by performing sequential editing and use the (2D) Attribute Style Manipulation (ASM) technique to investigate a continuous style manifold for 3D consistent identity preserving face aging.

Abstract: Large-scale GPU traces play a critical role in identifying performance bottlenecks within heterogeneous High-Performance Computing (HPC) architectures. However, the sheer volume and complexity of a single trace of data make performance analysis both computationally expensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we present an end-to-end parallel performance analysis framework designed to handle multiple large-scale GPU traces efficiently. Our proposed framework partitions and processes trace data concurrently and employs causal graph methods and parallel coordinating chart to expose performance variability and dependencies across execution flows. Experimental results demonstrate a 67% improvement in terms of scalability, highlighting the effectiveness of our pipeline for analyzing multiple traces independently.</description>

      <title>MoMaGen: Generating Demonstrations under Soft and Hard Constraints for Multi-Step Bimanual Mobile Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning from large-scale, diverse human demonstrations has proven effective for training robots, but collecting such data is costly and time-consuming. This challenge is amplified for multi-step bimanual mobile manipulation, where humans must teleoperate both a mobile base and two high-degree-of-freedom arms. Prior automated data generation frameworks have addressed static bimanual manipulation by augmenting a few human demonstrations in simulation, but they fall short for mobile settings due to two key challenges: (1) determining base placement to ensure reachability, and (2) positioning the camera to provide sufficient visibility for visuomotor policies. To address these issues, we introduce MoMaGen, which formulates data generation as a constrained optimization problem that enforces hard constraints (e.g., reachability) while balancing soft constraints (e.g., visibility during navigation). This formulation generalizes prior approaches and provides a principled foundation for future methods. We evaluate MoMaGen on four multi-step bimanual mobile manipulation tasks and show that it generates significantly more diverse datasets than existing methods. Leveraging this diversity, MoMaGen can train successful imitation learning policies from a single source demonstration, and these policies can be fine-tuned with as few as 40 real-world demonstrations to achieve deployment on physical robotic hardware. More details are available at our project page: momagen.github.io.</description>

      <title>Parametrising the Inhomogeneity Inducing Capacity of a Training Set, and its Impact on Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce parametrisation of that property of the available
  training dataset, that necessitates an inhomogeneous correlation
  structure for the function that is learnt as a model of the
  relationship between the pair of variables, observations of which
  comprise the considered training data. We refer to a parametrisation
  of this property of a given training set, as its ``inhomogeneity
  parameter''. It is easy to compute this parameter for small-to-large
  datasets, and we demonstrate such computation on multiple
  publicly-available datasets, while also demonstrating that
  conventional ``non-stationarity'' of data does not imply a non-zero
  inhomogeneity parameter of the dataset. We prove that - within the
  probabilistic Gaussian Process-based learning approach - a training
  set with a non-zero inhomogeneity parameter renders it imperative,
  that the process that is invoked to model the sought function, be
  non-stationary. Following the learning of a real-world multivariate
  function with such a Process, quality and reliability of predictions
  at test inputs, are demonstrated to be affected by the inhomogeneity
  parameter of the training data.</description>

      <title>ECG-LLM-- training and evaluation of domain-specific large language models for electrocardiography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain-adapted open-weight large language models (LLMs) offer promising healthcare applications, from queryable knowledge bases to multimodal assistants, with the crucial advantage of local deployment for privacy preservation. However, optimal adaptation strategies, evaluation methodologies, and performance relative to general-purpose LLMs remain poorly characterized. We investigated these questions in electrocardiography, an important area of cardiovascular medicine, by finetuning open-weight models on domain-specific literature and implementing a multi-layered evaluation framework comparing finetuned models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and Claude Sonnet 3.7 as a representative general-purpose model. Finetuned Llama 3.1 70B achieved superior performance on multiple-choice evaluations and automatic text metrics, ranking second to Claude 3.7 in LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Human expert evaluation favored Claude 3.7 and RAG approaches for complex queries. Finetuned models significantly outperformed their base counterparts across nearly all evaluation modes. Our findings reveal substantial performance heterogeneity across evaluation methodologies, underscoring assessment complexity. Nevertheless, domain-specific adaptation through finetuning and RAG achieves competitive performance with proprietary models, supporting the viability of privacy-preserving, locally deployable clinical solutions.</description>

Abstract: State-of-the-art perceptive Reinforcement Learning controllers for legged robots either (i) impose oscillator or IK-based gait priors that constrain the action space, add bias to the policy optimization and reduce adaptability across robot morphologies, or (ii) operate "blind", which struggle to anticipate hind-leg terrain, and are brittle to noise. In this paper, we propose Phase-Guided Terrain Traversal (PGTT), a perception-aware deep-RL approach that overcomes these limitations by enforcing gait structure purely through reward shaping, thereby reducing inductive bias in policy learning compared to oscillator/IK-conditioned action priors. PGTT encodes per-leg phase as a cubic Hermite spline that adapts swing height to local heightmap statistics and adds a swing- phase contact penalty, while the policy acts directly in joint space supporting morphology-agnostic deployment. Trained in MuJoCo (MJX) on procedurally generated stair-like terrains with curriculum and domain randomization, PGTT achieves the highest success under push disturbances (median +7.5% vs. the next best method) and on discrete obstacles (+9%), with comparable velocity tracking, and converging to an effective policy roughly 2x faster than strong end-to-end baselines. We validate PGTT on a Unitree Go2 using a real-time LiDAR elevation-to-heightmap pipeline, and we report preliminary results on ANYmal-C obtained with the same hyperparameters. These findings indicate that terrain-adaptive, phase-guided reward shaping is a simple and general mechanism for robust perceptive locomotion across platforms.</description>

      <title>S2AP: Score-space Sharpness Minimization for Adversarial Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial pruning methods have emerged as a powerful tool for compressing neural networks while preserving robustness against adversarial attacks. These methods typically follow a three-step pipeline: (i) pretrain a robust model, (ii) select a binary mask for weight pruning, and (iii) finetune the pruned model. To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by assigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with the highest scores. However, this score-space optimization can lead to sharp local minima in the robust loss landscape and, in turn, to an unstable mask selection, reducing the robustness of adversarial pruning methods. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel plug-in method for adversarial pruning, termed Score-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP). Through our method, we introduce the concept of score-space sharpness minimization, which operates during the mask search by perturbing importance scores and minimizing the corresponding robust loss. Extensive experiments across various datasets, models, and sparsity levels demonstrate that S2AP effectively minimizes sharpness in score space, stabilizing the mask selection, and ultimately improving the robustness of adversarial pruning methods.</description>

      <title>A machine learning approach to automation and uncertainty evaluation for self-validating thermocouples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermocouples are in widespread use in industry, but they are particularly susceptible to calibration drift in harsh environments. Self-validating thermocouples aim to address this issue by using a miniature phase-change cell (fixed-point) in close proximity to the measurement junction (tip) of the thermocouple. The fixed point is a crucible containing an ingot of metal with a known melting temperature. When the process temperature being monitored passes through the melting temperature of the ingot, the thermocouple output exhibits a "plateau" during melting. Since the melting temperature of the ingot is known, the thermocouple can be recalibrated in situ. Identifying the melting plateau to determine the onset of melting is reasonably well established but requires manual intervention involving zooming in on the region around the actual melting temperature, a process which can depend on the shape of the melting plateau. For the first time, we present a novel machine learning approach to recognize and identify the characteristic shape of the melting plateau and once identified, to quantity the point at which melting begins, along with its associated uncertainty. This removes the need for human intervention in locating and characterizing the melting point. Results from test data provided by CCPI Europe show 100% accuracy of melting plateau detection. They also show a cross-validated R2 of 0.99 on predictions of calibration drift.</description>

      <title>Vision Foundation Models Can Be Good Tokenizers for Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) is critically dependent on the quality of their visual tokenizer. While recent works have explored incorporating Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) via distillation, we identify a fundamental flaw in this approach: it inevitably weakens the robustness of alignment with the original VFM, causing the aligned latents to deviate semantically under distribution shifts. In this paper, we bypass distillation by proposing a more direct approach: Vision Foundation Model Variational Autoencoder (VFM-VAE). To resolve the inherent tension between the VFM's semantic focus and the need for pixel-level fidelity, we redesign the VFM-VAE decoder with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution Reconstruction blocks, enabling high-quality reconstruction from spatially coarse VFM features. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of representation dynamics during diffusion training, introducing the proposed SE-CKNNA metric as a more precise tool for this diagnosis. This analysis allows us to develop a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy that dramatically accelerates convergence. Our innovations in tokenizer design and training strategy lead to superior performance and efficiency: our system reaches a gFID (w/o CFG) of 2.20 in merely 80 epochs (a 10x speedup over prior tokenizers). With continued training to 640 epochs, it further attains a gFID (w/o CFG) of 1.62, establishing direct VFM integration as a superior paradigm for LDMs.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Vehicle Model Recognition via Text-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR) is an important task in intelligent transportation systems, but existing approaches struggle to adapt to newly released models. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) provides strong visual-text alignment, yet its fixed pretrained weights limit performance without costly image-specific finetuning. We propose a pipeline that integrates vision language models (VLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to support zero-shot recognition through text-based reasoning. A VLM converts vehicle images into descriptive attributes, which are compared against a database of textual features. Relevant entries are retrieved and combined with the description to form a prompt, and a language model (LM) infers the make and model. This design avoids large-scale retraining and enables rapid updates by adding textual descriptions of new vehicles. Experiments show that the proposed method improves recognition by nearly 20% over the CLIP baseline, demonstrating the potential of RAG-enhanced LM reasoning for scalable VMMR in smart-city applications.</description>

      <title>Decoding Dynamic Visual Experience from Calcium Imaging via Cell-Pattern-Aware SSL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) holds a great deal of promise for applications in neuroscience, due to the lack of large-scale, consistently labeled neural datasets. However, most neural datasets contain heterogeneous populations that mix stable, predictable cells with highly stochastic, stimulus-contingent ones, which has made it hard to identify consistent activity patterns during SSL. As a result, self-supervised pretraining has yet to show clear signs of benefits from scale on neural data. Here, we present a novel approach to self-supervised pretraining, POYO-SSL that exploits the heterogeneity of neural data to improve pre-training and achieve benefits of scale. Specifically, in POYO-SSL we pretrain only on predictable (statistically regular) neurons-identified on the pretraining split via simple higher-order statistics (skewness and kurtosis)-then we fine-tune on the unpredictable population for downstream tasks. On the Allen Brain Observatory dataset, this strategy yields approximately 12-13% relative gains over from-scratch training and exhibits smooth, monotonic scaling with model size. In contrast, existing state-of-the-art baselines plateau or destabilize as model size increases. By making predictability an explicit metric for crafting the data diet, POYO-SSL turns heterogeneity from a liability into an asset, providing a robust, biologically grounded recipe for scalable neural decoding and a path toward foundation models of neural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Reasoning for Steerable Pluralistic Value Alignment of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into applications serving users across diverse cultures, communities and demographics, it is critical to align LLMs with pluralistic human values beyond average principles (e.g., HHH). In psychological and social value theories such as Schwartz's Value Theory, pluralistic values are represented by multiple value dimensions paired with various priorities. However, existing methods encounter two challenges when aligning with such fine-grained value objectives: 1) they often treat multiple values as independent and equally important, ignoring their interdependence and relative priorities (value complexity); 2) they struggle to precisely control nuanced value priorities, especially those underrepresented ones (value steerability). To handle these challenges, we propose COUPLE, a COUnterfactual reasoning framework for PLuralistic valuE alignment. It introduces a structural causal model (SCM) to feature complex interdependency and prioritization among features, as well as the causal relationship between high-level value dimensions and behaviors. Moreover, it applies counterfactual reasoning to generate outputs aligned with any desired value objectives. Benefitting from explicit causal modeling, COUPLE also provides better interpretability. We evaluate COUPLE on two datasets with different value systems and demonstrate that COUPLE advances other baselines across diverse types of value objectives.</description>

      <title>Interval Prediction of Annual Average Daily Traffic on Local Roads via Quantile Random Forest with High-Dimensional Spatial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate annual average daily traffic (AADT) data are vital for transport planning and infrastructure management. However, automatic traffic detectors across national road networks often provide incomplete coverage, leading to underrepresentation of minor roads. While recent machine learning advances have improved AADT estimation at unmeasured locations, most models produce only point predictions and overlook estimation uncertainty. This study addresses that gap by introducing an interval prediction approach that explicitly quantifies predictive uncertainty. We integrate a Quantile Random Forest model with Principal Component Analysis to generate AADT prediction intervals, providing plausible traffic ranges bounded by estimated minima and maxima. Using data from over 2,000 minor roads in England and Wales, and evaluated with specialized interval metrics, the proposed method achieves an interval coverage probability of 88.22%, a normalized average width of 0.23, and a Winkler Score of 7,468.47. By combining machine learning with spatial and high-dimensional analysis, this framework enhances both the accuracy and interpretability of AADT estimation, supporting more robust and informed transport planning.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Evidence Framework Rescues Low- Power Prognostic Signals and Rejects Statistical Artifacts in Cancer Genomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation: Standard genome-wide association studies in cancer genomics rely on statistical significance with multiple testing correction, but systematically fail in underpowered cohorts. In TCGA breast cancer (n=967, 133 deaths), low event rates (13.8%) create severe power limitations, producing false negatives for known drivers and false positives for large passenger genes. Results: We developed a five-criteria computational framework integrating causal inference (inverse probability weighting, doubly robust estimation) with orthogonal biological validation (expression, mutation patterns, literature evidence). Applied to TCGA-BRCA mortality analysis, standard Cox+FDR detected zero genes at FDR&lt;0.05, confirming complete failure in underpowered settings. Our framework correctly identified RYR2 - a cardiac gene with no cancer function - as a false positive despite nominal significance (p=0.024), while identifying KMT2C as a complex candidate requiring validation despite marginal significance (p=0.047, q=0.954). Power analysis revealed median power of 15.1% across genes, with KMT2C achieving only 29.8% power (HR=1.55), explaining borderline statistical significance despite strong biological evidence. The framework distinguished true signals from artifacts through mutation pattern analysis: RYR2 showed 29.8% silent mutations (passenger signature) with no hotspots, while KMT2C showed 6.7% silent mutations with 31.4% truncating variants (driver signature). This multi-evidence approach provides a template for analyzing underpowered cohorts, prioritizing biological interpretability over purely statistical significance.

      <title>CovMatch: Cross-Covariance Guided Multimodal Dataset Distillation with Trainable Text Encoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small set of image-text pairs that enables efficient training of large-scale vision-language models. While dataset distillation has shown promise in unimodal tasks, extending it to multimodal contrastive learning presents key challenges: learning cross-modal alignment and managing the high computational cost of large encoders. Prior approaches address scalability by freezing the text encoder and update only the image encoder and text projection layer. However, we find this severely limits semantic alignment and becomes a bottleneck for performance scaling. We propose CovMatch, a scalable dataset distillation framework that aligns the cross-covariance of real and synthetic features while regularizing feature distributions within each modality. Unlike prior approaches, CovMatch enables joint optimization of both encoders, leading to stronger cross-modal alignment and improved performance. Evaluated on Flickr30K and COCO, CovMatch outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal distillation methods and achieves up to 6.8% absolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic pairs.</description>

      <title>Channel-Aware Vector Quantization for Robust Semantic Communication on Discrete Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based semantic communication has largely relied on analog or semi-digital transmission, which limits compatibility with modern digital communication infrastructures. Recent studies have employed vector quantization (VQ) to enable discrete semantic transmission, yet existing methods neglect channel state information during codebook optimization, leading to suboptimal robustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a channel-aware vector quantization (CAVQ) algorithm within a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework, termed VQJSCC, established on a discrete memoryless channel. In this framework, semantic features are discretized and directly mapped to modulation constellation symbols, while CAVQ integrates channel transition probabilities into the quantization process, aligning easily confused symbols with semantically similar codewords. A multi-codebook alignment mechanism is further introduced to handle mismatches between codebook order and modulation order by decomposing the transmission stream into multiple independently optimized subchannels. Experimental results demonstrate that VQJSCC effectively mitigates the digital cliff effect, achieves superior reconstruction quality across various modulation schemes, and outperforms state-of-the-art digital semantic communication baselines in both robustness and efficiency.</description>

Abstract: The birth of Foundation Models brought unprecedented results in a wide range of tasks, from language to vision, to robotic control. These models are able to process huge quantities of data, and can extract and develop rich representations, which can be employed across different domains and modalities. However, they still have issues in adapting to dynamic, real-world scenarios without retraining the entire model from scratch. In this work, we propose the application of Continual Learning and Compositionality principles to foster the development of more flexible, efficient and smart AI solutions.</description>

      <title>C-SWAP: Explainability-Aware Structured Pruning for Efficient Neural Networks Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years, particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights, neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization. To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>{\epsilon}-Seg: Sparsely Supervised Semantic Segmentation of Microscopy Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of electron microscopy (EM) images of biological samples remains a challenge in the life sciences. EM data captures details of biological structures, sometimes with such complexity that even human observers can find it overwhelming. We introduce {\epsilon}-Seg, a method based on hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), employing center-region masking, sparse label contrastive learning (CL), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior, and clustering-free label prediction. Center-region masking and the inpainting loss encourage the model to learn robust and representative embeddings to distinguish the desired classes, even if training labels are sparse (0.05% of the total image data or less). For optimal performance, we employ CL and a GMM prior to shape the latent space of the HVAE such that encoded input patches tend to cluster wrt. the semantic classes we wish to distinguish. Finally, instead of clustering latent embeddings for semantic segmentation, we propose a MLP semantic segmentation head to directly predict class labels from latent embeddings. We show empirical results of {\epsilon}-Seg and baseline methods on 2 dense EM datasets of biological tissues and demonstrate the applicability of our method also on fluorescence microscopy data. Our results show that {\epsilon}-Seg is capable of achieving competitive sparsely-supervised segmentation results on complex biological image data, even if only limited amounts of training labels are available.</description>

      <title>Binary Quadratic Quantization: Beyond First-Order Quantization for Real-Valued Matrix Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel matrix quantization method, Binary Quadratic Quantization (BQQ). In contrast to conventional first-order quantization approaches, such as uniform quantization and binary coding quantization, that approximate real-valued matrices via linear combinations of binary bases, BQQ leverages the expressive power of binary quadratic expressions while maintaining an extremely compact data format. We validate our approach with two experiments: a matrix compression benchmark and post-training quantization (PTQ) on pretrained Vision Transformer-based models. Experimental results demonstrate that BQQ consistently achieves a superior trade-off between memory efficiency and reconstruction error than conventional methods for compressing diverse matrix data. It also delivers strong PTQ performance, even though we neither target state-of-the-art PTQ accuracy under tight memory constraints nor rely on PTQ-specific binary matrix optimization. For example, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art PTQ method by up to 2.2\% and 59.1% on the ImageNet dataset under the calibration-based and data-free scenarios, respectively, with quantization equivalent to 2 bits. These findings highlight the surprising effectiveness of binary quadratic expressions for efficient matrix approximation and neural network compression.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private E-Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: E-values have gained prominence as flexible tools for statistical inference and risk control, enabling anytime- and post-hoc-valid procedures under minimal assumptions. However, many real-world applications fundamentally rely on sensitive data, which can be leaked through e-values. To ensure their safe release, we propose a general framework to transform non-private e-values into differentially private ones. Towards this end, we develop a novel biased multiplicative noise mechanism that ensures our e-values remain statistically valid. We show that our differentially private e-values attain strong statistical power, and are asymptotically as powerful as their non-private counterparts. Experiments across online risk monitoring, private healthcare, and conformal e-prediction demonstrate our approach's effectiveness and illustrate its broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Low-Rank Factorization for Robust Model Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large speech foundation models achieve strong performance across many domains, but they often require adaptation to handle local needs such as code-switching, where speakers mix languages within the same utterance. Direct fine-tuning of these models risks overfitting to the target domain and overwriting the broad capabilities of the base model. To address this challenge, we explore Bayesian factorized adapters for speech foundation models, which place priors near zero to achieve sparser adaptation matrices and thereby retain general performance while adapting to specific domains. We apply our approach to the Whisper model and evaluate on different multilingual code-switching scenarios. Our results show only minimal adaptation loss while significantly reducing catastrophic forgetting of the base model. Compared to LoRA, our method achieves a backward gain of 54% with only a 4% drop on the new domain. These findings highlight the effectiveness of Bayesian adaptation for fine-tuning speech foundation models without sacrificing generalization.</description>

      <title>Adapting Language Balance in Code-Switching Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite achieving impressive results on standard benchmarks, large foundational models still struggle against code-switching test cases. When data scarcity cannot be used as the usual justification for poor performance, the reason may lie in the infrequent occurrence of code-switched moments, where the embedding of the second language appears subtly. Instead of expecting the models to learn this infrequency on their own, it might be beneficial to provide the training process with labels. Evaluating model performance on code-switching data requires careful localization of code-switching points where recognition errors are most consequential, so that the analysis emphasizes mistakes occurring at those moments. Building on this observation, we leverage the difference between the embedded and the main language to highlight those code-switching points and thereby emphasize learning at those locations. This simple yet effective differentiable surrogate mitigates context bias during generation -- the central challenge in code-switching -- thereby improving the model's robustness. Our experiments with Arabic and Chinese-English showed that the models are able to predict the switching places more correctly, reflected by the reduced substitution error.</description>

      <title>Verifiable Accuracy and Abstention Rewards in Curriculum RL to Alleviate Lost-in-Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate strong capabilities in single-turn instruction following but suffer from Lost-in-Conversation (LiC), a degradation in performance as information is revealed progressively in multi-turn settings. Motivated by the current progress on Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), we propose Curriculum Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Accuracy and Abstention Rewards (RLAAR), a framework that encourages models not only to generate correct answers, but also to judge the solvability of questions in the multi-turn conversation setting. Our approach employs a competence-gated curriculum that incrementally increases dialogue difficulty (in terms of instruction shards), stabilizing training while promoting reliability. Using multi-turn, on-policy rollouts and a mixed-reward system, RLAAR teaches models to balance problem-solving with informed abstention, reducing premature answering behaviors that cause LiC. Evaluated on LiC benchmarks, RLAAR significantly mitigates LiC performance decay (62.6% to 75.1%) and improves calibrated abstention rates (33.5% to 73.4%). Together, these results provide a practical recipe for building multi-turn reliable and trustworthy LLMs.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Buffer for Online Generative Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online Speech Enhancement was mainly reserved for predictive models. A key advantage of these models is that for an incoming signal frame from a stream of data, the model is called only once for enhancement. In contrast, generative Speech Enhancement models often require multiple calls, resulting in a computational complexity that is too high for many online speech enhancement applications. This work presents the Diffusion Buffer, a generative diffusion-based Speech Enhancement model which only requires one neural network call per incoming signal frame from a stream of data and performs enhancement in an online fashion on a consumer-grade GPU. The key idea of the Diffusion Buffer is to align physical time with Diffusion time-steps. The approach progressively denoises frames through physical time, where past frames have more noise removed. Consequently, an enhanced frame is output to the listener with a delay defined by the Diffusion Buffer, and the output frame has a corresponding look-ahead. In this work, we extend upon our previous work by carefully designing a 2D convolutional UNet architecture that specifically aligns with the Diffusion Buffer's look-ahead. We observe that the proposed UNet improves performance, particularly when the algorithmic latency is low. Moreover, we show that using a Data Prediction loss instead of Denoising Score Matching loss enables flexible control over the trade-off between algorithmic latency and quality during inference. The extended Diffusion Buffer equipped with a novel NN and loss function drastically reduces the algorithmic latency from 320 - 960 ms to 32 - 176 ms with an even increased performance. While it has been shown before that offline generative diffusion models outperform predictive approaches in unseen noisy speech data, we confirm that the online Diffusion Buffer also outperforms its predictive counterpart on unseen noisy speech data.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Emulators for Cosmology: Accelerating Cosmological Analyses Without Sacrificing Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cosmology, emulators play a crucial role by providing fast and accurate predictions of complex physical models, enabling efficient exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces that would be computationally prohibitive with direct numerical simulations. Symbolic emulators have emerged as promising alternatives to numerical approaches, delivering comparable accuracy with significantly faster evaluation times. While previous symbolic emulators were limited to relatively narrow prior ranges, we expand these to cover the parameter space relevant for current cosmological analyses. We introduce approximations to hypergeometric functions used for the $\Lambda$CDM comoving distance and linear growth factor which are accurate to better than 0.001% and 0.05%, respectively, for all redshifts and for $\Omega_{\rm m} \in [0.1, 0.5]$. We show that integrating symbolic emulators into a Dark Energy Survey-like $3\times2$pt analysis produces cosmological constraints consistent with those obtained using standard numerical methods. Our symbolic emulators offer substantial improvements in speed and memory usage, demonstrating their practical potential for scalable, likelihood-based inference.</description>

      <title>A Frequentist Statistical Introduction to Variational Inference, Autoencoders, and Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Variational Inference (VI) is central to modern generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), its pedagogical treatment is split across disciplines. In statistics, VI is typically framed as a Bayesian method for posterior approximation. In machine learning, however, VAEs and DDMs are developed from a Frequentist viewpoint, where VI is used to approximate a maximum likelihood estimator. This creates a barrier for statisticians, as the principles behind VAEs and DDMs are hard to contextualize without a corresponding Frequentist introduction to VI. This paper provides that introduction: we explain the theory for VI, VAEs, and DDMs from a purely Frequentist perspective, starting with the classical Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We show how VI arises as a scalable solution for intractable E-steps and how VAEs and DDMs are natural, deep-learning-based extensions of this framework, thereby bridging the gap between classical statistical inference and modern generative AI.</description>

      <title>Decoding Funded Research: Comparative Analysis of Topic Models and Uncovering the Effect of Gender and Geographic Location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing national scientific investment requires a clear understanding of evolving research trends and the demographic and geographical forces shaping them, particularly in light of commitments to equity, diversity, and inclusion. This study addresses this need by analyzing 18 years (2005-2022) of research proposals funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). We conducted a comprehensive comparative evaluation of three topic modelling approaches: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Structural Topic Modelling (STM), and BERTopic. We also introduced a novel algorithm, named COFFEE, designed to enable robust covariate effect estimation for BERTopic. This advancement addresses a significant gap, as BERTopic lacks a native function for covariate analysis, unlike the probabilistic STM. Our findings highlight that while all models effectively delineate core scientific domains, BERTopic outperformed by consistently identifying more granular, coherent, and emergent themes, such as the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence. Additionally, the covariate analysis, powered by COFFEE, confirmed distinct provincial research specializations and revealed consistent gender-based thematic patterns across various scientific disciplines. These insights offer a robust empirical foundation for funding organizations to formulate more equitable and impactful funding strategies, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the scientific ecosystem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a fundamental technique for dimensionality reduction and denoising; however, its application to three-dimensional data with arbitrary orientations -- common in structural biology -- presents significant challenges. A naive approach requires augmenting the dataset with many rotated copies of each sample, incurring prohibitive computational costs. In this paper, we extend PCA to 3D volumetric datasets with unknown orientations by developing an efficient and principled framework for SO(3)-invariant PCA that implicitly accounts for all rotations without explicit data augmentation. By exploiting underlying algebraic structure, we demonstrate that the computation involves only the square root of the total number of covariance entries, resulting in a substantial reduction in complexity. We validate the method on real-world molecular datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and opening up new possibilities for large-scale, high-dimensional reconstruction problems.</description>

      <title>MTraining: Distributed Dynamic Sparse Attention for Efficient Ultra-Long Context Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adoption of long context windows has become a standard feature in Large Language Models (LLMs), as extended contexts significantly enhance their capacity for complex reasoning and broaden their applicability across diverse scenarios. Dynamic sparse attention is a promising approach for reducing the computational cost of long-context. However, efficiently training LLMs with dynamic sparse attention on ultra-long contexts-especially in distributed settings-remains a significant challenge, due in large part to worker- and step-level imbalance. This paper introduces MTraining, a novel distributed methodology leveraging dynamic sparse attention to enable efficient training for LLMs with ultra-long contexts. Specifically, MTraining integrates three key components: a dynamic sparse training pattern, balanced sparse ring attention, and hierarchical sparse ring attention. These components are designed to synergistically address the computational imbalance and communication overheads inherent in dynamic sparse attention mechanisms during the training of models with extensive context lengths. We demonstrate the efficacy of MTraining by training Qwen2.5-3B, successfully expanding its context window from 32K to 512K tokens on a cluster of 32 A100 GPUs. Our evaluations on a comprehensive suite of downstream tasks, including RULER, PG-19, InfiniteBench, and Needle In A Haystack, reveal that MTraining achieves up to a 6x higher training throughput while preserving model accuracy.

      <title>Lyapunov-Aware Quantum-Inspired Reinforcement Learning for Continuous-Time Vehicle Control: A Feasibility Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Lyapunov-Based Quantum Reinforcement Learning (LQRL) framework that integrates quantum policy optimization with Lyapunov stability analysis for continuous-time vehicle control. The proposed approach combines the representational power of variational quantum circuits (VQCs) with a stability-aware policy gradient mechanism to ensure asymptotic convergence and safe decision-making under dynamic environments. The vehicle longitudinal control problem was formulated as a continuous-state reinforcement learning task, where the quantum policy network generates control actions subject to Lyapunov stability constraints. Simulation experiments were conducted in a closed-loop adaptive cruise control scenario using a quantum-inspired policy trained under stability feedback. The results demonstrate that the LQRL framework successfully embeds Lyapunov stability verification into quantum policy learning, enabling interpretable and stability-aware control performance. Although transient overshoot and Lyapunov divergence were observed under aggressive acceleration, the system maintained bounded state evolution, validating the feasibility of integrating safety guarantees within quantum reinforcement learning architectures. The proposed framework provides a foundational step toward provably safe quantum control in autonomous systems and hybrid quantum-classical optimization domains.</description>

      <title>LightMem: Lightweight and Efficient Memory-Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic and complex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless interactions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and utilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce substantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new memory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance and efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of human memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First, cognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information through lightweight compression and groups information according to their topics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based groups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally, long-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that decouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with GPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in accuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API calls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x. The code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/LightMem.</description>

Abstract: While large machine learning models have shown remarkable performance in various domains, their training typically requires iterating for many passes over the training data. However, due to computational and memory constraints and potential privacy concerns, storing and accessing all the data is impractical in many real-world scenarios where the data arrives in a stream. In this paper, we investigate the problem of one-pass learning, in which a model is trained on sequentially arriving data without retraining on previous datapoints. Motivated by the demonstrated effectiveness of overparameterized models and the phenomenon of benign overfitting, we propose Orthogonal Recursive Fitting (ORFit), an algorithm for one-pass learning which seeks to perfectly fit each new datapoint while minimally altering the predictions on previous datapoints. ORFit updates the parameters in a direction orthogonal to past gradients, similar to orthogonal gradient descent (OGD) in continual learning. We show that, interestingly, ORFit's update leads to an operation similar to the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm in adaptive filtering but with significantly improved memory and computational efficiency, i.e., linear, instead of quadratic, in the number of parameters. To further reduce memory usage, we leverage the structure of the streaming data via an incremental principal component analysis (IPCA). We show that using the principal components is minimax optimal, i.e., it minimizes the worst-case forgetting of previous predictions for unknown future updates. Further, we prove that, for overparameterized linear models, the parameter vector obtained by ORFit matches what the standard multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) would converge to. Finally, we extend our results to the nonlinear setting for highly overparameterized models, relevant for deep learning.</description>

      <title>Better NTK Conditioning: A Free Lunch from (ReLU) Nonlinear Activation in Wide Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear activation functions are widely recognized for enhancing the expressivity of neural networks, which is the primary reason for their widespread implementation. In this work, we focus on ReLU activation and reveal a novel and intriguing property of nonlinear activations. By comparing enabling and disabling the nonlinear activations in the neural network, we demonstrate their specific effects on wide neural networks: (a) better feature separation, i.e., a larger angle separation for similar data in the feature space of model gradient, and (b) better NTK conditioning, i.e., a smaller condition number of neural tangent kernel (NTK). Furthermore, we show that the network depth (i.e., with more nonlinear activation operations) further amplifies these effects; in addition, in the infinite-width-then-depth limit, all data are equally separated with a fixed angle in the model gradient feature space, regardless of how similar they are originally in the input space. Note that, without the nonlinear activation, i.e., in a linear neural network, the data separation remains the same as for the original inputs and NTK condition number is equivalent to the Gram matrix, regardless of the network depth. Due to the close connection between NTK condition number and convergence theories, our results imply that nonlinear activation helps to improve the worst-case convergence rates of gradient based methods.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Prior Errors in Causal Structure Learning: A Resilient Approach via Bayesian Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal structure learning (CSL), a prominent technique for encoding cause-and-effect relationships among variables, through Bayesian Networks (BNs). Although recovering causal structure solely from data is a challenge, the integration of prior knowledge, revealing partial structural truth, can markedly enhance learning quality. However, current methods based on prior knowledge exhibit limited resilience to errors in the prior, with hard constraint methods disregarding priors entirely, and soft constraints accepting priors based on a predetermined confidence level, which may require expert intervention. To address this issue, we propose a strategy resilient to edge-level prior errors for CSL, thereby minimizing human intervention. We classify prior errors into different types and provide their theoretical impact on the Structural Hamming Distance (SHD) under the presumption of sufficient data. Intriguingly, we discover and prove that the strong hazard of prior errors is associated with a unique acyclic closed structure, defined as ``quasi-circle''. Leveraging this insight, a post-hoc strategy is employed to identify the prior errors by its impact on the increment of ``quasi-circles''. Through empirical evaluation on both real and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate our strategy's robustness against prior errors. Specifically, we highlight its substantial ability to resist order-reversed errors while maintaining the majority of correct prior.</description>

      <title>Estimating Model Performance Under Covariate Shift Without Labels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08348v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After deployment, machine learning models often experience performance degradation due to shifts in data distribution. It is challenging to assess post-deployment performance accurately when labels are missing or delayed. Existing proxy methods, such as data drift detection, fail to measure the effects of these shifts adequately. To address this, we introduce a new method for evaluating binary classification models on unlabeled tabular data that accurately estimates model performance under covariate shift and call it Probabilistic Adaptive Performance Estimation (PAPE). It can be applied to any performance metric defined with elements of the confusion matrix. Crucially, PAPE operates independently of the original model, relying only on its predictions and probability estimates, and does not need any assumptions about the nature of covariate shift, learning directly from data instead. We tested PAPE using over 900 dataset-model combinations from US census data, assessing its performance against several benchmarks through various metrics. Our findings show that PAPE outperforms other methodologies, making it a superior choice for estimating the performance of binary classification models.</description>

      <title>Sparse Explanations of Neural Networks Using Pruned Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explainability is a key component in many applications involving deep neural networks (DNNs). However, current explanation methods for DNNs commonly leave it to the human observer to distinguish relevant explanations from spurious noise. This is not feasible anymore when going from easily human-accessible data such as images to more complex data such as genome sequences. To facilitate the accessibility of DNN outputs from such complex data and to increase explainability, we present a modification of the widely used explanation method layer-wise relevance propagation. Our approach enforces sparsity directly by pruning the relevance propagation for the different layers. Thereby, we achieve sparser relevance attributions for the input features as well as for the intermediate layers. As the relevance propagation is input-specific, we aim to prune the relevance propagation rather than the underlying model architecture. This allows to prune different neurons for different inputs and hence, might be more appropriate to the local nature of explanation methods. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we evaluate it on two types of data: images and genome sequences. We show that our modification indeed leads to noise reduction and concentrates relevance on the most important features compared to the baseline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mitigating bias in automated decision-making systems, particularly in deep learning models, is a critical challenge due to nuanced definitions of fairness, dataset-specific biases, and the inherent trade-off between fairness and accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce FairVIC, an innovative approach that enhances fairness in neural networks by integrating variance, invariance, and covariance terms into the loss function during training. Unlike methods that rely on predefined fairness criteria, FairVIC abstracts fairness concepts to minimise dependency on protected characteristics. We evaluate FairVIC against comparable bias mitigation techniques on benchmark datasets, considering both group and individual fairness, and conduct an ablation study on the accuracy-fairness trade-off. FairVIC demonstrates significant improvements ($\approx70\%$) in fairness across all tested metrics without compromising accuracy, thus offering a robust, generalisable solution for fair deep learning across diverse tasks and datasets.</description>

Abstract: Residential Load Profile (RLP) generation and prediction are critical for the operation and planning of distribution networks, especially as diverse low-carbon technologies (e.g., photovoltaic and electric vehicles) are increasingly adopted. This paper introduces a novel flow-based generative model, termed Full Convolutional Profile Flow (FCPFlow), which is uniquely designed for both conditional and unconditional RLP generation, and for probabilistic load forecasting. By introducing two new layers--the invertible linear layer and the invertible normalization layer--the proposed FCPFlow architecture shows three main advantages compared to traditional statistical and contemporary deep generative models: 1) it is well-suited for RLP generation under continuous conditions, such as varying weather and annual electricity consumption, 2) it demonstrates superior scalability in different datasets compared to traditional statistical models, and 3) it also demonstrates better modeling capabilities in capturing the complex correlation of RLPs compared with deep generative models.</description>

      <title>Learning Confidence Bounds for Classification with Imbalanced Data</title>

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a significant challenge in classification tasks, where traditional approaches often lead to biased models and unreliable predictions. Undersampling and oversampling techniques have been commonly employed to address this issue, yet they suffer from inherent limitations stemming from their simplistic approach such as loss of information and additional biases respectively. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages learning theory and concentration inequalities to overcome the shortcomings of traditional solutions. We focus on understanding the uncertainty in a class-dependent manner, as captured by confidence bounds that we directly embed into the learning process. By incorporating class-dependent estimates, our method can effectively adapt to the varying degrees of imbalance across different classes, resulting in more robust and reliable classification outcomes. We empirically show how our framework provides a promising direction for handling imbalanced data in classification tasks, offering practitioners a valuable tool for building more accurate and trustworthy models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalization beyond training data remains a central challenge in machine learning for biology. A common way to enhance generalization is self-supervised pre-training on large datasets. However, aiming to perform well on all possible proteins can limit a model's capacity to excel on any specific one, whereas experimentalists typically need accurate predictions for individual proteins they study, often not covered in training data. To address this limitation, we propose a method that enables self-supervised customization of protein language models to one target protein at a time, on the fly, and without assuming any additional data. We show that our Protein Test-Time Training (ProteinTTT) method consistently enhances generalization across different models, their sizes, and datasets. ProteinTTT improves structure prediction for challenging targets, achieves new state-of-the-art results on protein fitness prediction, and enhances function prediction on two tasks. Through two challenging case studies, we also show that customization via ProteinTTT achieves more accurate antibody-antigen loop modeling and enhances 19% of structures in the Big Fantastic Virus Database, delivering improved predictions where general-purpose AlphaFold2 and ESMFold struggle.</description>

      <title>FedMeld: A Model-dispersal Federated Learning Framework for Space-ground Integrated Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To bridge the digital divide, the space-ground integrated networks (SGINs), which will be a key component of the six-generation (6G) mobile networks, are expected to deliver artificial intelligence (AI) services to every corner of the world. One mission of SGINs is to support federated learning (FL) at a global scale. However, existing space-ground integrated FL frameworks involve ground stations or costly inter-satellite links, entailing excessive training latency and communication costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose an infrastructure-free federated learning framework based on a model dispersal (FedMeld) strategy, which exploits periodic movement patterns and store-carry-forward capabilities of satellites to enable parameter mixing across large-scale geographical regions. We theoretically show that FedMeld leads to global model convergence and quantify the effects of round interval and mixing ratio between adjacent areas on its learning performance. Based on the theoretical results, we formulate a joint optimization problem to design the staleness control and mixing ratio (SC-MR) for minimizing the training loss. By decomposing the problem into sequential SC and MR subproblems without compromising the optimality, we derive the round interval solution in a closed form and the mixing ratio in a semi-closed form to achieve the optimal latency-accuracy tradeoff. Experiments using various datasets demonstrate that FedMeld achieves superior model accuracy while significantly reducing communication costs as compared with traditional FL schemes for SGINs.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Federated Learning: A Scalable Approach for Decentralized Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17723v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for decentralized machine learning, enabling collaborative model training across diverse clients without sharing raw data. However, traditional FL approaches often face limitations in scalability and efficiency due to their reliance on synchronous client updates, which can result in significant delays and increased communication overhead, particularly in heterogeneous and dynamic environments. To address these challenges in this paper, we propose an Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) algorithm, which allows clients to update the global model independently and asynchronously. Our key contributions include a comprehensive convergence analysis of AFL in the presence of client delays and model staleness. By leveraging martingale difference sequence theory and variance bounds, we ensure robust convergence despite asynchronous updates. Assuming strongly convex local objective functions, we establish bounds on gradient variance under random client sampling and derive a recursion formula quantifying the impact of client delays on convergence. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical applicability of the AFL algorithm by training decentralized linear regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifiers and compare its results with synchronous FL algorithm to effectively handling non-IID data distributed among clients. The proposed AFL algorithm addresses key limitations of traditional FL methods, such as inefficiency due to global synchronization and susceptibility to client drift. It enhances scalability, robustness, and efficiency in real-world settings with heterogeneous client populations and dynamic network conditions. Our results underscore the potential of AFL to drive advancements indistributed learning systems, particularly for large-scale, privacy-preserving applications in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-modal generative AI systems, such as those combining vision and language, rely on contrastive pre-training to learn representations across different modalities. While their practical benefits are widely acknowledged, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the contrastive pre-training framework remains limited. This paper develops a theoretical framework to explain the success of contrastive pre-training in downstream tasks, such as zero-shot classification, conditional diffusion models, and vision-language models. We introduce the concept of approximate sufficient statistics, a generalization of the classical sufficient statistics, and show that near-minimizers of the contrastive pre-training loss are approximately sufficient, making them adaptable to diverse downstream tasks. We further propose the Joint Generative Hierarchical Model for the joint distribution of images and text, showing that transformers can efficiently approximate relevant functions within this model via belief propagation. Building on this framework, we derive sample complexity guarantees for multi-modal learning based on contrastive pre-trained representations. Numerical simulations validate these theoretical findings, demonstrating the strong generalization performance of contrastively pre-trained transformers in various multi-modal tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework showing that popular LLM alignment methods, including RLHF and its variants, can be understood as divergence estimators between aligned (safe or preferred) and unaligned (harmful or less preferred) distributions. This perspective explains the emergence of separation in the latent space between safe and harmful prompts after alignment. As an application of our general divergence framework, we propose KLDO, a novel KL divergence-based alignment method, and empirically validate its effectiveness. We further show that using compliance-refusal datasets, rather than standard preference-based datasets, leads to stronger separation and improved safety alignment. Finally, to quantify the separation effect, we propose a distance-based metric in the prompt representation space, which also acts as a statistically significant indicator for model safety.</description>

      <title>Can We Validate Counterfactual Estimations in the Presence of General Network Interference?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized experiments have become a cornerstone of evidence-based decision-making in contexts ranging from online platforms to public health. However, in experimental settings with network interference, a unit's treatment can influence outcomes of other units, challenging both causal effect estimation and its validation. Classic validation approaches fail as outcomes are only observable under a single treatment scenario and exhibit complex correlation patterns due to interference. To address these challenges, we introduce a framework that facilitates the use of machine learning tools for both estimation and validation in causal inference. Central to our approach is the new distribution-preserving network bootstrap, a theoretically-grounded technique that generates multiple statistically-valid subpopulations from a single experiment's data. This amplification of experimental samples enables our second contribution: a counterfactual cross-validation procedure. This procedure adapts the principles of model validation to the unique constraints of causal settings, providing a rigorous, data-driven method for selecting and evaluating estimators. We extend recent causal message-passing developments by incorporating heterogeneous unit-level characteristics and varying local interactions, ensuring reliable finite-sample performance through non-asymptotic analysis. Additionally, we develop and publicly release a comprehensive benchmark toolbox featuring diverse experimental environments, from networks of interacting AI agents to ride-sharing applications. These environments provide known ground truth values while maintaining realistic complexities, enabling systematic evaluation of causal inference methods. Extensive testing across these environments demonstrates our method's robustness to diverse forms of network interference.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Similarity Metrics for Data Selection for Language Model Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring similarity between training examples is critical for curating high-quality and diverse pretraining datasets for language models. However, similarity is typically computed with a generic off-the-shelf embedding model that has been trained for tasks such as retrieval. Whether these embedding-based similarity metrics are well-suited for pretraining data selection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a new framework to assess the suitability of a similarity metric specifically for data curation in language model pretraining applications. Our framework's first evaluation criterion captures how well distances reflect generalization in pretraining loss between different training examples. Next, we use each embedding model to guide a standard diversity-based data curation algorithm and measure its utility by pretraining a language model on the selected data and evaluating downstream task performance. Finally, we evaluate the capabilities of embeddings to distinguish between examples from different data sources. With these evaluations, we demonstrate that standard off-the-shelf embedding models are not well-suited for the pretraining data curation setting, underperforming even remarkably simple embeddings that are extracted from models trained on the same pretraining corpus. Our experiments are performed on the Pile, for pretraining a 1.7B parameter language model on 200B tokens. We believe our analysis and evaluation framework serves as a foundation for the future design of embeddings that specifically reason about similarity in pretraining datasets.</description>

      <title>Beyond Benign Overfitting in Nadaraya-Watson Interpolators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been much interest in understanding the generalization behavior of interpolating predictors, which overfit on noisy training data. Whereas standard analyses are concerned with whether a method is consistent or not, recent observations have shown that even inconsistent predictors can generalize well. In this work, we revisit the classic interpolating Nadaraya-Watson (NW) estimator (also known as Shepard's method), and study its generalization capabilities through this modern viewpoint. In particular, by varying a single bandwidth-like hyperparameter, we prove the existence of multiple overfitting behaviors, ranging non-monotonically from catastrophic, through benign, to tempered. Our results highlight how even classical interpolating methods can exhibit intricate generalization behaviors. In addition, for the purpose of tuning the hyperparameter, the results suggest that over-estimating the intrinsic dimension of the data is less harmful than under-estimating it. Numerical experiments complement our theory, demonstrating the same phenomena.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning of Linear Dynamical Systems with Transformers: Approximation Bounds and Depth-Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates approximation-theoretic aspects of the in-context learning capability of the transformers in representing a family of noisy linear dynamical systems. Our first theoretical result establishes an upper bound on the approximation error of multi-layer transformers with respect to an $L^2$-testing loss uniformly defined across tasks. This result demonstrates that transformers with logarithmic depth can achieve error bounds comparable with those of the least-squares estimator. In contrast, our second result establishes a non-diminishing lower bound on the approximation error for a class of single-layer linear transformers, which suggests a depth-separation phenomenon for transformers in the in-context learning of dynamical systems. Moreover, this second result uncovers a critical distinction in the approximation power of single-layer linear transformers when learning from IID versus non-IID data.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Sample Selection Against Label Noise by Cutting Mislabeled Easy Examples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sample selection is a prevalent approach in learning with noisy labels, aiming to identify confident samples for training. Although existing sample selection methods have achieved decent results by reducing the noise rate of the selected subset, they often overlook that not all mislabeled examples harm the model's performance equally. In this paper, we demonstrate that mislabeled examples correctly predicted by the model early in the training process are particularly harmful to model performance. We refer to these examples as Mislabeled Easy Examples (MEEs). To address this, we propose Early Cutting, which introduces a recalibration step that employs the model's later training state to re-select the confident subset identified early in training, thereby avoiding misleading confidence from early learning and effectively filtering out MEEs. Experiments on the CIFAR, WebVision, and full ImageNet-1k datasets demonstrate that our method effectively improves sample selection and model performance by reducing MEEs.</description>

      <title>CayleyPy RL: Pathfinding and Reinforcement Learning on Cayley Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series of studies on developing efficient artificial intelligence-based approaches to pathfinding on extremely large graphs (e.g. $10^{70}$ nodes) with a focus on Cayley graphs and mathematical applications. The open-source CayleyPy project is a central component of our research. The present paper proposes a novel combination of a reinforcement learning approach with a more direct diffusion distance approach from the first paper. Our analysis includes benchmarking various choices for the key building blocks of the approach: architectures of the neural network, generators for the random walks and beam search pathfinding. We compared these methods against the classical computer algebra system GAP, demonstrating that they "overcome the GAP" for the considered examples. As a particular mathematical application we examine the Cayley graph of the symmetric group with cyclic shift and transposition generators. We provide strong support for the OEIS-A186783 conjecture that the diameter is equal to n(n-1)/2 by machine learning and mathematical methods. We identify the conjectured longest element and generate its decomposition of the desired length. We prove a diameter lower bound of n(n-1)/2-n/2 and an upper bound of n(n-1)/2+ 3n by presenting the algorithm with given complexity. We also present several conjectures motivated by numerical experiments, including observations on the central limit phenomenon (with growth approximated by a Gumbel distribution), the uniform distribution for the spectrum of the graph, and a numerical study of sorting networks. To stimulate crowdsourcing activity, we create challenges on the Kaggle platform and invite contributions to improve and benchmark approaches on Cayley graph pathfinding and other tasks.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning of Stochastic Differential Equations with Foundation Inference Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) describe dynamical systems where deterministic flows, governed by a drift function, are superimposed with random fluctuations, dictated by a diffusion function. The accurate estimation (or discovery) of these functions from data is a central problem in machine learning, with wide application across the natural and social sciences. Yet current solutions either rely heavily on prior knowledge of the dynamics or involve intricate training procedures. We introduce FIM-SDE (Foundation Inference Model for SDEs), a pretrained recognition model that delivers accurate in-context (or zero-shot) estimation of the drift and diffusion functions of low-dimensional SDEs, from noisy time series data, and allows rapid finetuning to target datasets. Leveraging concepts from amortized inference and neural operators, we (pre)train FIM-SDE in a supervised fashion to map a large set of noisy, discretely observed SDE paths onto the space of drift and diffusion functions. We demonstrate that FIM-SDE achieves robust in-context function estimation across a wide range of synthetic and real-world processes -- from canonical SDE systems (e.g., double-well dynamics or weakly perturbed Lorenz attractors) to stock price recordings and oil-price and wind-speed fluctuations -- while matching the performance of symbolic, Gaussian process and Neural SDE baselines trained on the target datasets. When finetuned to the target processes, we show that FIM-SDE consistently outperforms all these baselines.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards: GRPO's Effective Loss, Dynamics, and Success Amplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06639v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was introduced and used recently for promoting reasoning in LLMs under verifiable (binary) rewards. We show that the mean + variance calibration of these rewards induces a weighted contrastive loss in which the contrastive samples are synthetic data drawn from the previous policy. While GRPO was originally paired with clipping to keep updates near the old policy, we analyze variants that differ in reward normalization (mean-only vs mean + variance) and in how they regularize updates using KL divergence: either penalizing divergence from the previous model (mirror), penalizing divergence from a fixed reference model $\pi_{\mathrm{ref}}$, or combining both forms of regularization. For each, the optimal policy $\pi_n$ admits an explicit form in terms of the binary reward and the first and second order statistics of the reward under $\pi_{n-1}$, as well as the policies $\pi_{n-1}$ and $\pi_{\mathrm{ref}}$. Iterating results in a sequence $\{\pi_n\}$ whose probability of success (PoS) obeys a simple recurrence that converges to a fixed point determined by the reference PoS and the regularization strength. We further show that this fixed point exceeds the reference, demonstrating that GRPO amplifies the policy's probability of success.</description>

      <title>T\'yr-the-Pruner: Structural Pruning LLMs via Global Sparsity Distribution Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09657v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural pruning enhances hardware-agnostic inference efficiency for large language models (LLMs) yet often fails to maintain comparable performance. Local pruning performs efficient layer-by-layer compression but ignores global topology. Although global pruning aims to identify an optimal sparse model, intuitive methods typically adopt a two-stage paradigm that first evaluates substructure saliency and then applies global pruning, which ignores inter-structure dependencies and fails to achieve end-to-end optimization. To address these limitations, we propose T\'yr-the-Pruner, an efficient end-to-end search-based global structural pruning framework. This framework constructs a supernet by repeatedly applying local pruning across a range of sparsity ratios to each layer in an LLM, with the core goal of determining the optimal sparsity distribution under a target overall sparsity ratio. Concretely, we introduce an effective local pruning and an expectation error accumulation approach to improve supernet construction. Furthermore, we employ an iterative prune-and-search strategy with coarse-to-fine sparsity granularity to ensure efficient search convergence. Experimental results show that T\'yr-the-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art structural pruning, retaining 97% of the dense model's performance while removing a challenging 50% of Llama-3.1-70B's parameters. Code will be available at https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Tyr-the-Pruner.</description>

      <title>Changing Base Without Losing Pace: A GPU-Efficient Alternative to MatMul in DNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern AI relies on huge matrix multiplications (MatMuls), whose computation poses a scalability problem for inference and training. We propose an alternative, GPU native bilinear operator to MatMuls in neural networks, which offers a three-way tradeoff between: speed, accuracy and parameter count. In particular, this operator requires substantially fewer FLOPs to evaluate ($\ll n^3$), yet increases the parameter count compared to MatMul ($\gg n^2$). We call this operator Strassen-Tile (STL). The key idea behind STL is a local learnable change-of-basis, applied on tiles of the weight and activation matrices, followed by an element-wise product between the tiles, implemented simultaneously via MatMul. The key technical question we study is how to optimize the change-of-basis of a given layer, which is a highly non-convex problem. We show that theory-backed initializations (inspired by fast matrix and polynomial multiplication) lead to substantially better accuracy than random SGD initialization. This phenomenon motivates further algorithmic study of STL optimization in DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate that STL can approximate 4x4 MatMul of tiles while reducing FLOPs by a factor of 2.66, and can improve Imagenet-1K accuracy of SoTA T2T-ViT-7 (4.3M parameters) while lowering FLOPs. Even with non-CUDA optimized PyTorch code, STL achieves wall-clock speedups in the compute-bound regime. These results, together with its theoretical grounds, suggest STL as a promising building block for scalable and cost-efficient AI.</description>

      <title>PAUSE: Low-Latency and Privacy-Aware Active User Selection for Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple edge devices to collaboratively train a machine learning model without the need to share potentially private data. Federated learning proceeds through iterative exchanges of model updates, which pose two key challenges: First, the accumulation of privacy leakage over time, and second, communication latency. These two limitations are typically addressed separately: The former via perturbed updates to enhance privacy and the latter using user selection to mitigate latency - both at the expense of accuracy. In this work, we propose a method that jointly addresses the accumulation of privacy leakage and communication latency via active user selection, aiming to improve the trade-off among privacy, latency, and model performance. To achieve this, we construct a reward function that accounts for these three objectives. Building on this reward, we propose a multi-armed bandit (MAB)-based algorithm, termed Privacy-aware Active User SElection (PAUSE) which dynamically selects a subset of users each round while ensuring bounded overall privacy leakage. We establish a theoretical analysis, systematically showing that the reward growth rate of PAUSE follows that of the best-known rate in MAB literature. To address the complexity overhead of active user selection, we propose a simulated annealing-based relaxation of PAUSE and analyze its ability to approximate the reward-maximizing policy under reduced complexity. We numerically validate the privacy leakage, associated improved latency, and accuracy gains of our methods for the federated training in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Efficient Verified Machine Unlearning For Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Growing data privacy demands, driven by regulations like GDPR and CCPA, require machine unlearning methods capable of swiftly removing the influence of specific training points. Although verified approaches like SISA, using data slicing and checkpointing, achieve efficient unlearning for single models by reverting to intermediate states, these methods struggle in teacher-student knowledge distillation settings. Unlearning in the teacher typically forces costly, complete student retraining due to pervasive information propagation during distillation. Our primary contribution is PURGE (Partitioned Unlearning with Retraining Guarantee for Ensembles), a novel framework integrating verified unlearning with distillation. We introduce constituent mapping and an incremental multi-teacher strategy that partitions the distillation process, confines each teacher constituent's impact to distinct student data subsets, and crucially maintains data isolation. The PURGE framework substantially reduces retraining overhead, requiring only partial student updates when teacher-side unlearning occurs. We provide both theoretical analysis, quantifying significant speed-ups in the unlearning process, and empirical validation on multiple datasets, demonstrating that PURGE achieves these efficiency gains while maintaining student accuracy comparable to standard baselines.</description>

      <title>Enabling Automatic Differentiation with Mollified Graph Neural Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural operators offer a powerful framework for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs) by combining data and physics losses. However, these physics losses rely on derivatives. Computing these derivatives remains challenging, with spectral and finite difference methods introducing approximation errors due to finite resolution. Here, we propose the mollified graph neural operator ($m$GNO), the first method to leverage automatic differentiation and compute exact gradients on arbitrary geometries. This enhancement enables efficient training on irregular grids and varying geometries while allowing seamless evaluation of physics losses at randomly sampled points for improved generalization. For a PDE example on regular grids, $m$GNO paired with autograd reduced the L2 relative data error by 20x compared to finite differences, although training was slower. It can also solve PDEs on unstructured point clouds seamlessly, using physics losses only, at resolutions vastly lower than those needed for finite differences to be accurate enough. On these unstructured point clouds, $m$GNO leads to errors that are consistently 2 orders of magnitude lower than machine learning baselines (Meta-PDE, which accelerates PINNs) for comparable runtimes, and also delivers speedups from 1 to 3 orders of magnitude compared to the numerical solver for similar accuracy. $m$GNOs can also be used to solve inverse design and shape optimization problems on complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Energy Matching: Unifying Flow Matching and Energy-Based Models for Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10612v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art generative models map noise to data distributions by matching flows or scores. A key limitation of these models is their inability to readily integrate available partial observations and additional priors. In contrast, energy-based models (EBMs) address this by incorporating corresponding scalar energy terms. Here, we propose Energy Matching, a framework that endows flow-based approaches with the flexibility of EBMs. Far from the data manifold, samples move from noise to data along irrotational, optimal transport paths. As they approach the data manifold, an entropic energy term guides the system into a Boltzmann equilibrium distribution, explicitly capturing the underlying likelihood structure of the data. We parameterize these dynamics with a single time-independent scalar field, which serves as both a powerful generator and a flexible prior for effective regularization of inverse problems. The present method substantially outperforms existing EBMs on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet generation in terms of fidelity, while retaining simulation-free training of transport-based approaches away from the data manifold. Furthermore, we leverage the flexibility of the method to introduce an interaction energy that supports the exploration of diverse modes, which we demonstrate in a controlled protein generation setting. This approach learns a scalar potential energy, without time conditioning, auxiliary generators, or additional networks, marking a significant departure from recent EBM methods. We believe this simplified yet rigorous formulation significantly advances EBMs capabilities and paves the way for their wider adoption in generative modeling in diverse domains.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have improved performance while also increasing computational demands. While federated and distributed setups address these issues, their structure is vulnerable to malicious influences. In this paper, we address a specific threat, Byzantine attacks, where compromised clients inject adversarial updates to derail global convergence. We combine the trust scores concept with trial function methodology to dynamically filter outliers. Our methods address the critical limitations of previous approaches, allowing functionality even when Byzantine nodes are in the majority. Moreover, our algorithms adapt to widely used scaled methods like Adam and RMSProp, as well as practical scenarios, including local training and partial participation. We validate the robustness of our methods by conducting extensive experiments on both synthetic and real ECG data collected from medical institutions. Furthermore, we provide a broad theoretical analysis of our algorithms and their extensions to aforementioned practical setups. The convergence guarantees of our methods are comparable to those of classical algorithms developed without Byzantine interference.</description>

      <title>Spike-timing-dependent Hebbian learning as noisy gradient descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hebbian learning is a key principle underlying learning in biological neural networks. We relate a Hebbian spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule to noisy gradient descent with respect to a non-convex loss function on the probability simplex. Despite the constant injection of noise and the non-convexity of the underlying optimization problem, one can rigorously prove that the considered Hebbian learning dynamic identifies the presynaptic neuron with the highest activity and that the convergence is exponentially fast in the number of iterations. This is non-standard and surprising as typically noisy gradient descent with fixed noise level only converges to a stationary regime where the noise causes the dynamic to fluctuate around a minimiser.</description>

      <title>FlashBias: Fast Computation of Attention with Bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attention with bias, which extends standard attention by introducing prior knowledge as an additive bias matrix to the query-key scores, has been widely deployed in vision, language, protein-folding and other advanced scientific models, underscoring its status as a key evolution of this foundational module. However, introducing bias terms creates a severe efficiency bottleneck in attention computation. It disrupts the tightly fused memory-compute pipeline that underlies the speed of accelerators like FlashAttention, thereby stripping away most of their performance gains and leaving biased attention computationally expensive. Surprisingly, despite its common usage, targeted efficiency optimization for attention with bias remains absent, which seriously hinders its application in complex tasks. Diving into the computation of FlashAttention, we prove that its optimal efficiency is determined by the rank of the attention weight matrix. Inspired by this theoretical result, this paper presents FlashBias based on the low-rank compressed sensing theory, which can provide fast-exact computation for many widely used attention biases and a fast-accurate approximation for biases in general formalizations. FlashBias can fully take advantage of the extremely optimized matrix multiplication operation in modern GPUs, achieving 1.5$\times$ speedup for Pairformer in AlphaFold 3, and over 2$\times$ speedup for attention with bias in vision and language models without loss of accuracy. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/thuml/FlashBias.</description>

      <title>Neural Graduated Assignment for Maximum Common Edge Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Maximum Common Edge Subgraph (MCES) problem is a crucial challenge with significant implications in domains such as biology and chemistry. Traditional approaches, which include transformations into max-clique and search-based algorithms, suffer from scalability issues when dealing with larger instances. This paper introduces ``Neural Graduated Assignment'' (NGA), a simple, scalable, unsupervised-training-based method that addresses these limitations. Central to NGA is stacking of differentiable assignment optimization with neural components, enabling high-dimensional parameterization of the matching process through a learnable temperature mechanism. We further theoretically analyze the learning dynamics of NGA, showing its design leads to fast convergence, better exploration-exploitation tradeoff, and ability to escape local optima. Extensive experiments across MCES computation, graph similarity estimation, and graph retrieval tasks reveal that NGA not only significantly improves computation time and scalability on large instances but also enhances performance compared to existing methodologies. The introduction of NGA marks a significant advancement in the computation of MCES and offers insights into other assignment problems.</description>

      <title>How Transformers Learn In-Context Recall Tasks? Optimality, Training Dynamics and Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the approximation capabilities, convergence speeds and on-convergence behaviors of transformers trained on in-context recall tasks -- which requires to recognize the \emph{positional} association between a pair of tokens from in-context examples. Existing theoretical results only focus on the in-context reasoning behavior of transformers after being trained for the \emph{one} gradient descent step. It remains unclear what is the on-convergence behavior of transformers being trained by gradient descent and how fast the convergence rate is. In addition, the generalization of transformers in one-step in-context reasoning has not been formally investigated. This work addresses these gaps. We first show that a class of transformers with either linear, ReLU or softmax attentions, is provably Bayes-optimal for an in-context recall task. When being trained with gradient descent, we show via a finite-sample analysis that the expected loss converges at linear rate to the Bayes risks. Moreover, we show that the trained transformers exhibit out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, i.e., generalizing to samples outside of the population distribution. Our theoretical findings are further supported by extensive empirical validations, showing that \emph{without} proper parameterization, models with larger expressive power surprisingly \emph{fail} to generalize OOD after being trained by gradient descent.</description>

      <title>Fair Supervised Learning Through Constraints on Smooth Nonconvex Unfairness-Measure Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new strategy for fair supervised machine learning is proposed. The main advantages of the proposed strategy as compared to others in the literature are as follows. (a) We introduce a new smooth nonconvex surrogate to approximate the Heaviside functions involved in discontinuous unfairness measures. The surrogate is based on smoothing methods from the optimization literature, and is new for the fair supervised learning literature. The surrogate is a tight approximation which ensures the trained prediction models are fair, as opposed to other (e.g., convex) surrogates that can fail to lead to a fair prediction model in practice. (b) Rather than rely on regularizers (that lead to optimization problems that are difficult to solve) and corresponding regularization parameters (that can be expensive to tune), we propose a strategy that employs hard constraints so that specific tolerances for unfairness can be enforced without the complications associated with the use of regularization. (c) Our proposed strategy readily allows for constraints on multiple (potentially conflicting) unfairness measures at the same time. Multiple measures can be considered with a regularization approach, but at the cost of having even more difficult optimization problems to solve and further expense for tuning. By contrast, through hard constraints, our strategy leads to optimization models that can be solved tractably with minimal tuning.</description>

      <title>Understanding Differential Transformer Unchains Pretrained Self-Attentions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential Transformer has recently gained significant attention for its impressive empirical performance, often attributed to its ability to perform noise canceled attention. However, precisely how differential attention achieves its empirical benefits remains poorly understood. Moreover, Differential Transformer architecture demands large-scale training from scratch, hindering utilization of open pretrained weights. In this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation of Differential Transformer, uncovering three key factors behind its success: (1) enhanced expressivity via negative attention, (2) reduced redundancy among attention heads, and (3) improved learning dynamics. Based on these findings, we propose DEX, a novel method to efficiently integrate the advantages of differential attention into pretrained language models. By reusing the softmax attention scores and adding a lightweight differential operation on the output value matrix, DEX effectively incorporates the key advantages of differential attention while remaining lightweight in both training and inference. Evaluations confirm that DEX substantially improves the pretrained LLMs across diverse benchmarks, achieving significant performance gains with minimal adaptation data (&lt; 0.01%).</description>

      <title>The Spacetime of Diffusion Models: An Information Geometry Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel geometric perspective on the latent space of diffusion models. We first show that the standard pullback approach, utilizing the deterministic probability flow ODE decoder, is fundamentally flawed. It provably forces geodesics to decode as straight segments in data space, effectively ignoring any intrinsic data geometry beyond the ambient Euclidean space. Complementing this view, diffusion also admits a stochastic decoder via the reverse SDE, which enables an information geometric treatment with the Fisher-Rao metric. However, a choice of $x_T$ as the latent representation collapses this metric due to memorylessness. We address this by introducing a latent spacetime $z=(x_t,t)$ that indexes the family of denoising distributions $p(x_0 | x_t)$ across all noise scales, yielding a nontrivial geometric structure. We prove these distributions form an exponential family and derive simulation-free estimators for curve lengths, enabling efficient geodesic computation. The resulting structure induces a principled Diffusion Edit Distance, where geodesics trace minimal sequences of noise and denoise edits between data. We also demonstrate benefits for transition path sampling in molecular systems, including constrained variants such as low-variance transitions and region avoidance.

      <title>MetaBox-v2: A Unified Benchmark Platform for Meta-Black-Box Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) streamlines the automation of optimization algorithm design through meta-learning. It typically employs a bi-level structure: the meta-level policy undergoes meta-training to reduce the manual effort required in developing algorithms for low-level optimization tasks. The original MetaBox (2023) provided the first open-source framework for reinforcement learning-based single-objective MetaBBO. However, its relatively narrow scope no longer keep pace with the swift advancement in this field. In this paper, we introduce MetaBox-v2 (https://github.com/MetaEvo/MetaBox) as a milestone upgrade with four novel features: 1) a unified architecture supporting RL, evolutionary, and gradient-based approaches, by which we reproduce $23$ up-to-date baselines; 2) efficient parallelization schemes, which reduce the training/testing time by $10-40$x; 3) a comprehensive benchmark suite of $18$ synthetic/realistic tasks ($1900$+ instances) spanning single-objective, multi-objective, multi-model, and multi-task optimization scenarios; 4) plentiful and extensible interfaces for custom analysis/visualization and integrating to external optimization tools/benchmarks. To show the utility of MetaBox-v2, we carry out a systematic case study that evaluates the built-in baselines in terms of the optimization performance, generalization ability and learning efficiency. Valuable insights are concluded from thorough and detailed analysis for practitioners and those new to the field.</description>

      <title>GraSS: Scalable Data Attribution with Gradient Sparsification and Sparse Projection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient-based data attribution methods, such as influence functions, are critical for understanding the impact of individual training samples without requiring repeated model retraining. However, their scalability is often limited by the high computational and memory costs associated with per-sample gradient computation. In this work, we propose GraSS, a novel gradient compression algorithm and its variants FactGraSS for linear layers specifically, that explicitly leverage the inherent sparsity of per-sample gradients to achieve sub-linear space and time complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving substantial speedups while preserving data influence fidelity. In particular, FactGraSS achieves up to 165% faster throughput on billion-scale models compared to the previous state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/TRAIS-Lab/GraSS.</description>

      <title>Inverse Q-Learning Done Right: Offline Imitation Learning in $Q^\pi$-Realizable MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of offline imitation learning in Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the goal is to learn a well-performing policy given a dataset of state-action pairs generated by an expert policy. Complementing a recent line of work on this topic that assumes the expert belongs to a tractable class of known policies, we approach this problem from a new angle and leverage a different type of structural assumption about the environment. Specifically, for the class of linear $Q^\pi$-realizable MDPs, we introduce a new algorithm called saddle-point offline imitation learning (\SPOIL), which is guaranteed to match the performance of any expert up to an additive error $\varepsilon$ with access to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples. Moreover, we extend this result to possibly non-linear $Q^\pi$-realizable MDPs at the cost of a worse sample complexity of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$. Finally, our analysis suggests a new loss function for training critic networks from expert data in deep imitation learning. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the neural net implementation of \SPOIL is superior to behavior cloning and competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Segment Policy Optimization: Effective Segment-Level Credit Assignment in RL for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models effectively using reinforcement learning (RL) remains a crucial challenge. Existing approaches primarily adopt two contrasting advantage estimation granularities: token-level methods (e.g., PPO) aim to provide fine-grained advantage signals but suffer from inaccurate estimation due to difficulties in training an accurate critic model. On the other extreme, trajectory-level methods (e.g., GRPO) solely rely on a coarse-grained advantage signal from the final reward, leading to imprecise credit assignment. To address these limitations, we propose Segment Policy Optimization (SPO), a novel RL framework that leverages segment-level advantage estimation at an intermediate granularity, achieving a better balance by offering more precise credit assignment than trajectory-level methods and requiring fewer estimation points than token-level methods, enabling accurate advantage estimation based on Monte Carlo (MC) without a critic model. SPO features three components with novel strategies: (1) flexible segment partition; (2) accurate segment advantage estimation; and (3) policy optimization using segment advantages, including a novel probability-mask strategy. We further instantiate SPO for two specific scenarios: (1) SPO-chain for short chain-of-thought (CoT), featuring novel cutpoint-based partition and chain-based advantage estimation, achieving $6$-$12$ percentage point improvements in accuracy over PPO and GRPO on GSM8K. (2) SPO-tree for long CoT, featuring novel tree-based advantage estimation, which significantly reduces the cost of MC estimation, achieving $7$-$11$ percentage point improvements over GRPO on MATH500 under 2K and 4K context evaluation. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/AIFrameResearch/SPO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequence models such as transformers require inputs to be represented as one-dimensional sequences. In vision, this typically involves flattening images using a fixed row-major (raster-scan) order. While full self-attention is permutation-equivariant, modern long-sequence transformers increasingly rely on architectural approximations that break this invariance and introduce sensitivity to patch ordering. We show that patch order significantly affects model performance in such settings, with simple alternatives like column-major or Hilbert curves yielding notable accuracy shifts. Motivated by this, we propose REOrder, a two-stage framework for discovering task-optimal patch orderings. First, we derive an information-theoretic prior by evaluating the compressibility of various patch sequences. Then, we learn a policy over permutations by optimizing a Plackett-Luce policy using REINFORCE. This approach enables efficient learning in a combinatorial permutation space. REOrder improves top-1 accuracy over row-major ordering on ImageNet-1K by up to 3.01% and Functional Map of the World by 13.35%.</description>

      <title>Noise-Robustness Through Noise: A Framework combining Asymmetric LoRA with Poisoning MoE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23868v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for adapting pre-trained language models to downstream tasks are susceptible to interference from noisy data. Conventional noise-handling approaches either rely on laborious data pre-processing or employ model architecture modifications prone to error accumulation. In contrast to existing noise-process paradigms, we propose a noise-robust adaptation method via asymmetric LoRA poisoning experts (LoPE), a novel framework that enhances model robustness to noise only with generated noisy data. Drawing inspiration from the mixture-of-experts architecture, LoPE strategically integrates a dedicated poisoning expert in an asymmetric LoRA configuration. Through a two-stage paradigm, LoPE performs noise injection on the poisoning expert during fine-tuning to enhance its noise discrimination and processing ability. During inference, we selectively mask the dedicated poisoning expert to leverage purified knowledge acquired by normal experts for noise-robust output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoPE achieves strong performance and robustness purely through the low-cost noise injection, which completely eliminates the requirement of data cleaning.</description>

      <title>Sign-SGD is the Golden Gate between Multi-Node to Single-Node Learning: Significant Boost via Parameter-Free Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quite recently, large language models have made a significant breakthrough across various disciplines. However, training them is an extremely resource-intensive task, even for major players with vast computing resources. One of the methods gaining popularity in light of these challenges is Sign-SGD. This method can be applied both as a memory-efficient approach in single-node training and as a gradient compression technique in the distributed learning. Nevertheless, it is impossible to automatically determine the effective stepsize from the theoretical standpoint. Indeed, it depends on the parameters of the dataset to which we do not have access in the real-world learning paradigm. To address this issue, we design several variants of single-node deterministic Sign-SGD. We extend our approaches to practical scenarios: stochastic single-node and multi-node learning, methods with incorporated momentum. We conduct extensive experiments on real machine learning problems that emphasize the practical applicability of our ideas.</description>

      <title>Denoising the Future: Top-p Distributions for Moving Through Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07578v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inference in dynamic probabilistic models is a complex task involving expensive operations. In particular, for Hidden Markov Models, the whole state space has to be enumerated for advancing in time. Even states with negligible probabilities are considered, resulting in computational inefficiency and increased noise due to the propagation of unlikely probability mass. We propose to denoise the future and speed up inference by using only the top-p states, i.e., the most probable states with accumulated probability p. We show that the error introduced by using only the top-p states is bound by p and the so-called minimal mixing rate of the underlying model. Moreover, in our empirical evaluation, we show that we can expect speedups of at least an order of magnitude, while the error in terms of total variation distance is below 0.09.</description>

      <title>Understanding In-Context Learning on Structured Manifolds: Bridging Attention to Kernel Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding-particularly in the context of structured geometric data-remains unexplored. This paper initiates a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on manifolds. We establish a novel connection between the attention mechanism and classical kernel methods, demonstrating that transformers effectively perform kernel-based prediction at a new query through its interaction with the prompt. This connection is validated by numerical experiments, revealing that the learned query-prompt scores for H\"older functions are highly correlated with the Gaussian kernel. Building on this insight, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension. Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as in-context kernel algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.</description>

      <title>FlexQuant: A Flexible and Efficient Dynamic Precision Switching Framework for LLM Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has exacerbated the memory bottleneck due to the widening gap between model parameter scaling and hardware capabilities. While post-training quantization techniques effectively reduce memory overhead, existing methods predominantly rely on static quantization strategies, which struggle to adapt to dynamic workloads. To address this, we propose FlexQuant, a dynamic precision-switching framework that optimizes the trade-off between inference speed and accuracy. Leveraging model perplexity entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence, FlexQuant enables fine-grained, layer-wise mixed-precision quantization and dynamically adjusts bit-widths during each token generation. FlexQuant provides a comprehensive analysis of quantization strategies, introduces a precision requirement model for optimal switching, and implements efficient fine-grained precision management. Evaluations demonstrate that FlexQuant achieves a 1.3x end-to-end speedup across diverse language tasks with negligible accuracy loss introduced. This framework offers a flexible and adaptive solution for efficient LLM deployment. Code is released at https://github.com/ZongwuWang/FlexQuant.git.</description>

      <title>Generative or Discriminative? Revisiting Text Classification in the Era of Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The comparison between discriminative and generative classifiers has intrigued researchers since Efron's seminal analysis of logistic regression versus discriminant analysis. While early theoretical work established that generative classifiers exhibit lower sample complexity but higher asymptotic error in simple linear settings, these trade-offs remain unexplored in the transformer era. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of modern generative and discriminative architectures - Auto-regressive modeling, Masked Language Modeling, Discrete Diffusion, and Encoders for text classification. Our study reveals that the classical 'two regimes' phenomenon manifests distinctly across different architectures and training paradigms. Beyond accuracy, we analyze sample efficiency, calibration, noise robustness, and ordinality across diverse scenarios. Our findings offer practical guidance for selecting the most suitable modeling approach based on real-world constraints such as latency and data limitations.</description>

      <title>PARALLELPROMPT: Extracting Parallelism from Large Language Model Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM serving systems typically treat user prompts as monolithic inputs, optimizing inference through decoding tricks or inter-query batching. However, many real-world prompts contain latent semantic parallelism--decomposable structures where subtasks can be executed independently to reduce latency while preserving meaning. We introduce PARALLELPROMPT, the first benchmark for measuring intra-query parallelism in natural user prompts. Our dataset comprises over 37,000 real-world prompts from public LLM chat logs, each annotated with a structured schema capturing task templates, shared context, and iteration inputs. These schemas are extracted using LLM-assisted prompting with rule-based multilingual validation. To evaluate the benefits of decomposition, we provide an execution suite that benchmarks serial vs. parallel strategies, measuring latency, structural adherence, and semantic fidelity. Our results show that intra-query parallelism can be successfully parsed in over 75% of curated datasets, unlocking up to 5x speedups on tasks like translation, comprehension, and comparative analysis, with minimal quality degradation. By releasing this benchmark, curation pipeline, and evaluation suite, we provide the first standardized testbed for studying structure-aware execution in LLM serving pipelines.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for establishing the universal approximation of transformer-type architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the universal approximation property (UAP) of transformer-type architectures, providing a unified theoretical framework that extends prior results on residual networks to models incorporating attention mechanisms. Our work identifies token distinguishability as a fundamental requirement for UAP and introduces a general sufficient condition that applies to a broad class of architectures. Leveraging an analyticity assumption on the attention layer, we can significantly simplify the verification of this condition, providing a non-constructive approach in establishing UAP for such architectures. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework by proving UAP for transformers with various attention mechanisms, including kernel-based and sparse attention mechanisms. The corollaries of our results either generalize prior works or establish UAP for architectures not previously covered. Furthermore, our framework offers a principled foundation for designing novel transformer architectures with inherent UAP guarantees, including those with specific functional symmetries. We propose examples to illustrate these insights.</description>

      <title>Class-wise Balancing Data Replay for Federated Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks. However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks, yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>TPP-SD: Accelerating Transformer Point Process Sampling with Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose TPP-SD, a novel approach that accelerates Transformer temporal point process (TPP) sampling by adapting speculative decoding (SD) techniques from language models. By identifying the structural similarities between thinning algorithms for TPPs and speculative decoding for language models, we develop an efficient sampling framework that leverages a smaller draft model to generate multiple candidate events, which are then verified by the larger target model in parallel. TPP-SD maintains the same output distribution as autoregressive sampling while achieving significant acceleration. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our approach produces samples from identical distributions as standard methods, but with 2-6$\times$ speedup. Our ablation studies analyze the impact of hyperparameters such as draft length and draft model size on sampling efficiency. TPP-SD bridges the gap between powerful Transformer TPP models and the practical need for rapid sequence sampling.</description>

      <title>Task Priors: Enhancing Model Evaluation by Considering the Entire Space of Downstream Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The grand goal of AI research, and particularly Self Supervised Learning (SSL), is to produce systems that can successfully solve any possible task. In contrast, current evaluation methods available to AI researchers typically rely on a fixed collection of hand-picked downstream benchmarks. Hence, a large amount of effort is put into designing and searching for large collection of evaluation tasks that can serve as a proxy of our grand goal. We argue that such a rigid evaluation protocol creates a silent bottleneck in AI research. To remedy that, we define a probabilistic space of downstream tasks obtained by adopting a distribution of tasks and by defining Task Priors. Under this view, one can evaluate a model's performance over the set of all possible downstream tasks. Our framework is the first to provide answers to key questions such as (i) what is the average performance of my model over all possible downstream tasks weighted by the probability to encounter each task? or (ii) what is the variance of my model's performance across all downstream tasks under the defined Task Priors? Beyond establishing a new standard for evaluation, we believe that Task Priors will accelerate the pace of research in SSL - where downstream task evaluation is the sole qualitative signal that researchers have access to.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Coreset Selection on Spurious Correlations and Group Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coreset selection methods have shown promise in reducing the training data size while maintaining model performance for data-efficient machine learning. However, as many datasets suffer from biases that cause models to learn spurious correlations instead of causal features, it is important to understand whether and how dataset reduction methods may perpetuate, amplify, or mitigate these biases. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the implications of data selection on the spurious bias levels of the selected coresets and the robustness of downstream models trained on them. We use an extensive experimental setting spanning ten different spurious correlations benchmarks, five score metrics to characterize sample importance/ difficulty, and five data selection policies across a broad range of coreset sizes. Thereby, we unravel a series of nontrivial nuances in interactions between sample difficulty and bias alignment, as well as dataset bias and resultant model robustness. For example, we find that selecting coresets using embedding-based sample characterization scores runs a comparatively lower risk of inadvertently exacerbating bias than selecting using characterizations based on learning dynamics. Most importantly, our analysis reveals that although some coreset selection methods could achieve lower bias levels by prioritizing difficult samples, they do not reliably guarantee downstream robustness.</description>

      <title>Who cuts emissions, who turns up the heat? causal machine learning estimates of energy efficiency interventions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reducing domestic energy demand is central to climate mitigation and fuel poverty strategies, yet the impact of energy efficiency interventions is highly heterogeneous. Using a causal machine learning model trained on nationally representative data of the English housing stock, we estimate average and conditional treatment effects of wall insulation on gas consumption, focusing on distributional effects across energy burden subgroups. While interventions reduce gas demand on average (by as much as 19 percent), low energy burden groups achieve substantial savings, whereas those experiencing high energy burdens see little to no reduction. This pattern reflects a behaviourally-driven mechanism: households constrained by high costs-to-income ratios (e.g. more than 0.1) reallocate savings toward improved thermal comfort rather than lowering consumption. Far from wasteful, such responses represent rational adjustments in contexts of prior deprivation, with potential co-benefits for health and well-being. These findings call for a broader evaluation framework that accounts for both climate impacts and the equity implications of domestic energy policy.</description>

      <title>Shuffle-R1: Efficient RL framework for Multimodal Large Language Models via Data-centric Dynamic Shuffle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1) Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.</description>

      <title>Inductive Domain Transfer In Misspecified Simulation-Based Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting, requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators, while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging, misspecified environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthesis procedures play a critical role in materials research, as they directly affect material properties. With data-driven approaches increasingly accelerating materials discovery, there is growing interest in extracting synthesis procedures from scientific literature as structured data. However, existing studies often rely on rigid, domain-specific schemas with predefined fields for structuring synthesis procedures or assume that synthesis procedures are linear sequences of operations, which limits their ability to capture the structural complexity of real-world procedures. To address these limitations, we adopt PROV-DM, an international standard for provenance information, which supports flexible, graph-based modeling of procedures. We present MatPROV, a dataset of PROV-DM-compliant synthesis procedures extracted from scientific literature using large language models. MatPROV captures structural complexities and causal relationships among materials, operations, and conditions through visually intuitive directed graphs. This representation enables machine-interpretable synthesis knowledge, opening opportunities for future research such as automated synthesis planning and optimization.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Measures: Discriminative Capacity of Representational Similarity Metrics Across Model Families</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04622v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory, silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity. Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families. These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.</description>

      <title>DreamPRM-1.5: Unlocking the Potential of Each Instance for Multimodal Process Reward Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training multimodal process reward models (PRMs) is hard due to (i) distribution shift between training set and test set and (ii) quality imbalance across training data samples. While domain-level reweighting (e.g., DreamPRM) aligns training with test-time objectives, it leaves a clear gap to an oracle upper bound (pass@N), even under a "sanity check" that uses test set data to probe headroom -- pointing to meta-level under-parameterization. We introduce DreamPRM-1.5, an instance-level reweighting framework that assigns an adaptive weight to every training example via bi-level optimization. To realize instance reweighting across scales, we develop two complementary regimes: Instance Table, which learns explicit per-sample weights and excels on small/medium data, and Instance Net, a lightweight neural network that generalizes better and scales to large corpora. A practical, stable training recipe -- time-scale matching between upper/lower updates, cold-start initialization, and bounded-range weights -- prevents divergence. Integrated with test-time scaling, DreamPRM-1.5 attains 84.6 accuracy on the MMMU validation set, 31.3 accuracy on R-Bench-V and, when paired with a leading backbone (e.g., GPT-5-mini), achieves first-place results on public multimodal reasoning leaderboards. Moreover, extensive experiments, including benchmark evaluations, baseline comparisons, and a sanity check, demonstrate that DreamPRM-1.5 closes the gap toward the oracle, achieves leading performance, and trains stably.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Graph Fusion for Incomplete Multi-view Semi-supervised Learning with Tensorial Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: View missing remains a significant challenge in graph-based multi-view semi-supervised learning, hindering their real-world applications. To address this issue, traditional methods introduce a missing indicator matrix and focus on mining partial structure among existing samples in each view for label propagation (LP). However, we argue that these disregarded missing samples sometimes induce discontinuous local structures, i.e., sub-clusters, breaking the fundamental smoothness assumption in LP. Consequently, such a Sub-Cluster Problem (SCP) would distort graph fusion and degrade classification performance. To alleviate SCP, we propose a novel incomplete multi-view semi-supervised learning method, termed AGF-TI. Firstly, we design an adversarial graph fusion scheme to learn a robust consensus graph against the distorted local structure through a min-max framework. By stacking all similarity matrices into a tensor, we further recover the incomplete structure from the high-order consistency information based on the low-rank tensor learning. Additionally, the anchor-based strategy is incorporated to reduce the computational complexity. An efficient alternative optimization algorithm combining a reduced gradient descent method is developed to solve the formulated objective, with theoretical convergence. Extensive experimental results on various datasets validate the superiority of our proposed AGF-TI as compared to state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>$\boldsymbol{\lambda}$-Orthogonality Regularization for Compatible Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval systems rely on representations learned by increasingly powerful models. However, due to the high training cost and inconsistencies in learned representations, there is significant interest in facilitating communication between representations and ensuring compatibility across independently trained neural networks. In the literature, two primary approaches are commonly used to adapt different learned representations: affine transformations, which adapt well to specific distributions but can significantly alter the original representation, and orthogonal transformations, which preserve the original structure with strict geometric constraints but limit adaptability. A key challenge is adapting the latent spaces of updated models to align with those of previous models on downstream distributions while preserving the newly learned representation spaces. In this paper, we impose a relaxed orthogonality constraint, namely $\lambda$-Orthogonality regularization, while learning an affine transformation, to obtain distribution-specific adaptation while retaining the original learned representations. Extensive experiments across various architectures and datasets validate our approach, demonstrating that it preserves the model's zero-shot performance and ensures compatibility across model updates.

      <title>A Generalized Bisimulation Metric of State Similarity between Markov Decision Processes: From Theoretical Propositions to Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bisimulation metric (BSM) is a powerful tool for computing state similarities within a Markov decision process (MDP), revealing that states closer in BSM have more similar optimal value functions. While BSM has been successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state representation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP scenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging. Prior work has attempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis of its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) between pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental properties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance bound on identical state spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.</description>

      <title>Wonder Wins Ways: Curiosity-Driven Exploration through Multi-Agent Contextual Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked, resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in sparse-reward environments.</description>

      <title>ProtoTS: Learning Hierarchical Prototypes for Explainable Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While deep learning has achieved impressive performance in time series forecasting, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its decision-making process for building trust in high-stakes scenarios. Existing interpretable models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS, a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability. Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model understanding and decision support.</description>

      <title>Learning to Interpret Weight Differences in Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finetuning (pretrained) language models is a standard approach for updating their internal parametric knowledge and specializing them to new tasks and domains. However, the corresponding model weight changes ("weight diffs") are not generally interpretable. While inspecting the finetuning dataset can give a sense of how the model might have changed, these datasets are often not publicly available or are too large to work with directly. Towards the goal of comprehensively understanding weight diffs in natural language, we introduce Diff Interpretation Tuning (DIT), a method that trains models to describe their own finetuning-induced modifications. Our approach uses synthetic, labeled weight diffs to train a DIT-adapter, which can be applied to a compatible finetuned model to make it describe how it has changed. We demonstrate in two proof-of-concept settings (reporting hidden behaviors and summarizing finetuned knowledge) that our method enables models to describe their finetuning-induced modifications using accurate natural language descriptions.</description>

      <title>Preference-driven Knowledge Distillation for Few-shot Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can efficiently process text-attributed graphs (TAGs) due to their message-passing mechanisms, but their training heavily relies on the human-annotated labels. Moreover, the complex and diverse local topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge. Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD) framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs. Our code is available.</description>

      <title>Deep Edge Filter: Return of the Human-Crafted Layer in Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Deep Edge Filter, a novel approach that applies high-pass filtering to deep neural network features to improve model generalizability. Our method is motivated by our hypothesis that neural networks encode task-relevant semantic information in high-frequency components while storing domain-specific biases in low-frequency components of deep features. By subtracting low-pass filtered outputs from original features, our approach isolates generalizable representations while preserving architectural integrity. Experimental results across diverse domains such as Vision, Text, 3D, and Audio demonstrate consistent performance improvements regardless of model architecture and data modality. Analysis reveals that our method induces feature sparsification and effectively isolates high-frequency components, providing empirical validation of our core hypothesis.

      <description>arXiv:2510.14586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding poses is crucial for structure-based drug design, yet existing methods struggle to balance speed, accuracy, and physical plausibility. We introduce Matcha, a novel molecular docking pipeline that combines multi-stage flow matching with learned scoring and physical validity filtering. Our approach consists of three sequential stages applied consecutively to refine docking predictions, each implemented as a flow matching model operating on appropriate geometric spaces ($\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, and $\mathrm{SO}(2)$). We enhance the prediction quality through a dedicated scoring model and apply unsupervised physical validity filters to eliminate unrealistic poses. Compared to various approaches, Matcha demonstrates superior performance on Astex and PDBbind test sets in terms of docking success rate and physical plausibility. Moreover, our method works approximately 25 times faster than modern large-scale co-folding models. The model weights and inference code to reproduce our results are available at https://github.com/LigandPro/Matcha.</description>

Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design, traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training. The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity, demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Mahalanobis: How Feature Geometry and Normalization Shape OOD Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the reliable deployment of deep learning models. hile Mahalanobis distance methods are widely used, the impact of representation geometry and normalization on their performance is not fully understood, which may limit their downstream application. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study across diverse image foundation models, datasets, and distance normalization schemes. First, our analysis shows that Mahalanobis-based methods aren't universally reliable. Second, we define the ideal geometry for data representations and demonstrate that spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality metrics can accurately predict a model's OOD performance. Finally, we analyze how normalization impacts OOD performance. Building upon these studies, we propose radially scaled $\ell_2$ normalization, a method that generalizes the standard $\ell_2$ normalization recently applied to Mahalanobis-based OOD detection. Our approach introduces a tunable parameter to directly control the radial geometry of the feature space, systematically contracting or expanding representations to significantly improve OOD detection performance. By bridging the gap between representation geometry, normalization, and OOD performance, our findings offer new insights into the design of more effective and reliable deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Soundness-Aware Level: A Microscopic Signature that Predicts LLM Reasoning Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong reasoning in large language models (LLMs), while their performance after RLVR varies dramatically across different base models. This raises a fundamental question: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this variation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses ("if-then" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via cross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition probabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its semantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key discovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their internal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness levels, becoming highly distinct for "strict" versus "noisy" rules. In contrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution regardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the Soundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that SAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical law (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek) and scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied to its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from unsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training in shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's internal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models.</description>

      <title>Language Models are Injective and Hence Invertible</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer components such as non-linear activations and normalization are inherently non-injective, suggesting that different inputs could map to the same output and prevent exact recovery of the input from a model's representations. In this paper, we challenge this view. First, we prove mathematically that transformer language models mapping discrete input sequences to their corresponding sequence of continuous representations are injective and therefore lossless, a property established at initialization and preserved during training. Second, we confirm this result empirically through billions of collision tests on six state-of-the-art language models, and observe no collisions. Third, we operationalize injectivity: we introduce SipIt, the first algorithm that provably and efficiently reconstructs the exact input text from hidden activations, establishing linear-time guarantees and demonstrating exact invertibility in practice. Overall, our work establishes injectivity as a fundamental and exploitable property of language models, with direct implications for transparency, interpretability, and safe deployment.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Strategic Doubly Robust (SDR) estimator, a novel framework that integrates strategic equilibrium modeling with doubly robust estimation for causal inference in strategic environments. SDR addresses endogenous treatment assignment arising from strategic agent behavior, maintaining double robustness while incorporating strategic considerations. Theoretical analysis confirms SDR's consistency and asymptotic normality under strategic unconfoundedness. Empirical evaluations demonstrate SDR's superior performance over baseline methods, achieving 7.6\%-29.3\% bias reduction across varying strategic strengths and maintaining robust scalability with agent populations. The framework provides a principled approach for reliable causal inference when agents respond strategically to interventions.</description>

      <title>ProSh: Probabilistic Shielding for Model-free Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety is a major concern in reinforcement learning (RL): we aim at developing RL systems that not only perform optimally, but are also safe to deploy by providing formal guarantees about their safety. To this end, we introduce Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh), a model-free algorithm for safe reinforcement learning under cost constraints. ProSh augments the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and enforces safety by applying a shield to the agent's policy distribution using a learned cost critic. The shield ensures that all sampled actions remain safe in expectation. We also show that optimality is preserved when the environment is deterministic. Since ProSh is model-free, safety during training depends on the knowledge we have acquired about the environment. We provide a tight upper-bound on the cost in expectation, depending only on the backup-critic accuracy, that is always satisfied during training. Under mild, practically achievable assumptions, ProSh guarantees safety even at training time, as shown in the experiments.</description>

      <title>Learning from Mistakes: Enhancing Harmful Meme Detection via Misjudgment Risk Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Internet memes have emerged as a popular multimodal medium, yet they are increasingly weaponized to convey harmful opinions through subtle rhetorical devices like irony and metaphor. Existing detection approaches, including MLLM-based techniques, struggle with these implicit expressions, leading to frequent misjudgments. This paper introduces PatMD, a novel approach that improves harmful meme detection by learning from and proactively mitigating these potential misjudgment risks. Our core idea is to move beyond superficial content-level matching and instead identify the underlying misjudgment risk patterns, proactively guiding the MLLMs to avoid known misjudgment pitfalls. We first construct a knowledge base where each meme is deconstructed into a misjudgment risk pattern explaining why it might be misjudged, either overlooking harmful undertones (false negative) or overinterpreting benign content (false positive). For a given target meme, PatMD retrieves relevant patterns and utilizes them to dynamically guide the MLLM's reasoning. Experiments on a benchmark of 6,626 memes across 5 harmful detection tasks show that PatMD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average of 8.30\% improvement in F1-score and 7.71\% improvement in accuracy, demonstrating strong generalizability and improved detection capability of harmful memes.</description>

      <title>MEET-Sepsis: Multi-Endogenous-View Enhanced Time-Series Representation Learning for Early Sepsis Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sepsis is a life-threatening infectious syndrome associated with high mortality in intensive care units (ICUs). Early and accurate sepsis prediction (SP) is critical for timely intervention, yet remains challenging due to subtle early manifestations and rapidly escalating mortality. While AI has improved SP efficiency, existing methods struggle to capture weak early temporal signals. This paper introduces a Multi-Endogenous-view Representation Enhancement (MERE) mechanism to construct enriched feature views, coupled with a Cascaded Dual-convolution Time-series Attention (CDTA) module for multi-scale temporal representation learning. The proposed MEET-Sepsis framework achieves competitive prediction accuracy using only 20% of the ICU monitoring time required by SOTA methods, significantly advancing early SP. Extensive validation confirms its efficacy. Code is available at: https://github.com/yueliangy/MEET-Sepsis.</description>

      <title>Airfoil optimization using Design-by-Morphing with minimized design-space dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective airfoil geometry optimization requires exploring a diverse range of designs using as few design variables as possible. This study introduces AirDbM, a Design-by-Morphing (DbM) approach specialized for airfoil optimization that systematically reduces design-space dimensionality. AirDbM selects an optimal set of 12 baseline airfoils from the UIUC airfoil database, which contains over 1,600 shapes, by sequentially adding the baseline that most increases the design capacity. With these baselines, AirDbM reconstructs 99 % of the database with a mean absolute error below 0.005, which matches the performance of a previous DbM approach that used more baselines. In multi-objective aerodynamic optimization, AirDbM demonstrates rapid convergence and achieves a Pareto front with a greater hypervolume than that of the previous larger-baseline study, where new Pareto-optimal solutions are discovered with enhanced lift-to-drag ratios at moderate stall tolerances. Furthermore, AirDbM demonstrates outstanding adaptability for reinforcement learning (RL) agents in generating airfoil geometry when compared to conventional airfoil parameterization methods, implying the broader potential of DbM in machine learning-driven design.</description>

      <title>Expressive Reward Synthesis with the Runtime Monitoring Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is reward (mis)specification, whereby imprecisely defined reward functions can result in unintended, possibly harmful, behaviours. Indeed, reward functions in RL are typically treated as black-box mappings from state-action pairs to scalar values. While effective in many settings, this approach provides no information about why rewards are given, which can hinder learning and interpretability. Reward Machines address this issue by representing reward functions as finite state automata, enabling the specification of structured, non-Markovian reward functions. However, their expressivity is typically bounded by regular languages, leaving them unable to capture more complex behaviours such as counting or parametrised conditions. In this work, we build on the Runtime Monitoring Language (RML) to develop a novel class of language-based Reward Machines. By leveraging the built-in memory of RML, our approach can specify reward functions for non-regular, non-Markovian tasks. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our approach through experiments, highlighting additional advantages in flexible event-handling and task specification over existing Reward Machine-based methods.</description>

      <title>Diverse Influence Component Analysis: A Geometric Approach to Nonlinear Mixture Identifiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Latent component identification from unknown nonlinear mixtures is a foundational challenge in machine learning, with applications in tasks such as disentangled representation learning and causal inference. Prior work in nonlinear independent component analysis (nICA) has shown that auxiliary signals -- such as weak supervision -- can support identifiability of conditionally independent latent components. More recent approaches explore structural assumptions, e.g., sparsity in the Jacobian of the mixing function, to relax such requirements. In this work, we introduce Diverse Influence Component Analysis (DICA), a framework that exploits the convex geometry of the mixing function's Jacobian. We propose a Jacobian Volume Maximization (J-VolMax) criterion, which enables latent component identification by encouraging diversity in their influence on the observed variables. Under reasonable conditions, this approach achieves identifiability without relying on auxiliary information, latent component independence, or Jacobian sparsity assumptions. These results extend the scope of identifiability analysis and offer a complementary perspective to existing methods.</description>

      <title>TrajMamba: An Efficient and Semantic-rich Vehicle Trajectory Pre-training Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vehicle GPS trajectories record how vehicles move over time, storing valuable travel semantics, including movement patterns and travel purposes. Learning travel semantics effectively and efficiently is crucial for real-world applications of trajectory data, which is hindered by two major challenges. First, travel purposes are tied to the functions of the roads and points-of-interest (POIs) involved in a trip. Such information is encoded in textual addresses and descriptions and introduces heavy computational burden to modeling. Second, real-world trajectories often contain redundant points, which harm both computational efficiency and trajectory embedding quality. To address these challenges, we propose TrajMamba, a novel approach for efficient and semantically rich vehicle trajectory learning. TrajMamba introduces a Traj-Mamba Encoder that captures movement patterns by jointly modeling both GPS and road perspectives of trajectories, enabling robust representations of continuous travel behaviors. It also incorporates a Travel Purpose-aware Pre-training procedure to integrate travel purposes into the learned embeddings without introducing extra overhead to embedding calculation. To reduce redundancy in trajectories, TrajMamba features a Knowledge Distillation Pre-training scheme to identify key trajectory points through a learnable mask generator and obtain effective compressed trajectory embeddings. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and three downstream tasks show that TrajMamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Enabling Fine-Grained Operating Points for Black-Box LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black-box Large Language Models (LLMs) provide practical and accessible alternatives to other machine learning methods, as they require minimal labeled data and machine learning expertise to develop solutions for various decision making problems. However, for applications that need operating with constraints on specific metrics (e.g., precision $\geq$ 95%), decision making with black-box LLMs remains unfavorable, due to their low numerical output cardinalities. This results in limited control over their operating points, preventing fine-grained adjustment of their decision making behavior. In this paper, we study using black-box LLMs as classifiers, focusing on efficiently improving their operational granularity without performance loss. Specifically, we first investigate the reasons behind their low-cardinality numerical outputs and show that they are biased towards generating rounded but informative verbalized probabilities. Then, we experiment with standard prompt engineering, uncertainty estimation and confidence elicitation techniques, and observe that they do not effectively improve operational granularity without sacrificing performance or increasing inference cost. Finally, we propose efficient approaches to significantly increase the number and diversity of available operating points. Our proposed approaches provide finer-grained operating points and achieve comparable to or better performance than the benchmark methods across 11 datasets and 3 LLMs.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Road Safety Modeling: Datasets and Evaluations for Accident Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of traffic accident analysis on a road network based on road network connections and traffic volume. Previous works have designed various deep-learning methods using historical records to predict traffic accident occurrences. However, there is a lack of consensus on how accurate existing methods are, and a fundamental issue is the lack of public accident datasets for comprehensive evaluations. This paper constructs a large-scale, unified dataset of traffic accident records from official reports of various states in the US, totaling 9 million records, accompanied by road networks and traffic volume reports. Using this new dataset, we evaluate existing deep-learning methods for predicting the occurrence of accidents on road networks. Our main finding is that graph neural networks such as GraphSAGE can accurately predict the number of accidents on roads with less than 22% mean absolute error (relative to the actual count) and whether an accident will occur or not with over 87% AUROC, averaged over states. We achieve these results by using multitask learning to account for cross-state variabilities (e.g., availability of accident labels) and transfer learning to combine traffic volume with accident prediction. Ablation studies highlight the importance of road graph-structural features, amongst other features. Lastly, we discuss the implications of the analysis and develop a package for easily using our new dataset.</description>

Abstract: Robot learning of manipulation skills is hindered by the scarcity of diverse, unbiased datasets. While curated datasets can help, challenges remain in generalizability and real-world transfer. Meanwhile, large-scale "in-the-wild" video datasets have driven progress in computer vision through self-supervised techniques. Translating this to robotics, recent works have explored learning manipulation skills by passively watching abundant videos sourced online. Showing promising results, such video-based learning paradigms provide scalable supervision while reducing dataset bias. This survey reviews foundations such as video feature representation learning techniques, object affordance understanding, 3D hand/body modeling, and large-scale robot resources, as well as emerging techniques for acquiring robot manipulation skills from uncontrolled video demonstrations. We discuss how learning only from observing large-scale human videos can enhance generalization and sample efficiency for robotic manipulation. The survey summarizes video-based learning approaches, analyses their benefits over standard datasets, survey metrics, and benchmarks, and discusses open challenges and future directions in this nascent domain at the intersection of computer vision, natural language processing, and robot learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling large-scale time series has gained significant attention in recent years. However, its direct application in finance remains challenging due to substantial differences in data characteristics across domains. Specifically, financial systems feature inherent stochasticity and low signal-to-noise ratios, rendering traditional methods and pre-training approaches ineffective. This underscores the urgent need for a foundation model tailored to financial time series. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{LENS}, a pre-trained model for this domain. \textbf{LENS} effectively captures the complexity of financial stochastic systems through a carefully crafted model architecture and mitigates noise during pre-training by using an invertible embedding module. We provide a rigorous theoretical explanation of the model's effectiveness and validate its performance through extensive experiments. Pre-trained on a dataset comprising 100 billion financial observations, \textbf{LENS} achieves exceptional results across a wide range of critical downstream tasks. Moreover, our work offers practical insights into developing pre-trained time series models in high-noise environments, paving the way for further advancements in this pivotal research domain.</description>

      <title>Generation of Uncertainty-Aware Emergent Concepts in Factorized 3D Scene Graphs via Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enabling robots to autonomously discover emergent spatial concepts (e.g., rooms) from primitive geometric observations (e.g., planar surfaces) within 3D Scene Graphs is essential for robust indoor navigation and mapping. These graphs provide a hierarchical metric-semantic representation in which such concepts are organized. To further enhance graph-SLAM performance, Factorized 3D Scene Graphs incorporate these concepts as optimization factors that constrain relative geometry and enforce global consistency. However, both stages of this process remain largely manual: concepts are typically derived using hand-crafted, concept-specific heuristics, while factors and their covariances are likewise manually designed. This reliance on manual specification limits generalization across diverse environments and scalability to new concept classes. This paper presents, for the first time, a learning-based method to generate online spatial emergent concepts as optimizable factors within a SLAM backend, reducing the need to handcraft both concept generation and the definition of their corresponding factors and covariances. In both simulated and real indoor scenarios, our approach improves complex concept detection by 20.7% and 5.3%, trajectory estimation by 19.2%, and map reconstruction by 12.3% and 3.8%, respectively, highlighting the benefits of this integration for robust and adaptive spatial understanding.</description>

      <title>Implicit Neural Compression of Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point clouds have gained prominence across numerous applications due to their ability to accurately represent 3D objects and scenes. However, efficiently compressing unstructured, high-precision point cloud data remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose NeRC$^3$, a novel point cloud compression framework that leverages implicit neural representations (INRs) to encode both geometry and attributes of dense point clouds. Our approach employs two coordinate-based neural networks: one maps spatial coordinates to voxel occupancy, while the other maps occupied voxels to their attributes, thereby implicitly representing the geometry and attributes of a voxelized point cloud. The encoder quantizes and compresses network parameters alongside auxiliary information required for reconstruction, while the decoder reconstructs the original point cloud by inputting voxel coordinates into the neural networks. Furthermore, we extend our method to dynamic point cloud compression through techniques that reduce temporal redundancy, including a 4D spatio-temporal representation termed 4D-NeRC$^3$. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach: For static point clouds, NeRC$^3$ outperforms octree-based G-PCC standard and existing INR-based methods. For dynamic point clouds, 4D-NeRC$^3$ achieves superior geometry compression performance compared to the latest G-PCC and V-PCC standards, while matching state-of-the-art learning-based methods. It also demonstrates competitive performance in joint geometry and attribute compression.</description>

      <title>On Generalization and Distributional Update for Mimicking Observations with Adequate Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning from observations (LfO) replicates expert behavior without needing access to the expert's actions, making it more practical than learning from demonstrations (LfD) in many real-world scenarios. However, directly applying the on-policy training scheme in LfO worsens the sample inefficiency problem, while employing the traditional off-policy training scheme in LfO magnifies the instability issue. This paper seeks to develop an efficient and stable solution for the LfO problem. Specifically, we begin by exploring the generalization capabilities of both the reward function and policy in LfO, which provides a theoretical foundation for computation. Building on this, we modify the policy optimization method in generative adversarial imitation from observation (GAIfO) with distributional soft actor-critic (DSAC), and propose the Mimicking Observations through Distributional Update Learning with adequate Exploration (MODULE) algorithm to solve the LfO problem. MODULE incorporates the advantages of (1) high sample efficiency and training robustness enhancement in soft actor-critic (SAC), and (2) training stability in distributional reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments in MuJoCo environments showcase the superior performance of MODULE over current LfO methods.</description>

      <title>Molecular Fingerprints Are Strong Models for Peptide Function Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding peptide properties is often assumed to require modeling long-range molecular interactions, motivating the use of complex graph neural networks and pretrained transformers. Yet, whether such long-range dependencies are essential remains unclear. We investigate if simple, domain-specific molecular fingerprints can capture peptide function without these assumptions. Atomic-level representation aims to provide richer information than purely sequence-based models and better efficiency than structural ones. Across 132 datasets, including LRGB and five other peptide benchmarks, models using count-based ECFP, Topological Torsion, and RDKit fingerprints with LightGBM achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. Despite encoding only short-range molecular features, these models outperform GNNs and transformer-based approaches. Control experiments with sequence shuffling and amino acid counts confirm that fingerprints, though inherently local, suffice for robust peptide property prediction. Our results challenge the presumed necessity of long-range interaction modeling and highlight molecular fingerprints as efficient, interpretable, and computationally lightweight alternatives for peptide prediction.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs Strategically Reveal, Conceal, and Infer Information? A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis in The Chameleon Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model-based (LLM-based) agents have become common in settings that include non-cooperative parties. In such settings, agents' decision-making needs to conceal information from their adversaries, reveal information to their cooperators, and infer information to identify the other agents' characteristics. To investigate whether LLMs have these information control and decision-making capabilities, we make LLM agents play the language-based hidden-identity game, The Chameleon. In this game, a group of non-chameleon agents who do not know each other aim to identify the chameleon agent without revealing a secret. The game requires the aforementioned information control capabilities both as a chameleon and a non-chameleon. We begin with a theoretical analysis for a spectrum of strategies, from concealing to revealing, and provide bounds on the non-chameleons' winning probability. The empirical results with GPT, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3.1, and Qwen3 models show that while non-chameleon LLM agents identify the chameleon, they fail to conceal the secret from the chameleon, and their winning probability is far from the levels of even trivial strategies. Based on these empirical results and our theoretical analysis, we deduce that LLM-based agents may reveal excessive information to agents of unknown identities. Interestingly, we find that, when instructed to adopt an information-revealing level, this level is linearly encoded in the LLM's internal representations. While the instructions alone are often ineffective at making non-chameleon LLMs conceal, we show that steering the internal representations in this linear direction directly can reliably induce concealing behavior.</description>

      <title>Dynamic object goal pushing with mobile manipulators through model-free constrained reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-prehensile pushing to move and reorient objects to a goal is a versatile loco-manipulation skill. In the real world, the object's physical properties and friction with the floor contain significant uncertainties, which makes the task challenging for a mobile manipulator. In this paper, we develop a learning-based controller for a mobile manipulator to move an unknown object to a desired position and yaw orientation through a sequence of pushing actions. The proposed controller for the robotic arm and the mobile base motion is trained using a constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) formulation. We demonstrate its capability in experiments with a quadrupedal robot equipped with an arm. The learned policy achieves a success rate of 91.35% in simulation and at least 80% on hardware in challenging scenarios. Through our extensive hardware experiments, we show that the approach demonstrates high robustness against unknown objects of different masses, materials, sizes, and shapes. It reactively discovers the pushing location and direction, thus achieving contact-rich behavior while observing only the pose of the object. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptive behavior of the learned policy towards preventing the object from toppling.</description>

      <title>The $\varphi$ Curve: The Shape of Generalization through the Lens of Norm-based Capacity Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how the test risk scales with model complexity is a central question in machine learning. Classical theory is challenged by the learning curves observed for large over-parametrized deep networks. Capacity measures based on parameter count typically fail to account for these empirical observations. To tackle this challenge, we consider norm-based capacity measures and develop our study for random features based estimators, widely used as simplified theoretical models for more complex networks. In this context, we provide a precise characterization of how the estimator's norm concentrates and how it governs the associated test error. Our results show that the predicted learning curve admits a phase transition from under- to over-parameterization, but no double descent behavior. This confirms that more classical U-shaped behavior is recovered considering appropriate capacity measures based on models norms rather than size. From a technical point of view, we leverage deterministic equivalence as the key tool and further develop new deterministic quantities which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>VLA-Cache: Efficient Vision-Language-Action Manipulation via Adaptive Token Caching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities, enabling direct action generation from visual perception and language instructions in an end-to-end manner. However, their substantial computational cost poses a challenge for real-time robotic control, where rapid decision-making is essential. This paper introduces VLA-Cache, a training-free inference acceleration method that reduces computational overhead by adaptively caching and reusing static visual tokens across frames. Exploiting the temporal continuity in robotic manipulation, VLA-Cache identifies minimally changed tokens between adjacent frames and reuses their cached key-value representations, thereby circumventing redundant computations. Additionally, to maintain action precision, VLA-Cache selectively re-computes task-relevant tokens that are environmentally sensitive, ensuring the fidelity of critical visual information. To further optimize efficiency, we introduce a layer adaptive token reusing strategy that dynamically adjusts the reuse ratio based on attention concentration across decoder layers, prioritizing critical tokens for recomputation. Extensive experiments on two simulation platforms (LIBERO and SIMPLER) and a real-world robotic system demonstrate that VLA-Cache achieves up to 1.7x speedup in CUDA latency and a 15% increase in control frequency, with negligible loss on task success rate.

      <title>Foundations of a Developmental Design Paradigm for Integrated Continual Learning, Deliberative Behavior, and Comprehensibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inherent limitations of contemporary machine learning systems in crucial areas -- importantly in continual learning, information reuse, comprehensibility, and integration with deliberate behavior -- are receiving increasing attention. To address these challenges, we introduce a system design, fueled by a novel learning approach conceptually grounded in principles of evolutionary developmental biology, that overcomes key limitations of current methods. Our design comprises three core components: The Modeller, a gradient-free learning mechanism inherently capable of continual learning and structural adaptation; a planner for goal-directed action over learned models; and a behavior encapsulation mechanism that can decompose complex behaviors into a hierarchical structure. We demonstrate proof-of-principle operation in a simple test environment. Additionally, we extend our modeling framework to higher-dimensional network-structured spaces, using MNIST for a shape detection task. Our framework shows promise in overcoming multiple major limitations of contemporary machine learning systems simultaneously and in an organic manner.</description>

      <title>Modeling Human Beliefs about AI Behavior for Scalable Oversight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI systems advance beyond human capabilities, scalable oversight becomes critical: how can we supervise AI that exceeds our abilities? A key challenge is that human evaluators may form incorrect beliefs about AI behavior in complex tasks, leading to unreliable feedback and poor value inference. To address this, we propose modeling evaluators' beliefs to interpret their feedback more reliably. We formalize human belief models, analyze their theoretical role in value learning, and characterize when ambiguity remains. To reduce reliance on precise belief models, we introduce "belief model covering" as a relaxation. This motivates our preliminary proposal to use the internal representations of adapted foundation models to mimic human evaluators' beliefs. These representations could be used to learn correct values from human feedback even when evaluators misunderstand the AI's behavior. Our work suggests that modeling human beliefs can improve value learning and outlines practical research directions for implementing this approach to scalable oversight.</description>

      <title>Improving Diffusion-based Inverse Algorithms under Few-Step Constraint via Learnable Linear Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based inverse algorithms have shown remarkable performance across various inverse problems, yet their reliance on numerous denoising steps incurs high computational costs. While recent developments of fast diffusion ODE solvers offer effective acceleration for diffusion sampling without observations, their application in inverse problems remains limited due to the heterogeneous formulations of inverse algorithms and their prevalent use of approximations and heuristics, which often introduce significant errors that undermine the reliability of analytical solvers. In this work, we begin with an analysis of ODE solvers for inverse problems that reveals a linear combination structure of approximations for the inverse trajectory. Building on this insight, we propose a canonical form that unifies a broad class of diffusion-based inverse algorithms and facilitates the design of more generalizable solvers. Inspired by the linear subspace search strategy, we propose Learnable Linear Extrapolation (LLE), a lightweight approach that universally enhances the performance of any diffusion-based inverse algorithm conforming to our canonical form. LLE optimizes the combination coefficients to refine current predictions using previous estimates, alleviating the sensitivity of analytical solvers for inverse algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements of the proposed LLE method across multiple algorithms and tasks, indicating its potential for more efficient solutions and boosted performance of diffusion-based inverse algorithms with limited steps. Codes for reproducing our experiments are available at https://github.com/weigerzan/LLE_inverse_problem.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Test-time Adaptation for NLU tasks Involving Dialects of English</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Test-time domain adaptation (TTDA) is an excellent method which helps generalize models across domains, tasks, and distributions without the use of labeled datasets. Thus, TTDA is very useful in natural language processing (NLP) in the dialectal setting, since oftentimes, models are trained on Standard American English (SAE), evaluated on Indian English (IndE), Singaporean English (SingE), or Nigerian English (NgE), of which distribution differs significantly from the former. This is especially useful since dialectal datasets are scarce. In this paper, we explore one of the most famous TTDA techniques, SHOT, in dialectal NLP. We finetune and evaluate SHOT on different combinations of dialectal GLUE. Our findings show that SHOT is a viable technique when labeled datasets are unavailable. We also theoretically propose the concept of dialectal gap and show that it has a positive correlation with the effectiveness of SHOT. We also find that in many cases, finetuning on SAE yields higher performance than finetuning on dialectal data.</description>

      <title>A representational framework for learning and encoding structurally enriched trajectories in complex agent environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability of artificial intelligence agents to make optimal decisions and generalise them to different domains and tasks is compromised in complex scenarios. One way to address this issue has focused on learning efficient representations of the world and on how the actions of agents affect them in state-action transitions. Whereas such representations are procedurally efficient, they lack structural richness. To address this problem, we propose to enhance the agent's ontology and extend the traditional conceptualisation of trajectories to provide a more nuanced view of task execution. Structurally Enriched Trajectories (SETs) extend the encoding of sequences of states and their transitions by incorporating hierarchical relations between objects, interactions, and affordances. SETs are built as multi-level graphs, providing a detailed representation of the agent dynamics and a transferable functional abstraction of the task. SETs are integrated into an architecture, Structurally Enriched Trajectory Learning and Encoding (SETLE), that employs a heterogeneous graph-based memory structure of multi-level relational dependencies essential for generalisation. We demonstrate that SETLE can support downstream tasks, enabling agents to recognise task relevant structural patterns across CREATE and MiniGrid environments. Finally, we integrate SETLE with reinforcement learning and show measurable improvements in downstream performance, including breakthrough success rates in complex, sparse-reward tasks.</description>

      <title>Low-cost Embedded Breathing Rate Determination Using 802.15.4z IR-UWB Hardware for Remote Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Respiratory diseases account for a significant portion of global mortality. Affordable and early detection is an effective way of addressing these ailments. To this end, a low-cost commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), IEEE 802.15.4z standard compliant impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar system is used to estimate human respiration rates. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) specifically adapted to predict breathing rates from ultra-wideband (UWB) channel impulse response (CIR) data, and compare its performance with both other rule-based algorithms and model-based solutions. The study uses a diverse dataset, incorporating various real-life environments to evaluate system robustness. To facilitate future research, this dataset will be released as open source. Results show that the CNN achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.73 breaths per minute (BPM) in unseen situations, significantly outperforming rule-based methods (3.40 BPM). By incorporating calibration data from other individuals in the unseen situations, the error is further reduced to 0.84 BPM. In addition, this work evaluates the feasibility of running the pipeline on a low-cost embedded device. Applying 8-bit quantization to both the weights and input/ouput tensors, reduces memory requirements by 67% and inference time by 64% with only a 3% increase in MAE. As a result, we show it is feasible to deploy the algorithm on an nRF52840 system-on-chip (SoC) requiring only 46 KB of memory and operating with an inference time of only 192 ms. Once deployed, an analytical energy model estimates that the system, while continuously monitoring the room, can operate for up to 268 days without recharging when powered by a 20 000 mAh battery pack. For breathing monitoring in bed, the sampling rate can be lowered, extending battery life to 313 days, making the solution highly efficient for real-world, low-cost deployments.</description>

      <title>REPA-E: Unlocking VAE for End-to-End Tuning with Latent Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we tackle a fundamental question: "Can we train latent diffusion models together with the variational auto-encoder (VAE) tokenizer in an end-to-end manner?" Traditional deep-learning wisdom dictates that end-to-end training is often preferable when possible. However, for latent diffusion transformers, it is observed that end-to-end training both VAE and diffusion-model using standard diffusion-loss is ineffective, even causing a degradation in final performance. We show that while diffusion loss is ineffective, end-to-end training can be unlocked through the representation-alignment (REPA) loss -- allowing both VAE and diffusion model to be jointly tuned during the training process. Despite its simplicity, the proposed training recipe (REPA-E) shows remarkable performance; speeding up diffusion model training by over 17x and 45x over REPA and vanilla training recipes, respectively. Interestingly, we observe that end-to-end tuning with REPA-E also improves the VAE itself; leading to improved latent space structure and downstream generation performance. In terms of final performance, our approach sets a new state-of-the-art; achieving FID of 1.12 and 1.69 with and without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256 x 256.

      <title>VLLFL: A Vision-Language Model Based Lightweight Federated Learning Framework for Smart Agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern smart agriculture, object detection plays a crucial role by enabling automation, precision farming, and monitoring of resources. From identifying crop health and pest infestations to optimizing harvesting processes, accurate object detection enhances both productivity and sustainability. However, training object detection models often requires large-scale data collection and raises privacy concerns, particularly when sensitive agricultural data is distributed across farms. To address these challenges, we propose VLLFL, a vision-language model-based lightweight federated learning framework (VLLFL). It harnesses the generalization and context-aware detection capabilities of the vision-language model (VLM) and leverages the privacy-preserving nature of federated learning. By training a compact prompt generator to boost the performance of the VLM deployed across different farms, VLLFL preserves privacy while reducing communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that VLLFL achieves 14.53% improvement in the performance of VLM while reducing 99.3% communication overhead. Spanning tasks from identifying a wide variety of fruits to detecting harmful animals in agriculture, the proposed framework offers an efficient, scalable, and privacy-preserving solution specifically tailored to agricultural applications.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity And Complex Test Data Generation For Google SQL Code Generation Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The demand for high-fidelity test data is paramount in industrial settings where access to production data is largely restricted. Traditional data generation methods often fall short, struggling with low-fidelity and the ability to model complex data structures and semantic relationships that are critical for testing complex SQL code generation services like Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL). In this paper, we address the critical need for generating syntactically correct and semantically relevant high-fidelity mock data for complex data structures that includes columns with nested structures that we frequently encounter in Google workloads. We highlight the limitations of existing approaches used in production, particularly their inability to handle large and complex data structures, as well as the lack of semantically coherent test data that lead to limited test coverage. We demonstrate that by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and incorporating strategic pre- and post-processing steps, we can generate syntactically correct and semantically relevant high-fidelity test data that adheres to complex structural constraints and maintains semantic integrity to the SQL test targets (queries/functions). This approach supports comprehensive testing of complex SQL queries involving joins, aggregations, and even deeply nested subqueries, ensuring robust evaluation of SQL code generation services, like NL2SQL and SQL Code Assistant. Our results demonstrate the practical utility of an LLM (\textit{gemini}) based test data generation for industrial SQL code generation services where generating high-fidelity test data is essential due to the frequent unavailability and inaccessibility of production datasets for testing.</description>

      <title>Pretraining a Shared Q-Network for Data-Efficient Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy from a static dataset without further interactions with the environment. Collecting sufficiently large datasets for offline RL is exhausting since this data collection requires colossus interactions with environments and becomes tricky when the interaction with the environment is restricted. Hence, how an agent learns the best policy with a minimal static dataset is a crucial issue in offline RL, similar to the sample efficiency problem in online RL. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play pretraining method to initialize a feature of a Q-network to enhance data efficiency in offline RL. Specifically, we introduce a shared Q-network structure that outputs predictions of the next state and Q-value. We pretrain the shared Q-network through a supervised regression task that predicts a next state and trains the shared Q-network using diverse offline RL methods. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of existing popular offline RL methods on the D4RL, Robomimic and V-D4RL benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that our method significantly boosts data-efficient offline RL across various data qualities and data distributions trough D4RL and ExoRL benchmarks. Notably, our method adapted with only 10% of the dataset outperforms standard algorithms even with full datasets.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Spatiotemporal Deep Learning Framework for Turbulent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluid thermodynamics underpins atmospheric dynamics, climate science, industrial applications, and energy systems. However, direct numerical simulations (DNS) of such systems can be computationally prohibitive. To address this, we present a novel physics-informed spatiotemporal surrogate model for Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC), a canonical example of convective fluid flow. Our approach combines convolutional neural networks, for spatial dimension reduction, with an innovative recurrent architecture, inspired by large language models, to model long-range temporal dynamics. Inference is penalized with respect to the governing partial differential equations to ensure physical interpretability. Since RBC exhibits turbulent behavior, we quantify uncertainty using a conformal prediction framework. This model replicates key physical features of RBC dynamics while significantly reducing computational cost, offering a scalable alternative to DNS for long-term simulations.</description>

      <title>Backward Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce $\textit{Backward Conformal Prediction}$, a method that guarantees conformal coverage while providing flexible control over the size of prediction sets. Unlike standard conformal prediction, which fixes the coverage level and allows the conformal set size to vary, our approach defines a rule that constrains how prediction set sizes behave based on the observed data, and adapts the coverage level accordingly. Our method builds on two key foundations: (i) recent results by Gauthier et al. [2025] on post-hoc validity using e-values, which ensure marginal coverage of the form $\mathbb{P}(Y_{\rm test} \in \hat C_n^{\tilde{\alpha}}(X_{\rm test})) \ge 1 - \mathbb{E}[\tilde{\alpha}]$ up to a first-order Taylor approximation for any data-dependent miscoverage $\tilde{\alpha}$, and (ii) a novel leave-one-out estimator $\hat{\alpha}^{\rm LOO}$ of the marginal miscoverage $\mathbb{E}[\tilde{\alpha}]$ based on the calibration set, ensuring that the theoretical guarantees remain computable in practice. This approach is particularly useful in applications where large prediction sets are impractical such as medical diagnosis. We provide theoretical results and empirical evidence supporting the validity of our method, demonstrating that it maintains computable coverage guarantees while ensuring interpretable, well-controlled prediction set sizes.</description>

      <title>Time Reversal Symmetry for Efficient Robotic Manipulations in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is pervasive in robotics and has been widely exploited to improve sample efficiency in deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, existing approaches primarily focus on spatial symmetries, such as reflection, rotation, and translation, while largely neglecting temporal symmetries. To address this gap, we explore time reversal symmetry, a form of temporal symmetry commonly found in robotics tasks such as door opening and closing. We propose Time Reversal symmetry enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (TR-DRL), a framework that combines trajectory reversal augmentation and time reversal guided reward shaping to efficiently solve temporally symmetric tasks. Our method generates reversed transitions from fully reversible transitions, identified by a proposed dynamics-consistent filter, to augment the training data. For partially reversible transitions, we apply reward shaping to guide learning, according to successful trajectories from the reversed task. Extensive experiments on the Robosuite and MetaWorld benchmarks demonstrate that TR-DRL is effective in both single-task and multi-task settings, achieving higher sample efficiency and stronger final performance compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Steering Generative Models with Experimental Data for Protein Fitness Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein fitness optimization involves finding a protein sequence that maximizes desired quantitative properties in a combinatorially large design space of possible sequences. Recent advances in steering protein generative models (e.g., diffusion models and language models) with labeled data offer a promising approach. However, most previous studies have optimized surrogate rewards and/or utilized large amounts of labeled data for steering, making it unclear how well existing methods perform and compare to each other in real-world optimization campaigns where fitness is measured through low-throughput wet-lab assays. In this study, we explore fitness optimization using small amounts (hundreds) of labeled sequence-fitness pairs and comprehensively evaluate strategies such as classifier guidance and posterior sampling for guiding generation from different discrete diffusion models of protein sequences. We also demonstrate how guidance can be integrated into adaptive sequence selection akin to Thompson sampling in Bayesian optimization, showing that plug-and-play guidance strategies offer advantages over alternatives such as reinforcement learning with protein language models. Overall, we provide practical insights into how to effectively steer modern generative models for next-generation protein fitness optimization.</description>

      <title>gen2seg: Generative Models Enable Generalizable Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By pretraining to synthesize coherent images from perturbed inputs, generative models inherently learn to understand object boundaries and scene compositions. How can we repurpose these generative representations for general-purpose perceptual organization? We finetune Stable Diffusion and MAE (encoder+decoder) for category-agnostic instance segmentation using our instance coloring loss exclusively on a narrow set of object types (indoor furnishings and cars). Surprisingly, our models exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, accurately segmenting objects of types and styles unseen in finetuning (and in many cases, MAE's ImageNet-1K pretraining too). Our best-performing models closely approach the heavily supervised SAM when evaluated on unseen object types and styles, and outperform it when segmenting fine structures and ambiguous boundaries. In contrast, existing promptable segmentation architectures or discriminatively pretrained models fail to generalize. This suggests that generative models learn an inherent grouping mechanism that transfers across categories and domains, even without internet-scale pretraining. Code, pretrained models, and demos are available on our website.</description>

      <title>DanmakuTPPBench: A Multi-modal Benchmark for Temporal Point Process Modeling and Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce DanmakuTPPBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to advance multi-modal Temporal Point Process (TPP) modeling in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs). While TPPs have been widely studied for modeling temporal event sequences, existing datasets are predominantly unimodal, hindering progress in models that require joint reasoning over temporal, textual, and visual information. To address this gap, DanmakuTPPBench comprises two complementary components: (1) DanmakuTPP-Events, a novel dataset derived from the Bilibili video platform, where user-generated bullet comments (Danmaku) naturally form multi-modal events annotated with precise timestamps, rich textual content, and corresponding video frames; (2) DanmakuTPP-QA, a challenging question-answering dataset constructed via a novel multi-agent pipeline powered by state-of-the-art LLMs and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs), targeting complex temporal-textual-visual reasoning. We conduct extensive evaluations using both classical TPP models and recent MLLMs, revealing significant performance gaps and limitations in current methods' ability to model multi-modal event dynamics. Our benchmark establishes strong baselines and calls for further integration of TPP modeling into the multi-modal language modeling landscape.

      <title>Explaining Large Language Models with gSMILE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21657v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, LLaMA, and Claude achieve remarkable performance in text generation but remain opaque in their decision-making processes, limiting trust and accountability in high-stakes applications. We present gSMILE (generative SMILE), a model-agnostic, perturbation-based framework for token-level interpretability in LLMs. Extending the SMILE methodology, gSMILE uses controlled prompt perturbations, Wasserstein distance metrics, and weighted linear surrogates to identify input tokens with the most significant impact on the output. This process enables the generation of intuitive heatmaps that visually highlight influential tokens and reasoning paths. We evaluate gSMILE across leading LLMs (OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct, Meta's LLaMA 3.1 Instruct Turbo, and Anthropic's Claude 2.1) using attribution fidelity, attribution consistency, attribution stability, attribution faithfulness, and attribution accuracy as metrics. Results show that gSMILE delivers reliable human-aligned attributions, with Claude 2.1 excelling in attention fidelity and GPT-3.5 achieving the highest output consistency. These findings demonstrate gSMILE's ability to balance model performance and interpretability, enabling more transparent and trustworthy AI systems.</description>

      <title>Nearly Dimension-Independent Convergence of Mean-Field Black-Box Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that, given a mean-field location-scale variational family, black-box variational inference (BBVI) with the reparametrization gradient converges at a rate that is nearly independent of explicit dimension dependence. Specifically, for a $d$-dimensional strongly log-concave and log-smooth target, the number of iterations for BBVI with a sub-Gaussian family to obtain a solution $\epsilon$-close to the global optimum has a dimension dependence of $\mathrm{O}(\log d)$. This is a significant improvement over the $\mathrm{O}(d)$ dependence of full-rank location-scale families. For heavy-tailed families, we prove a weaker $\mathrm{O}(d^{2/k})$ dependence, where $k$ is the number of finite moments of the family. Additionally, if the Hessian of the target log-density is constant, the complexity is free of any explicit dimension dependence. We also prove that our bound on the gradient variance, which is key to our result, cannot be improved using only spectral bounds on the Hessian of the target log-density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The real world is messy and unstructured. Uncovering critical information often requires active, goal-driven exploration. It remains to be seen whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which recently emerged as a popular zero-shot tool in many difficult tasks, can operate effectively in such conditions. In this paper, we answer this question by introducing FlySearch, a 3D, outdoor, photorealistic environment for searching and navigating to objects in complex scenes. We define three sets of scenarios with varying difficulty and observe that state-of-the-art VLMs cannot reliably solve even the simplest exploration tasks, with the gap to human performance increasing as the tasks get harder. We identify a set of central causes, ranging from vision hallucination, through context misunderstanding, to task planning failures, and we show that some of them can be addressed by finetuning. We publicly release the benchmark, scenarios, and the underlying codebase.</description>

      <title>Infinity Parser: Layout Aware Reinforcement Learning for Scanned Document Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated parsing of scanned documents into richly structured, machine-readable formats remains a critical bottleneck in Document AI, as traditional multi-stage pipelines suffer from error propagation and limited adaptability to diverse layouts. We introduce layoutRL, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that trains models to be explicitly layout-aware by optimizing a composite reward of normalized edit distance, paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. Leveraging our newly released dataset, Infinity-Doc-55K, which combines 55K high-fidelity synthetic scanned document parsing data with expert-filtered real-world documents, we instantiate layoutRL in a vision-language-model-based parser called Infinity-Parser. Evaluated on English and Chinese benchmarks for OCR, table and formula extraction, and reading order detection, Infinity-Parser achieves new state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and structural fidelity, outpacing specialist pipelines and general-purpose vision-language models. We will publicly release our code and dataset to accelerate progress in robust document understanding.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual reasoning: an analysis of in-context emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale neural language models exhibit remarkable performance in in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason about the input context on the fly. This work studies in-context counterfactual reasoning in language models, that is, the ability to predict consequences of a hypothetical scenario. We focus on a well-defined, synthetic linear regression task that requires noise abduction. Accurate prediction is based on (1) inferring an unobserved latent concept and (2) copying contextual noise from factual observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual reasoning. Further, we enhance existing identifiability results and reduce counterfactual reasoning for a broad class of functions to a transformation on in-context observations. In Transformers, we find that self-attention, model depth and pre-training data diversity drive performance. Moreover, we provide mechanistic evidence that the latent concept is linearly represented in the residual stream and we introduce designated \textit{noise abduction heads} central to performing counterfactual reasoning. Lastly, our findings extend to counterfactual reasoning under SDE dynamics and reflect that Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our code is available under https://github.com/mrtzmllr/iccr.</description>

      <title>Model-based Implicit Neural Representation for sub-wavelength Radio Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of large antenna arrays at base stations has significantly improved the spatial resolution and localization accuracy of radio-localization methods. However, traditional signal processing techniques struggle in complex radio environments, particularly in scenarios dominated by non line of sight (NLoS) propagation paths, resulting in degraded localization accuracy. Recent developments in machine learning have facilitated the development of machine learning-assisted localization techniques, enhancing localization accuracy in complex radio environments. However, these methods often involve substantial computational complexity during both the training and inference phases. This work extends the well-established fingerprinting-based localization framework by simultaneously reducing its memory requirements and improving its accuracy. Specifically, a model-based neural network is used to learn the location-to-channel mapping, and then serves as a generative neural channel model. This generative model augments the fingerprinting comparison dictionary while reducing the memory requirements. The proposed method outperforms fingerprinting baselines by achieving sub-wavelength localization accuracy, even in complex static NLoS environments. Remarkably, it offers an improvement by several orders of magnitude in localization accuracy, while simultaneously reducing memory requirements by an order of magnitude compared to classical fingerprinting methods.</description>

      <title>ALINE: Joint Amortization for Bayesian Inference and Active Data Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many critical applications, from autonomous scientific discovery to personalized medicine, demand systems that can both strategically acquire the most informative data and instantaneously perform inference based upon it. While amortized methods for Bayesian inference and experimental design offer part of the solution, neither approach is optimal in the most general and challenging task, where new data needs to be collected for instant inference. To tackle this issue, we introduce the Amortized Active Learning and Inference Engine (ALINE), a unified framework for amortized Bayesian inference and active data acquisition. ALINE leverages a transformer architecture trained via reinforcement learning with a reward based on self-estimated information gain provided by its own integrated inference component. This allows it to strategically query informative data points while simultaneously refining its predictions. Moreover, ALINE can selectively direct its querying strategy towards specific subsets of model parameters or designated predictive tasks, optimizing for posterior estimation, data prediction, or a mixture thereof. Empirical results on regression-based active learning, classical Bayesian experimental design benchmarks, and a psychometric model with selectively targeted parameters demonstrate that ALINE delivers both instant and accurate inference along with efficient selection of informative points.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge in Astrophysical Observational Inversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08065v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge (DSB) models in the context of dynamical astrophysical systems, specifically tackling observational inverse prediction tasks within Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) for star formation. We introduce the Astro-DSB model, a variant of DSB with the pairwise domain assumption tailored for astrophysical dynamics. By investigating its learning process and prediction performance in both physically simulated data and in real observations (the Taurus B213 data), we present two main takeaways. First, from the astrophysical perspective, our proposed paired DSB method improves interpretability, learning efficiency, and prediction performance over conventional astrostatistical and other machine learning methods. Second, from the generative modeling perspective, probabilistic generative modeling reveals improvements over discriminative pixel-to-pixel modeling in Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) testing cases of physical simulations with unseen initial conditions and different dominant physical processes. Our study expands research into diffusion models beyond the traditional visual synthesis application and provides evidence of the models' learning abilities beyond pure data statistics, paving a path for future physics-aware generative models which can align dynamics between machine learning and real (astro)physical systems.</description>

      <title>ReVeal: Self-Evolving Code Agents via Reliable Self-Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, existing methods rely solely on outcome rewards, without explicitly optimizing verification or leveraging reliable signals from realistic environments, leading to unreliable self-verification and limited test-time scaling. To address this, we widen the verification-generation asymmetry by explicitly optimizing self-verification, making it a reliable driver of deeper test-time scaling. We introduce ReVeal, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that evolves code generation through self-verification and tool-based evaluation. ReVeal structures long-horizon reasoning as iterative generation-verification turns and incorporates TAPO for turn-level credit assignment, fostering the co-evolution of code and test generation. At inference, this strengthened self-verification enables the model to use self-constructed tests and tool feedback to continuously evolve code for 20+ turns on LiveCodeBench despite training on only three. It also significantly improves Pass@k, indicating stronger exploration that expands the reasoning boundaries of the base model. These findings highlight the promise of ReVeal as a scalable paradigm for RL training and test-time scaling, paving the way for more robust and autonomous AI agents.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Reconcile Knowledge Conflicts in Counterfactual Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to contain extensive world knowledge in their parameters, enabling impressive performance on many knowledge intensive tasks. However, when deployed in novel settings, LLMs often encounter situations where they must integrate parametric knowledge with new or unfamiliar information. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can combine knowledge in-context with their parametric knowledge through the lens of counterfactual reasoning. Through synthetic and real experiments in multi-hop reasoning problems, we show that LLMs generally struggle with counterfactual reasoning, often resorting to exclusively using their parametric knowledge. Moreover, we show that simple post-hoc finetuning can struggle to instill counterfactual reasoning ability -- often leading to degradation in stored parametric knowledge. Ultimately, our work reveals important limitations of current LLM's abilities to re-purpose parametric knowledge in novel settings.</description>

      <title>AICO: Feature Significance Tests for Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The opacity of many supervised learning algorithms remains a key challenge, hindering scientific discovery and limiting broader deployment--particularly in high-stakes domains. This paper develops model- and distribution-agnostic significance tests to assess the influence of input features in any regression or classification algorithm. Our method evaluates a feature's incremental contribution to model performance by masking its values across samples. Under the null hypothesis, the distribution of performance differences across a test set has a non-positive median. We construct a uniformly most powerful, randomized sign test for this median, yielding exact p-values for assessing feature significance and confidence intervals with exact coverage for estimating population-level feature importance. The approach requires minimal assumptions, avoids model retraining or auxiliary models, and remains computationally efficient even for large-scale, high-dimensional settings. Experiments on synthetic tasks validate its statistical and computational advantages, and applications to real-world data demonstrate its ability to inform high-stakes decisions with legal, economic, and regulatory implications.</description>

      <title>A surrogate model for topology optimisation of elastic structures via parametric autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A surrogate-based topology optimisation algorithm for linear elastic structures under parametric loads and boundary conditions is proposed. Instead of learning the parametric solution of the state (and adjoint) problems or the optimisation trajectory as a function of the iterations, the proposed approach devises a surrogate version of the entire optimisation pipeline. First, the method predicts a quasi-optimal topology for a given problem configuration as a surrogate model of high-fidelity topologies optimised with the homogenisation method. This is achieved by means of a feed-forward net learning the mapping between the input parameters characterising the system setup and a latent space determined by encoder/decoder blocks reducing the dimensionality of the parametric topology optimisation problem and reconstructing a high-dimensional representation of the topology. Then, the predicted topology is used as an educated initial guess for a computationally efficient algorithm penalising the intermediate values of the design variable, while enforcing the governing equations of the system. This step allows the method to correct potential errors introduced by the surrogate model, eliminate artifacts, and refine the design in order to produce topologies consistent with the underlying physics. Different architectures are proposed and the approximation and generalisation capabilities of the resulting models are numerically evaluated. The quasi-optimal topologies allow to outperform the high-fidelity optimiser by reducing the average number of optimisation iterations by $53\%$ while achieving discrepancies below $4\%$ in the optimal value of the objective functional, even in the challenging scenario of testing the model to extrapolate beyond the training and validation domain.</description>

      <title>Viability of perturbative expansion for quantum field theories on neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03810v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Network (NN) architectures that break statistical independence of parameters have been proposed as a new approach for simulating local quantum field theories (QFTs). In the infinite neuron number limit, single-layer NNs can exactly reproduce QFT results. This paper examines the viability of this architecture for perturbative calculations of local QFTs for finite neuron number $N$ using scalar $\phi^4$ theory in $d$ Euclidean dimensions as an example. We find that the renormalized $O(1/N)$ corrections to two- and four-point correlators yield perturbative series which are sensitive to the ultraviolet cut-off and therefore have a weak convergence. We propose a modification to the architecture to improve this convergence and discuss constraints on the parameters of the theory and the scaling of N which allow us to extract accurate field theory results.</description>

      <title>Sim2Dust: Mastering Dynamic Waypoint Tracking on Granular Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable autonomous navigation across the unstructured terrains of distant planetary surfaces is a critical enabler for future space exploration. However, the deployment of learning-based controllers is hindered by the inherent sim-to-real gap, particularly for the complex dynamics of wheel interactions with granular media. This work presents a complete sim-to-real framework for developing and validating robust control policies for dynamic waypoint tracking on such challenging surfaces. We leverage massively parallel simulation to train reinforcement learning agents across a vast distribution of procedurally generated environments with randomized physics. These policies are then transferred zero-shot to a physical wheeled rover operating in a lunar-analogue facility. Our experiments systematically compare multiple reinforcement learning algorithms and action smoothing filters to identify the most effective combinations for real-world deployment. Crucially, we provide strong empirical evidence that agents trained with procedural diversity achieve superior zero-shot performance compared to those trained on static scenarios. We also analyze the trade-offs of fine-tuning with high-fidelity particle physics, which offers minor gains in low-speed precision at a significant computational cost. Together, these contributions establish a validated workflow for creating reliable learning-based navigation systems, marking a substantial step towards deploying autonomous robots in the final frontier.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Decision-Making for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles. Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data, interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions, yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular, non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.</description>

      <title>Efficient Training-Free Online Routing for High-Volume Multi-LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) services imposes substantial deployment and computation costs on providers. LLM routing offers a cost-efficient solution by directing queries to the optimal LLM based on model and query features. However, existing works primarily focus on offline scenarios and struggle to adapt to online settings with high query volume and constrained token budgets. In this work, we introduce the first training-free algorithm for online routing scenarios. Our algorithm leverages approximate nearest neighbor search to efficiently estimate query features and performs a one-time optimization over a small set of initial queries to learn a routing strategy that guides future routing. We provide theoretical guarantees demonstrating that our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $1 - o(1)$ under natural assumptions, which is further validated by extensive experiments across 3 benchmark datasets and 8 baselines, showing an average improvement of 3.55$\times$ in overall performance, 1.85$\times$ in cost efficiency, and nearly 4.25$\times$ in throughput.

      <title>Shuffling Heuristic in Variational Inequalities: Establishing New Convergence Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational inequalities have gained significant attention in machine learning and optimization research. While stochastic methods for solving these problems typically assume independent data sampling, we investigate an alternative approach -- the shuffling heuristic. This strategy involves permuting the dataset before sequential processing, ensuring equal consideration of all data points. Despite its practical utility, theoretical guarantees for shuffling in variational inequalities remain unexplored. We address this gap by providing the first theoretical convergence estimates for shuffling methods in this context. Our analysis establishes rigorous bounds and convergence rates, extending the theoretical framework for this important class of algorithms. We validate our findings through extensive experiments on diverse benchmark variational inequality problems, demonstrating faster convergence of shuffling methods compared to independent sampling approaches.</description>

      <title>Understanding Reinforcement Learning for Model Training, and future directions with GRAPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a self-contained, from-scratch, exposition of key algorithms for instruction tuning of models: SFT, Rejection Sampling, REINFORCE, Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Explanations of these algorithms often assume prior knowledge, lack critical details, and/or are overly generalized and complex. Here, each method is discussed and developed step by step using simplified and explicit notation focused on LLMs, aiming to eliminate ambiguity and provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the concepts. By minimizing detours into the broader RL literature and connecting concepts to LLMs, we eliminate superfluous abstractions and reduce cognitive overhead. Following this exposition, we provide a literature review of new techniques and approaches beyond those detailed. Finally, new ideas for research and exploration in the form of GRAPE (Generalized Relative Advantage Policy Evolution) are presented.</description>

      <title>Generating Individual Travel Diaries Using Large Language Models Informed by Census and Land-Use Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a Large Language Model (LLM) scheme for generating individual travel diaries in agent-based transportation models. While traditional approaches rely on large quantities of proprietary household travel surveys, the method presented in this study generates personas stochastically from open-source American Community Survey (ACS) and Smart Location Database (SLD) data, then synthesizes diaries through direct prompting. This study features a novel one-to-cohort realism score: a composite of four metrics (Trip Count Score, Interval Score, Purpose Score, and Mode Score) validated against the Connecticut Statewide Transportation Study (CSTS) diaries, matched across demographic variables. The validation utilizes Jensen-Shannon Divergence to measure distributional similarities between generated and real diaries. When compared to diaries generated with classical methods (Negative Binomial for trip generation; Multinomial Logit for mode/purpose) calibrated on the validation set, LLM-generated diaries achieve comparable overall realism (LLM mean: 0.485 vs. 0.455). The LLM excels in determining trip purpose and demonstrates greater consistency (narrower realism score distribution), while classical models lead in numerical estimates of trip count and activity duration. Aggregate validation confirms the LLM's statistical representativeness (LLM mean: 0.612 vs. 0.435), demonstrating LLM's zero-shot viability and establishing a quantifiable metric of diary realism for future synthetic diary evaluation systems.</description>

      <title>Patent Language Model Pretraining with ModernBERT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based language models such as BERT have become foundational in NLP, yet their performance degrades in specialized domains like patents, which contain long, technical, and legally structured text. Prior approaches to patent NLP have primarily relied on fine-tuning general-purpose models or domain-adapted variants pretrained with limited data. In this work, we pretrain 3 domain-specific masked language models for patents, using the ModernBERT architecture and a curated corpus of over 60 million patent records. Our approach incorporates architectural optimizations, including FlashAttention, rotary embeddings, and GLU feed-forward layers. We evaluate our models on four downstream patent classification tasks. Our model, ModernBERT-base-PT, consistently outperforms the general-purpose ModernBERT baseline on three out of four datasets and achieves competitive performance with a baseline PatentBERT. Additional experiments with ModernBERT-base-VX and Mosaic-BERT-large demonstrate that scaling the model size and customizing the tokenizer further enhance performance on selected tasks. Notably, all ModernBERT variants retain substantially faster inference over - 3x that of PatentBERT - underscoring their suitability for time-sensitive applications. These results underscore the benefits of domain-specific pretraining and architectural improvements for patent-focused NLP tasks.</description>

      <title>The Narcissus Hypothesis: Descending to the Rung of Illusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17999v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern foundational models increasingly reflect not just world knowledge, but patterns of human preference embedded in their training data. We hypothesize that recursive alignment-via human feedback and model-generated corpora-induces a social desirability bias, nudging models to favor agreeable or flattering responses over objective reasoning. We refer to it as the Narcissus Hypothesis and test it across 31 models using standardized personality assessments and a novel Social Desirability Bias score. Results reveal a significant drift toward socially conforming traits, with profound implications for corpus integrity and the reliability of downstream inferences. We then offer a novel epistemological interpretation, tracing how recursive bias may collapse higher-order reasoning down Pearl's Ladder of Causality, culminating in what we refer to as the Rung of Illusion.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Path Planning in Correlated Obstacle Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Stochastic Correlated Obstacle Scene (SCOS) problem, a navigation setting with spatially correlated obstacles of uncertain blockage status, realistically constrained sensors that provide noisy readings and costly disambiguation. Modeling the spatial correlation with Gaussian Random Field (GRF), we develop Bayesian belief updates that refine blockage probabilities, and use the posteriors to reduce search space for efficiency. To find the optimal traversal policy, we propose a novel two-stage learning framework. An offline phase learns a robust base policy via optimistic policy iteration augmented with information bonus to encourage exploration in informative regions, followed by an online rollout policy with periodic base updates via a Bayesian mechanism for information adaptation. This framework supports both Monte Carlo point estimation and distributional reinforcement learning (RL) to learn full cost distributions, leading to stronger uncertainty quantification. We establish theoretical benefits of correlation-aware updating and convergence property under posterior sampling. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across varying obstacle densities, sensor capabilities demonstrate consistent performance gains over baselines. This framework addresses navigation challenges in environments with adversarial interruptions or clustered natural hazards.</description>

      <title>SpecExit: Accelerating Large Reasoning Model via Speculative Exit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models (LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy. However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements, reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of hidden states for efficient reasoning. Our code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/AngelSlim.</description>

      <title>LAMP-PRo: Label-aware Attention for Multi-label Prediction of DNA- and RNA-binding Proteins using Protein Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying DNA- (DBPs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is crucial for the understanding of cell function, molecular interactions as well as regulatory functions. Owing to their high similarity, most of the existing approaches face challenges in differentiating between DBPs and RBPs leading to high cross-prediction errors. Moreover, identifying proteins which bind to both DNA and RNA (DRBPs) is also quite a challenging task. In this regard, we propose a novel framework viz. LAMP-PRo which is based on pre-trained protein language model (PLM), attention mechanisms and multi-label learning to mitigate these issues. First, pre-trained PLM such ESM-2 is used for embedding the protein sequences followed by convolutional neural network (CNN). Subsequently multi-head self-attention mechanism is applied for the contextual information while label-aware attention is used to compute class-specific representations by attending to the sequence in a way that is tailored to each label (DBP, RBP and non-NABP) in a multi-label setup. We have also included a novel cross-label attention mechanism to explicitly capture dependencies between DNA- and RNA-binding proteins, enabling more accurate prediction of DRBP. Finally, a linear layer followed by a sigmoid function are used for the final prediction. Extensive experiments are carried out to compare LAMP-PRo with the existing methods wherein the proposed model shows consistent competent performance. Furthermore, we also provide visualization to showcase model interpretability, highlighting which parts of the sequence are most relevant for a predicted label. The original datasets are available at http://bliulab.net/iDRBP\_MMC and the codes are available at https://github.com/NimishaGhosh/LAMP-PRo.</description>

      <title>Fair Minimum Labeling: Efficient Temporal Network Activations for Reachability and Equity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Balancing resource efficiency and fairness is critical in networked systems that support modern learning applications. We introduce the Fair Minimum Labeling (FML) problem: the task of designing a minimum-cost temporal edge activation plan that ensures each group of nodes in a network has sufficient access to a designated target set, according to specified coverage requirements. FML captures key trade-offs in systems where edge activations incur resource costs and equitable access is essential, such as distributed data collection, update dissemination in edge-cloud systems, and fair service restoration in critical infrastructure. We show that FML is NP-hard and $\Omega(\log |V|)$-hard to approximate, where $V$ is the set of nodes, and we present probabilistic approximation algorithms that match this bound, achieving the best possible guarantee for the activation cost. We demonstrate the practical utility of FML in a fair multi-source data aggregation task for training a shared model. Empirical results show that FML enforces group-level fairness with substantially lower activation cost than baseline heuristics, underscoring its potential for building resource-efficient, equitable temporal reachability in learning-integrated networks.</description>

      <title>Beyond Pass@k: Breadth-Depth Metrics for Reasoning Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.</description>

      <title>Is Implicit Knowledge Enough for LLMs? A RAG Approach for Tree-based Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on information within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting with structured data like code files, another popular method, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment the model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best represent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data, particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a novel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a GitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each hierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a knowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using RAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the generated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable across both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the retriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and scalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing MoE Reinforcement Learning by Aligning Training and Inference Routers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing the capabilities of large language models. However, in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the routing mechanism often introduces instability, even leading to catastrophic RL training collapse. We analyze the training-inference consistency of MoE models and identify a notable discrepancy in routing behaviors between the two phases. Moreover, even under identical conditions, the routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated forward passes. To address this foundational inconsistency, we propose Rollout Routing Replay (R3), a method that records routing distributions from the inference engine and replays them during training. R3 significantly reduces training-inference policy KL divergence and mitigates extreme discrepancies without compromising training speed. Extensive experiments on various settings confirm that R3 succeeds in stabilizing RL training, preventing collapse and outperforming methods such as GSPO and TIS. We believe this work can offer a new solution for stabilizing RL in MoE models.</description>

      <title>Incomplete Multi-view Clustering via Hierarchical Semantic Alignment and Cooperative Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incomplete multi-view data, where certain views are entirely missing for some samples, poses significant challenges for traditional multi-view clustering methods. Existing deep incomplete multi-view clustering approaches often rely on static fusion strategies or two-stage pipelines, leading to suboptimal fusion results and error propagation issues. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel incomplete multi-view clustering framework based on Hierarchical Semantic Alignment and Cooperative Completion (HSACC). HSACC achieves robust cross-view fusion through a dual-level semantic space design. In the low-level semantic space, consistency alignment is ensured by maximizing mutual information across views. In the high-level semantic space, adaptive view weights are dynamically assigned based on the distributional affinity between individual views and an initial fused representation, followed by weighted fusion to generate a unified global representation. Additionally, HSACC implicitly recovers missing views by projecting aligned latent representations into high-dimensional semantic spaces and jointly optimizes reconstruction and clustering objectives, enabling cooperative learning of completion and clustering. Experimental results demonstrate that HSACC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the hierarchical alignment and dynamic weighting mechanisms, while parameter analysis confirms the model's robustness to hyperparameter variations.</description>

      <title>A novel Information-Driven Strategy for Optimal Regression Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Machine Learning (ML), a regression algorithm aims to minimize a loss function based on data. An assessment method in this context seeks to quantify the discrepancy between the optimal response for an input-output system and the estimate produced by a learned predictive model (the student). Evaluating the quality of a learned regressor remains challenging without access to the true data-generating mechanism, as no data-driven assessment method can ensure the achievability of global optimality. This work introduces the Information Teacher, a novel data-driven framework for evaluating regression algorithms with formal performance guarantees to assess global optimality. Our novel approach builds on estimating the Shannon mutual information (MI) between the input variables and the residuals and applies to a broad class of additive noise models. Through numerical experiments, we confirm that the Information Teacher is capable of detecting global optimality, which is aligned with the condition of zero estimation error with respect to the -- inaccessible, in practice -- true model, working as a surrogate measure of the ground truth assessment loss and offering a principled alternative to conventional empirical performance metrics.</description>

      <title>TeLLMe v2: An Efficient End-to-End Ternary LLM Prefill and Decode Accelerator with Table-Lookup Matmul on Edge FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the emergence of wearable devices and other embedded systems, deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge platforms has become an urgent need. However, this is challenging because of their high computational and memory demands. Although recent low-bit quantization methods (e.g., BitNet, DeepSeek) compress weights to as low as 1.58~bits with minimal accuracy loss, edge deployment is still constrained by limited on-chip resources, power budgets, and the often-neglected long latency of the prefill stage. We present \textbf{TeLLMe}, the first table-lookup-based ternary LLM accelerator for low-power edge FPGAs that fully supports both prefill and autoregressive decoding using 1.58-bit weights and 8-bit activations. TeLLMe incorporates several novel techniques, including (1) a table-lookup-based ternary matrix multiplication (TLMM) engine utilizing grouped activations and online precomputation for low resource utilization and high throughput; (2) a fine-grained analytic URAM-based weight buffer management scheme for efficient loading and compute engine access; (3) a streaming dataflow architecture that fuses floating-point element-wise operations with linear computations to hide latency; (4) a reversed-reordered prefill stage attention with fused attention operations for high memory efficiency; and (5) a resource-efficient specialized decoding stage attention. Under a 5~W power budget, TeLLMe delivers up to 25~tokens/s decoding throughput and 0.45--0.96~s time-to-first-token (TTFT) for 64--128 token prompts, marking a significant energy-efficiency advancement in LLM inference on edge FPGAs.</description>

      <title>Nondeterminism-Aware Optimistic Verification for Floating-Point Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks increasingly run on hardware outside the user's control (cloud GPUs, inference marketplaces). Yet ML-as-a-Service reveals little about what actually ran or whether returned outputs faithfully reflect the intended inputs. Users lack recourse against service downgrades (model swaps, quantization, graph rewrites, or discrepancies like altered ad embeddings). Verifying outputs is hard because floating-point(FP) execution on heterogeneous accelerators is inherently nondeterministic. Existing approaches are either impractical for real FP neural networks or reintroduce vendor trust. We present NAO: a Nondeterministic tolerance Aware Optimistic verification protocol that accepts outputs within principled operator-level acceptance regions rather than requiring bitwise equality. NAO combines two error models: (i) sound per-operator IEEE-754 worst-case bounds and (ii) tight empirical percentile profiles calibrated across hardware. Discrepancies trigger a Merkle-anchored, threshold-guided dispute game that recursively partitions the computation graph until one operator remains, where adjudication reduces to a lightweight theoretical-bound check or a small honest-majority vote against empirical thresholds. Unchallenged results finalize after a challenge window, without requiring trusted hardware or deterministic kernels. We implement NAO as a PyTorch-compatible runtime and a contract layer currently deployed on Ethereum Holesky testnet. The runtime instruments graphs, computes per-operator bounds, and runs unmodified vendor kernels in FP32 with negligible overhead (0.3% on Qwen3-8B). Across CNNs, Transformers and diffusion models on A100, H100, RTX6000, RTX4090, empirical thresholds are $10^2-10^3$ times tighter than theoretical bounds, and bound-aware adversarial attacks achieve 0% success. NAO reconciles scalability with verifiability for real-world heterogeneous ML compute.</description>

      <title>Disaster Management in the Era of Agentic AI Systems: A Vision for Collective Human-Machine Intelligence for Augmented Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The escalating frequency and severity of disasters routinely overwhelm traditional response capabilities, exposing critical vulnerability in disaster management. Current practices are hindered by fragmented data streams, siloed technologies, resource constraints, and the erosion of institutional memory, which collectively impede timely and effective decision making. This study introduces Disaster Copilot, a vision for a multi-agent artificial intelligence system designed to overcome these systemic challenges by unifying specialized AI tools within a collaborative framework. The proposed architecture utilizes a central orchestrator to coordinate diverse sub-agents, each specializing in critical domains such as predictive risk analytics, situational awareness, and impact assessment. By integrating multi-modal data, the system delivers a holistic, real-time operational picture and serve as the essential AI backbone required to advance Disaster Digital Twins from passive models to active, intelligent environments. Furthermore, it ensures functionality in resource-limited environments through on-device orchestration and incorporates mechanisms to capture institutional knowledge, mitigating the impact of staff turnover. We detail the system architecture and propose a three-phased roadmap emphasizing the parallel growth of technology, organizational capacity, and human-AI teaming. Disaster Copilot offers a transformative vision, fostering collective human-machine intelligence to build more adaptive, data-driven and resilient communities.</description>

      <title>From Reviews to Actionable Insights: An LLM-Based Approach for Attribute and Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research proposes a systematic, large language model (LLM) approach for extracting product and service attributes, features, and associated sentiments from customer reviews. Grounded in marketing theory, the framework distinguishes perceptual attributes from actionable features, producing interpretable and managerially actionable insights. We apply the methodology to 20,000 Yelp reviews of Starbucks stores and evaluate eight prompt variants on a random subset of reviews. Model performance is assessed through agreement with human annotations and predictive validity for customer ratings. Results show high consistency between LLMs and human coders and strong predictive validity, confirming the reliability of the approach. Human coders required a median of six minutes per review, whereas the LLM processed each in two seconds, delivering comparable insights at a scale unattainable through manual coding. Managerially, the analysis identifies attributes and features that most strongly influence customer satisfaction and their associated sentiments, enabling firms to pinpoint "joy points," address "pain points," and design targeted interventions. We demonstrate how structured review data can power an actionable marketing dashboard that tracks sentiment over time and across stores, benchmarks performance, and highlights high-leverage features for improvement. Simulations indicate that enhancing sentiment for key service features could yield 1-2% average revenue gains per store.</description>

      <title>Kernel-Based Nonparametric Tests For Shape Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) framework for nonparametric mean-variance optimization and inference on shape constraints of the optimal rule. We derive statistical properties of the sample estimator and provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, such as asymptotic consistency, a functional central limit theorem, and a finite-sample deviation bound that matches the Monte Carlo rate up to regularization. Building on these findings, we introduce a joint Wald-type statistic to test for shape constraints over finite grids. The approach comes with an efficient computational procedure based on a pivoted Cholesky factorization, facilitating scalability to large datasets. Empirical tests suggest favorably of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>SimBench: Benchmarking the Ability of Large Language Models to Simulate Human Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) simulations of human behavior have the potential to revolutionize the social and behavioral sciences, if and only if they faithfully reflect real human behaviors. Current evaluations are fragmented, based on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable results. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale, standardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By unifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to economic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the necessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM simulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have limited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly with model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased inference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off: instruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions but degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle when simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that simulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive reasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939). By making progress measurable, we aim to accelerate the development of more faithful LLM simulators.</description>

      <title>Glyph: Scaling Context Windows via Visual-Text Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for tasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning. However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs. In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal tasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at https://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph.</description>
