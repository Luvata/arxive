      <title>Privileged Contrastive Pretraining for Multimodal Affect Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affective Computing (AC) has made significant progress with the advent of deep learning, yet a persistent challenge remains: the reliable transfer of affective models from controlled laboratory settings (in-vitro) to uncontrolled real-world environments (in-vivo). To address this challenge we introduce the Privileged Contrastive Pretraining (PriCon) framework according to which models are first pretrained via supervised contrastive learning (SCL) and then act as teacher models within a Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) framework. PriCon both leverages privileged information during training and enhances the robustness of derived affect models via SCL. Experiments conducted on two benchmark affective corpora, RECOLA and AGAIN, demonstrate that models trained using PriCon consistently outperform LUPI and end to end models. Remarkably, in many cases, PriCon models achieve performance comparable to models trained with access to all modalities during both training and testing. The findings underscore the potential of PriCon as a paradigm towards further bridging the gap between in-vitro and in-vivo affective modelling, offering a scalable and practical solution for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>PILOT-C: Physics-Informed Low-Distortion Optimal Trajectory Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Location-aware devices continuously generate massive volumes of trajectory data, creating demand for efficient compression. Line simplification is a common solution but typically assumes 2D trajectories and ignores time synchronization and motion continuity. We propose PILOT-C, a novel trajectory compression framework that integrates frequency-domain physics modeling with error-bounded optimization. Unlike existing line simplification methods, PILOT-C supports trajectories in arbitrary dimensions, including 3D, by compressing each spatial axis independently. Evaluated on four real-world datasets, PILOT-C achieves superior performance across multiple dimensions. In terms of compression ratio, PILOT-C outperforms CISED-W, the current state-of-the-art SED-based line simplification algorithm, by an average of 19.2%. For trajectory fidelity, PILOT-C achieves an average of 32.6% reduction in error compared to CISED-W. Additionally, PILOT-C seamlessly extends to three-dimensional trajectories while maintaining the same computational complexity, achieving a 49% improvement in compression ratios over SQUISH-E, the most efficient line simplification algorithm on 3D datasets.</description>

      <title>CX-Mind: A Pioneering Multimodal Large Language Model for Interleaved Reasoning in Chest X-ray via Curriculum-Guided Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is one of the most widely used diagnostic modalities in clinical practice, encompassing a broad spectrum of diagnostic tasks. Recent advancements have seen the extensive application of reasoning-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical imaging to enhance diagnostic efficiency and interpretability. However, existing multimodal models predominantly rely on "one-time" diagnostic approaches, lacking verifiable supervision of the reasoning process. This leads to challenges in multi-task CXR diagnosis, including lengthy reasoning, sparse rewards, and frequent hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose CX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved "think-answer" reasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and verifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an instruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148 samples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points supervised by clinical reports. Optimization was conducted in two stages under the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework: initially stabilizing basic reasoning with closed-domain tasks, followed by transfer to open-domain diagnostics, incorporating rule-based conditional process rewards to bypass the need for pretrained reward models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CX-Mind significantly outperforms existing medical and general-domain MLLMs in visual understanding, text generation, and spatiotemporal alignment, achieving an average performance improvement of 25.1% over comparable CXR-specific models. On real-world clinical dataset (Rui-CXR), CX-Mind achieves a mean recall@1 across 14 diseases that substantially surpasses the second-best results, with multi-center expert evaluations further confirming its clinical utility across multiple dimensions.</description>

      <title>Latent Knowledge Scalpel: Precise and Massive Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often retain inaccurate or outdated information from pre-training, leading to incorrect predictions or biased outputs during inference. While existing model editing methods can address this challenge, they struggle with editing large amounts of factual information simultaneously and may compromise the general capabilities of the models. In this paper, our empirical study demonstrates that it is feasible to edit the internal representations of LLMs and replace the entities in a manner similar to editing natural language inputs. Based on this insight, we introduce the Latent Knowledge Scalpel (LKS), an LLM editor that manipulates the latent knowledge of specific entities via a lightweight hypernetwork to enable precise and large-scale editing. Experiments conducted on Llama-2 and Mistral show even with the number of simultaneous edits reaching 10,000, LKS effectively performs knowledge editing while preserving the general abilities of the edited LLMs. Code is available at: https://github.com/Linuxin-xxx/LKS.</description>

      <title>GlaBoost: A multimodal Structured Framework for Glaucoma Risk Stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early and accurate detection of glaucoma is critical to prevent irreversible vision loss. However, existing methods often rely on unimodal data and lack interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. In this paper, we present GlaBoost, a multimodal gradient boosting framework that integrates structured clinical features, fundus image embeddings, and expert-curated textual descriptions for glaucoma risk prediction. GlaBoost extracts high-level visual representations from retinal fundus photographs using a pretrained convolutional encoder and encodes free-text neuroretinal rim assessments using a transformer-based language model. These heterogeneous signals, combined with manually assessed risk scores and quantitative ophthalmic indicators, are fused into a unified feature space for classification via an enhanced XGBoost model. Experiments conducted on a real-world annotated dataset demonstrate that GlaBoost significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving a validation accuracy of 98.71%. Feature importance analysis reveals clinically consistent patterns, with cup-to-disc ratio, rim pallor, and specific textual embeddings contributing most to model decisions. GlaBoost offers a transparent and scalable solution for interpretable glaucoma diagnosis and can be extended to other ophthalmic disorders.</description>

      <title>LRTuckerRep: Low-rank Tucker Representation Model for Multi-dimensional Data Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-dimensional data completion is a critical problem in computational sciences, particularly in domains such as computer vision, signal processing, and scientific computing. Existing methods typically leverage either global low-rank approximations or local smoothness regularization, but each suffers from notable limitations: low-rank methods are computationally expensive and may disrupt intrinsic data structures, while smoothness-based approaches often require extensive manual parameter tuning and exhibit poor generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel Low-Rank Tucker Representation (LRTuckerRep) model that unifies global and local prior modeling within a Tucker decomposition. Specifically, LRTuckerRep encodes low rankness through a self-adaptive weighted nuclear norm on the factor matrices and a sparse Tucker core, while capturing smoothness via a parameter-free Laplacian-based regularization on the factor spaces. To efficiently solve the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, we develop two iterative algorithms with provable convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional image inpainting and traffic data imputation demonstrate that LRTuckerRep achieves superior completion accuracy and robustness under high missing rates compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>LLM-Prior: A Framework for Knowledge-Driven Prior Elicitation and Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The specification of prior distributions is fundamental in Bayesian inference, yet it remains a significant bottleneck. The prior elicitation process is often a manual, subjective, and unscalable task. We propose a novel framework which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and scale this process. We introduce \texttt{LLMPrior}, a principled operator that translates rich, unstructured contexts such as natural language descriptions, data or figures into valid, tractable probability distributions. We formalize this operator by architecturally coupling an LLM with an explicit, tractable generative model, such as a Gaussian Mixture Model (forming a LLM based Mixture Density Network), ensuring the resulting prior satisfies essential mathematical properties. We further extend this framework to multi-agent systems where Logarithmic Opinion Pooling is employed to aggregate prior distributions induced by decentralized knowledge. We present the federated prior aggregation algorithm, \texttt{Fed-LLMPrior}, for aggregating distributed, context-dependent priors in a manner robust to agent heterogeneity. This work provides the foundation for a new class of tools that can potentially lower the barrier to entry for sophisticated Bayesian modeling.</description>

      <title>Provably Near-Optimal Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning in Online Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces significant challenges in real-world deployments due to the sim-to-real gap, where policies trained in simulators often underperform in practice due to mismatches between training and deployment conditions. Distributionally robust RL addresses this issue by optimizing worst-case performance over an uncertainty set of environments and providing an optimized lower bound on deployment performance. However, existing studies typically assume access to either a generative model or offline datasets with broad coverage of the deployment environment -- assumptions that limit their practicality in unknown environments without prior knowledge. In this work, we study the more realistic and challenging setting of online distributionally robust RL, where the agent interacts only with a single unknown training environment while aiming to optimize its worst-case performance. We focus on general $f$-divergence-based uncertainty sets, including Chi-Square and KL divergence balls, and propose a computationally efficient algorithm with sublinear regret guarantees under minimal assumptions. Furthermore, we establish a minimax lower bound on regret of online learning, demonstrating the near-optimality of our approach. Extensive experiments across diverse environments further confirm the robustness and efficiency of our algorithm, validating our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>GTPO: Trajectory-Based Policy Optimization in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.</description>

      <title>U-PINet: End-to-End Hierarchical Physics-Informed Learning With Sparse Graph Coupling for 3D EM Scattering Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) scattering modeling is critical for radar remote sensing, however, its inherent complexity introduces significant computational challenges. Traditional numerical solvers offer high accuracy, but suffer from scalability issues and substantial computational costs. Pure data-driven deep learning approaches, while efficient, lack physical constraints embedding during training and require extensive labeled data, limiting their applicability and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a U-shaped Physics-Informed Network (U-PINet), the first fully deep-learning-based, physics-informed hierarchical framework for computational EM designed to ensure physical consistency while maximizing computational efficiency. Motivated by the hierarchical decomposition strategy in EM solvers and the inherent sparsity of local EM coupling, the U-PINet models the decomposition and coupling of near- and far-field interactions through a multiscale processing neural network architecture, while employing a physics-inspired sparse graph representation to efficiently model both self- and mutual- coupling among mesh elements of complex $3$-Dimensional (3D) objects. This principled approach enables end-to-end multiscale EM scattering modeling with improved efficiency, generalization, and physical consistency. Experimental results showcase that the U-PINet accurately predicts surface current distributions, achieving close agreement with traditional solver, while significantly reducing computational time and outperforming conventional deep learning baselines in both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, our evaluations on radar cross section prediction tasks confirm the feasibility of the U-PINet for downstream EM scattering applications.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Heat Flux Analysis of Tungsten Monoblock Divertor on EAST using Physics-Informed Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating heat flux in the nuclear fusion device EAST is a critically important task. Traditional scientific computing methods typically model this process using the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, FEM relies on grid-based sampling for computation, which is computationally inefficient and hard to perform real-time simulations during actual experiments. Inspired by artificial intelligence-powered scientific computing, this paper proposes a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to address this challenge, significantly accelerating the heat conduction estimation process while maintaining high accuracy. Specifically, given inputs of different materials, we first feed spatial coordinates and time stamps into the neural network, and compute boundary loss, initial condition loss, and physical loss based on the heat conduction equation. Additionally, we sample a small number of data points in a data-driven manner to better fit the specific heat conduction scenario, further enhancing the model's predictive capability. We conduct experiments under both uniform and non-uniform heating conditions on the top surface. Experimental results show that the proposed thermal conduction physics-informed neural network achieves accuracy comparable to the finite element method, while achieving $\times$40 times acceleration in computational efficiency. The dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenFusion.</description>

      <title>SoilNet: A Multimodal Multitask Model for Hierarchical Classification of Soil Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent advances in foundation models have improved the state of the art in many domains, some problems in empirical sciences could not benefit from this progress yet. Soil horizon classification, for instance, remains challenging because of its multimodal and multitask characteristics and a complex hierarchically structured label taxonomy. Accurate classification of soil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil health, which directly impacts agricultural productivity, food security, ecosystem stability and climate resilience. In this work, we propose $\textit{SoilNet}$ - a multimodal multitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized pipeline. Our approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first predict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates. Each segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological features. Finally, horizon labels are predicted based on the multimodal concatenated feature vector, leveraging a graph-based label representation to account for the complex hierarchical relationships among soil horizons. Our method is designed to address complex hierarchical classification, where the number of possible labels is very large, imbalanced and non-trivially structured. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world soil profile dataset. All code and experiments can be found in our repository: https://github.com/calgo-lab/BGR/</description>

      <title>Bernoulli-LoRA: A Theoretical Framework for Randomized Low-Rank Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a crucial approach for adapting large foundational models to specific tasks, particularly as model sizes continue to grow exponentially. Among PEFT methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (arXiv:2106.09685) stands out for its effectiveness and simplicity, expressing adaptations as a product of two low-rank matrices. While extensive empirical studies demonstrate LoRA's practical utility, theoretical understanding of such methods remains limited. Recent work on RAC-LoRA (arXiv:2410.08305) took initial steps toward rigorous analysis. In this work, we introduce Bernoulli-LoRA, a novel theoretical framework that unifies and extends existing LoRA approaches. Our method introduces a probabilistic Bernoulli mechanism for selecting which matrix to update. This approach encompasses and generalizes various existing update strategies while maintaining theoretical tractability. Under standard assumptions from non-convex optimization literature, we analyze several variants of our framework: Bernoulli-LoRA-GD, Bernoulli-LoRA-SGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-PAGE, Bernoulli-LoRA-MVR, Bernoulli-LoRA-QGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-MARINA, and Bernoulli-LoRA-EF21, establishing convergence guarantees for each variant. Additionally, we extend our analysis to convex non-smooth functions, providing convergence rates for both constant and adaptive (Polyak-type) stepsizes. Through extensive experiments on various tasks, we validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical efficacy of our approach. This work is a step toward developing theoretically grounded yet practically effective PEFT methods.</description>

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a widely used approach for blackbox optimization that leverages a Gaussian process (GP) model and an acquisition function to guide future sampling. While effective in low-dimensional settings, BO faces scalability challenges in high-dimensional spaces and with large number of function evaluations due to the computational complexity of GP models. In contrast, neural networks (NNs) offer better scalability and can model complex functions, which led to the development of NN-based BO approaches. However, these methods typically rely on estimating model uncertainty in NN prediction -- a process that is often computationally intensive and complex, particularly in high dimensions. To address these limitations, a novel method, called scalable neural network-based blackbox optimization (SNBO), is proposed that does not rely on model uncertainty estimation. Specifically, SNBO adds new samples using separate criteria for exploration and exploitation, while adaptively controlling the sampling region to ensure efficient optimization. SNBO is evaluated on a range of optimization problems spanning from 10 to 102 dimensions and compared against four state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. Across the majority of test problems, SNBO attains function values better than the best-performing baseline algorithm, while requiring 40-60% fewer function evaluations and reducing the runtime by at least an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>DP-NCB: Privacy Preserving Fair Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-armed bandit algorithms are fundamental tools for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, with widespread applications across domains such as clinical trials and personalized decision-making. As bandit algorithms are increasingly deployed in these socially sensitive settings, it becomes critical to protect user data privacy and ensure fair treatment across decision rounds. While prior work has independently addressed privacy and fairness in bandit settings, the question of whether both objectives can be achieved simultaneously has remained largely open. Existing privacy-preserving bandit algorithms typically optimize average regret, a utilitarian measure, whereas fairness-aware approaches focus on minimizing Nash regret, which penalizes inequitable reward distributions, but often disregard privacy concerns.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce Differentially Private Nash Confidence Bound (DP-NCB)-a novel and unified algorithmic framework that simultaneously ensures $\epsilon$-differential privacy and achieves order-optimal Nash regret, matching known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. The framework is sufficiently general to operate under both global and local differential privacy models, and is anytime, requiring no prior knowledge of the time horizon. We support our theoretical guarantees with simulations on synthetic bandit instances, showing that DP-NCB incurs substantially lower Nash regret than state-of-the-art baselines. Our results offer a principled foundation for designing bandit algorithms that are both privacy-preserving and fair, making them suitable for high-stakes, socially impactful applications.</description>

      <title>VAE-DNN: Energy-Efficient Trainable-by-Parts Surrogate Model For Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a trainable-by-parts surrogate model for solving forward and inverse parameterized nonlinear partial differential equations. Like several other surrogate and operator learning models, the proposed approach employs an encoder to reduce the high-dimensional input $y(\bm{x})$ to a lower-dimensional latent space, $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_y}$. Then, a fully connected neural network is used to map $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_y}$ to the latent space, $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_h}$, of the PDE solution $h(\bm{x},t)$. Finally, a decoder is utilized to reconstruct $h(\bm{x},t)$. The innovative aspect of our model is its ability to train its three components independently. This approach leads to a substantial decrease in both the time and energy required for training when compared to leading operator learning models such as FNO and DeepONet. The separable training is achieved by training the encoder as part of the variational autoencoder (VAE) for $y(\bm{x})$ and the decoder as part of the $h(\bm{x},t)$ VAE. We refer to this model as the VAE-DNN model. VAE-DNN is compared to the FNO and DeepONet models for obtaining forward and inverse solutions to the nonlinear diffusion equation governing groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer. Our findings indicate that VAE-DNN not only demonstrates greater efficiency but also delivers superior accuracy in both forward and inverse solutions compared to the FNO and DeepONet models.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Spectrum Demand Prediction: A Spatio-Temporal Framework with Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate spectrum demand prediction is crucial for informed spectrum allocation, effective regulatory planning, and fostering sustainable growth in modern wireless communication networks. It supports governmental efforts, particularly those led by the international telecommunication union (ITU), to establish fair spectrum allocation policies, improve auction mechanisms, and meet the requirements of emerging technologies such as advanced 5G, forthcoming 6G, and the internet of things (IoT). This paper presents an effective spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages crowdsourced user-side key performance indicators (KPIs) and regulatory datasets to model and forecast spectrum demand. The proposed methodology achieves superior prediction accuracy and cross-regional generalizability by incorporating advanced feature engineering, comprehensive correlation analysis, and transfer learning techniques. Unlike traditional ITU models, which are often constrained by arbitrary inputs and unrealistic assumptions, this approach exploits granular, data-driven insights to account for spatial and temporal variations in spectrum utilization. Comparative evaluations against ITU estimates, as the benchmark, underscore our framework's capability to deliver more realistic and actionable predictions. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our methodology, highlighting its potential as a robust approach for policymakers and regulatory bodies to enhance spectrum management and planning.</description>

      <title>Prediction-Oriented Subsampling from Data Streams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data is often generated in streams, with new observations arriving over time. A key challenge for learning models from data streams is capturing relevant information while keeping computational costs manageable. We explore intelligent data subsampling for offline learning, and argue for an information-theoretic method centred on reducing uncertainty in downstream predictions of interest. Empirically, we demonstrate that this prediction-oriented approach performs better than a previously proposed information-theoretic technique on two widely studied problems. At the same time, we highlight that reliably achieving strong performance in practice requires careful model design.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Sampling of Extreme-Scale Turbulence Datasets for Accurate and Efficient Spatiotemporal Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the end of Moore's law and Dennard scaling, efficient training increasingly requires rethinking data volume. Can we train better models with significantly less data via intelligent subsampling? To explore this, we develop SICKLE, a sparse intelligent curation framework for efficient learning, featuring a novel maximum entropy (MaxEnt) sampling approach, scalable training, and energy benchmarking. We compare MaxEnt with random and phase-space sampling on large direct numerical simulation (DNS) datasets of turbulence. Evaluating SICKLE at scale on Frontier, we show that subsampling as a preprocessing step can improve model accuracy and substantially lower energy consumption, with reductions of up to 38x observed in certain cases.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Target Zone Blood Glucose Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Managing physiological variables within clinically safe target zones is a central challenge in healthcare, particularly for chronic conditions such as Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Reinforcement learning (RL) offers promise for personalising treatment, but struggles with the delayed and heterogeneous effects of interventions. We propose a novel RL framework to study and support decision-making in T1DM technologies, such as automated insulin delivery. Our approach captures the complex temporal dynamics of treatment by unifying two control modalities: \textit{impulse control} for discrete, fast-acting interventions (e.g., insulin boluses), and \textit{switching control} for longer-acting treatments and regime shifts. The core of our method is a constrained Markov decision process augmented with physiological state features, enabling safe policy learning under clinical and resource constraints. The framework incorporates biologically realistic factors, including insulin decay, leading to policies that better reflect real-world therapeutic behaviour. While not intended for clinical deployment, this work establishes a foundation for future safe and temporally-aware RL in healthcare. We provide theoretical guarantees of convergence and demonstrate empirical improvements in a stylised T1DM control task, reducing blood glucose level violations from 22.4\% (state-of-the-art) to as low as 10.8\%.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Biophysical Models for Grape Phenology Prediction via Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of grape phenology is essential for timely vineyard management decisions, such as scheduling irrigation and fertilization, to maximize crop yield and quality. While traditional biophysical models calibrated on historical field data can be used for season-long predictions, they lack the precision required for fine-grained vineyard management. Deep learning methods are a compelling alternative but their performance is hindered by sparse phenology datasets, particularly at the cultivar level. We propose a hybrid modeling approach that combines multi-task learning with a recurrent neural network to parameterize a differentiable biophysical model. By using multi-task learning to predict the parameters of the biophysical model, our approach enables shared learning across cultivars while preserving biological structure, thereby improving the robustness and accuracy of predictions. Empirical evaluation using real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms both conventional biophysical models and baseline deep learning approaches in predicting phenological stages, as well as other crop state variables such as cold-hardiness and wheat yield.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate Explanations of Distance-Based Classifiers by Uncovering Latent Explanatory Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distance-based classifiers, such as k-nearest neighbors and support vector machines, continue to be a workhorse of machine learning, widely used in science and industry. In practice, to derive insights from these models, it is also important to ensure that their predictions are explainable. While the field of Explainable AI has supplied methods that are in principle applicable to any model, it has also emphasized the usefulness of latent structures (e.g. the sequence of layers in a neural network) to produce explanations. In this paper, we contribute by uncovering a hidden neural network structure in distance-based classifiers (consisting of linear detection units combined with nonlinear pooling layers) upon which Explainable AI techniques such as layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) become applicable. Through quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate the advantage of our novel explanation approach over several baselines. We also show the overall usefulness of explaining distance-based models through two practical use cases.</description>

      <title>Active Learning and Transfer Learning for Anomaly Detection in Time-Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the effectiveness of combining active learning and transfer learning for anomaly detection in cross-domain time-series data. Our results indicate that there is an interaction between clustering and active learning and in general the best performance is achieved using a single cluster (in other words when clustering is not applied). Also, we find that adding new samples to the training set using active learning does improve model performance but that in general, the rate of improvement is slower than the results reported in the literature suggest. We attribute this difference to an improved experimental design where distinct data samples are used for the sampling and testing pools. Finally, we assess the ceiling performance of transfer learning in combination with active learning across several datasets and find that performance does initially improve but eventually begins to tail off as more target points are selected for inclusion in training. This tail-off in performance may indicate that the active learning process is doing a good job of sequencing data points for selection, pushing the less useful points towards the end of the selection process and that this tail-off occurs when these less useful points are eventually added. Taken together our results indicate that active learning is effective but that the improvement in model performance follows a linear flat function concerning the number of points selected and labelled.</description>

      <title>Next Generation Equation-Free Multiscale Modelling of Crowd Dynamics via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bridging the microscopic and the macroscopic modelling scales in crowd dynamics constitutes an important, open challenge for systematic numerical analysis, optimization, and control. We propose a combined manifold and machine learning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent crowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The proposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation Equation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and multiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the mass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first step, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete microscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based on manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space into the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the corresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning reduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning techniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the crowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density profiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density distribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this "embed-&gt;learn in latent space-&gt;lift back to the ambient space" pipeline, we create an effective solution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution. For our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a corridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions. The numerical results demonstrate high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability, thus allowing for fast and accurate modelling/simulation of crowd dynamics from agent-based simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the capacity of transformers to learn algorithms involving their context while solely being trained using next token prediction. We set up Markov chains with random transition matrices and we train transformers to predict the next token. Matrices used during training and test are different and we show that there is a threshold in transformer size and in training set size above which the model is able to learn to estimate the transition probabilities from its context instead of memorizing the training patterns. Additionally, we show that more involved encoding of the states enables more robust prediction for Markov chains with structures different than those seen during training.</description>

      <title>FairPOT: Balancing AUC Performance and Fairness with Proportional Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness metrics utilizing the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) have gained increasing attention in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. In these domains, fairness is often evaluated over risk scores rather than binary outcomes, and a common challenge is that enforcing strict fairness can significantly degrade AUC performance. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Proportional Optimal Transport (FairPOT), a novel, model-agnostic post-processing framework that strategically aligns risk score distributions across different groups using optimal transport, but does so selectively by transforming a controllable proportion, i.e., the top-lambda quantile, of scores within the disadvantaged group. By varying lambda, our method allows for a tunable trade-off between reducing AUC disparities and maintaining overall AUC performance. Furthermore, we extend FairPOT to the partial AUC setting, enabling fairness interventions to concentrate on the highest-risk regions. Extensive experiments on synthetic, public, and clinical datasets show that FairPOT consistently outperforms existing post-processing techniques in both global and partial AUC scenarios, often achieving improved fairness with slight AUC degradation or even positive gains in utility. The computational efficiency and practical adaptability of FairPOT make it a promising solution for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>BubbleONet: A Physics-Informed Neural Operator for High-Frequency Bubble Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces BubbleONet, an operator learning model designed to map pressure profiles from an input function space to corresponding bubble radius responses. BubbleONet is built upon the physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet) framework, leveraging DeepONet's powerful universal approximation capabilities for operator learning alongside the robust physical fidelity provided by the physics-informed neural networks. To mitigate the inherent spectral bias in deep learning, BubbleONet integrates the Rowdy adaptive activation function, enabling improved representation of high-frequency features. The model is evaluated across various scenarios, including: (1) Rayleigh-Plesset equation based bubble dynamics with a single initial radius, (2) Keller-Miksis equation based bubble dynamics with a single initial radius, and (3) Keller-Miksis equation based bubble dynamics with multiple initial radii. Moreover, the performance of single-step versus two-step training techniques for BubbleONet is investigated. The results demonstrate that BubbleONet serves as a promising surrogate model for simulating bubble dynamics, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional numerical solvers.</description>

      <title>Dynamic User-controllable Privacy-preserving Few-shot Sensing Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User-controllable privacy is important in modern sensing systems, as privacy preferences can vary significantly from person to person and may evolve over time. This is especially relevant in devices equipped with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, such as smartphones and wearables, which continuously collect rich time-series data that can inadvertently expose sensitive user behaviors. While prior work has proposed privacy-preserving methods for sensor data, most rely on static, predefined privacy labels or require large quantities of private training data, limiting their adaptability and user agency. In this work, we introduce PrivCLIP, a dynamic, user-controllable, few-shot privacy-preserving sensing framework. PrivCLIP allows users to specify and modify their privacy preferences by categorizing activities as sensitive (black-listed), non-sensitive (white-listed), or neutral (gray-listed). Leveraging a multimodal contrastive learning approach, PrivCLIP aligns IMU sensor data with natural language activity descriptions in a shared embedding space, enabling few-shot detection of sensitive activities. When a privacy-sensitive activity is identified, the system uses a language-guided activity sanitizer and a motion generation module (IMU-GPT) to transform the original data into a privacy-compliant version that semantically resembles a non-sensitive activity. We evaluate PrivCLIP on multiple human activity recognition datasets and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of both privacy protection and data utility.</description>

      <title>Tensorized Clustered LoRA Merging for Multi-Task Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the success of the monolithic dense paradigm of large language models (LLMs), the LoRA adapters offer an efficient solution by fine-tuning small task-specific modules and merging them with the base model. However, in multi-task settings, merging LoRA adapters trained on heterogeneous sources frequently causes \textit{task interference}, degrading downstream performance. To address this, we propose a tensorized clustered LoRA (TC-LoRA) library targeting to address the task interference at the \textit{text-level} and \textit{parameter-level}. At the \textit{text-level}, we cluster the training samples in the embedding space to capture input-format similarities, then train a specialized LoRA adapter for each cluster. At the \textit{parameter-level}, we introduce a joint Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition that disentangles task-specific and shared factors across LoRA adapters. This joint factorization preserves essential knowledge while reducing cross-task interference. Extensive experiments on out-of-domain zero-shot and skill-composition tasks-including reasoning, question answering, and coding. Compared to strong SVD-based baselines, TC-LoRA achieves +1.4\% accuracy on Phi-3 and +2.3\% on Mistral-7B (+2.3\%), demonstrating the effectiveness of TC-LoRA in LLM adaptation.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Contrastive Learning for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm that allows multiple participants to train a shared model by exchanging model updates instead of their raw data. However, its performance is degraded compared to centralized approaches due to data heterogeneity across clients. While contrastive learning has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this, our theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental conflict: its asymptotic assumptions of an infinite number of negative samples are violated in finite-sample regime of federated learning. To address this issue, we introduce Decoupled Contrastive Learning for Federated Learning (DCFL), a novel framework that decouples the existing contrastive loss into two objectives. Decoupling the loss into its alignment and uniformity components enables the independent calibration of the attraction and repulsion forces without relying on the asymptotic assumptions. This strategy provides a contrastive learning method suitable for federated learning environments where each client has a small amount of data. Our experimental results show that DCFL achieves stronger alignment between positive samples and greater uniformity between negative samples compared to existing contrastive learning methods. Furthermore, experimental results on standard benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet, demonstrate that DCFL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art federated learning methods.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Survey of PyTorch vs TensorFlow for Deep Learning: Usability, Performance, and Deployment Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative survey of TensorFlow and PyTorch, the two leading deep learning frameworks, focusing on their usability, performance, and deployment trade-offs. We review each framework's programming paradigm and developer experience, contrasting TensorFlow's graph-based (now optionally eager) approach with PyTorch's dynamic, Pythonic style. We then compare model training speeds and inference performance across multiple tasks and data regimes, drawing on recent benchmarks and studies. Deployment flexibility is examined in depth - from TensorFlow's mature ecosystem (TensorFlow Lite for mobile/embedded, TensorFlow Serving, and JavaScript support) to PyTorch's newer production tools (TorchScript compilation, ONNX export, and TorchServe). We also survey ecosystem and community support, including library integrations, industry adoption, and research trends (e.g., PyTorch's dominance in recent research publications versus TensorFlow's broader tooling in enterprise). Applications in computer vision, natural language processing, and other domains are discussed to illustrate how each framework is used in practice. Finally, we outline future directions and open challenges in deep learning framework design, such as unifying eager and graph execution, improving cross-framework interoperability, and integrating compiler optimizations (XLA, JIT) for improved speed. Our findings indicate that while both frameworks are highly capable for state-of-the-art deep learning, they exhibit distinct trade-offs: PyTorch offers simplicity and flexibility favored in research, whereas TensorFlow provides a fuller production-ready ecosystem - understanding these trade-offs is key for practitioners selecting the appropriate tool. We include charts, code snippets, and more than 20 references to academic papers and official documentation to support this comparative analysis</description>

      <title>FeDaL: Federated Dataset Learning for Time Series Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataset-wise heterogeneity introduces significant domain biases that fundamentally degrade generalization on Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), yet this challenge remains underexplored. This paper rethink the development of TSFMs using the paradigm of federated learning. We propose a novel Federated Dataset Learning (FeDaL) approach to tackle heterogeneous time series by learning dataset-agnostic temporal representations. Specifically, the distributed architecture of federated learning is a nature solution to decompose heterogeneous TS datasets into shared generalized knowledge and preserved personalized knowledge. Moreover, based on the TSFM architecture, FeDaL explicitly mitigates both local and global biases by adding two complementary mechanisms: Domain Bias Elimination (DBE) and Global Bias Elimination (GBE). FeDaL`s cross-dataset generalization has been extensively evaluated in real-world datasets spanning eight tasks, including both representation learning and downstream time series analysis, against 54 baselines. We further analyze federated scaling behavior, showing how data volume, client count, and join rate affect model performance under decentralization.</description>

      <title>Quantum Temporal Fusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), proposed by Lim et al. [\textit{International Journal of Forecasting}, 2021], is a state-of-the-art attention-based deep neural network architecture specifically designed for multi-horizon time series forecasting. It has demonstrated significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks. In this work, we propose a Quantum Temporal Fusion Transformer (QTFT), a quantum-enhanced hybrid quantum-classical architecture that extends the capabilities of the classical TFT framework. Our results demonstrate that QTFT is successfully trained on the forecasting datasets and is capable of accurately predicting future values. In particular, our experimental results display that in certain test cases, the model outperforms its classical counterpart in terms of both training and test loss, while in the remaining cases, it achieves comparable performance. A key advantage of our approach lies in its foundation on a variational quantum algorithm, enabling implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices without strict requirements on the number of qubits or circuit depth.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning for Better Few Shot Prompting: An Empirical Comparison for Short Answer Grading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research to improve Automated Short Answer Grading has recently focused on Large Language Models (LLMs) with prompt engineering and no- or few-shot prompting to achieve best results. This is in contrast to the fine-tuning approach, which has historically required large-scale compute clusters inaccessible to most users. New closed-model approaches such as OpenAI's fine-tuning service promise results with as few as 100 examples, while methods using open weights such as quantized low-rank adaptive (QLORA) can be used to fine-tune models on consumer GPUs. We evaluate both of these fine-tuning methods, measuring their interaction with few-shot prompting for automated short answer grading (ASAG) with structured (JSON) outputs. Our results show that finetuning with small amounts of data has limited utility for Llama open-weight models, but that fine-tuning methods can outperform few-shot baseline instruction-tuned LLMs for OpenAI's closed models. While our evaluation set is limited, we find some evidence that the observed benefits of finetuning may be impacted by the domain subject matter. Lastly, we observed dramatic improvement with the LLama 3.1 8B-Instruct open-weight model by seeding the initial training examples with a significant amount of cheaply generated synthetic training data.</description>

      <title>FLAT: Latent-Driven Arbitrary-Target Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, yet most existing methods are limited by fixed-pattern or single-target triggers, making them inflexible and easier to detect. We propose FLAT (FL Arbitrary-Target Attack), a novel backdoor attack that leverages a latent-driven conditional autoencoder to generate diverse, target-specific triggers as needed. By introducing a latent code, FLAT enables the creation of visually adaptive and highly variable triggers, allowing attackers to select arbitrary targets without retraining and to evade conventional detection mechanisms. Our approach unifies attack success, stealth, and diversity within a single framework, introducing a new level of flexibility and sophistication to backdoor attacks in FL. Extensive experiments show that FLAT achieves high attack success and remains robust against advanced FL defenses. These results highlight the urgent need for new defense strategies to address latent-driven, multi-target backdoor threats in federated settings.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Fair Multi-View Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cluster analysis is a fundamental problem in data mining and machine learning. In recent years, multi-view clustering has attracted increasing attention due to its ability to integrate complementary information from multiple views. However, existing methods primarily focus on clustering performance, while fairness-a critical concern in human-centered applications-has been largely overlooked. Although recent studies have explored group fairness in multi-view clustering, most methods impose explicit regularization on cluster assignments, relying on the alignment between sensitive attributes and the underlying cluster structure. However, this assumption often fails in practice and can degrade clustering performance. In this paper, we propose an adversarial fair multi-view clustering (AFMVC) framework that integrates fairness learning into the representation learning process. Specifically, our method employs adversarial training to fundamentally remove sensitive attribute information from learned features, ensuring that the resulting cluster assignments are unaffected by it. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that aligning view-specific clustering assignments with a fairness-invariant consensus distribution via KL divergence preserves clustering consistency without significantly compromising fairness, thereby providing additional theoretical guarantees for our framework. Extensive experiments on data sets with fairness constraints demonstrate that AFMVC achieves superior fairness and competitive clustering performance compared to existing multi-view clustering and fairness-aware clustering methods.</description>

      <title>Model Inversion Attacks on Vision-Language Models: Do They Leak What They Learn?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model inversion (MI) attacks pose significant privacy risks by reconstructing private training data from trained neural networks. While prior works have focused on conventional unimodal DNNs, the vulnerability of vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct the first study to understand VLMs' vulnerability in leaking private visual training data. To tailored for VLMs' token-based generative nature, we propose a suite of novel token-based and sequence-based model inversion strategies. Particularly, we propose Token-based Model Inversion (TMI), Convergent Token-based Model Inversion (TMI-C), Sequence-based Model Inversion (SMI), and Sequence-based Model Inversion with Adaptive Token Weighting (SMI-AW). Through extensive experiments and user study on three state-of-the-art VLMs and multiple datasets, we demonstrate, for the first time, that VLMs are susceptible to training data leakage. The experiments show that our proposed sequence-based methods, particularly SMI-AW combined with a logit-maximization loss based on vocabulary representation, can achieve competitive reconstruction and outperform token-based methods in attack accuracy and visual similarity. Importantly, human evaluation of the reconstructed images yields an attack accuracy of 75.31\%, underscoring the severity of model inversion threats in VLMs. Notably we also demonstrate inversion attacks on the publicly released VLMs. Our study reveals the privacy vulnerability of VLMs as they become increasingly popular across many applications such as healthcare and finance.</description>

      <title>COPO: Consistency-Aware Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving tasks. Recently, the introduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging rule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions and guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across many replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses under a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or incorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to vanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for learning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization framework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome consistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs show high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives meaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and self-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we incorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances local advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic transitions between exploration and convergence throughout training. Our method introduces several key innovations in both reward design and optimization strategy. We validate its effectiveness through substantial performance gains on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, highlighting the proposed framework's robustness and general applicability.

      <title>Semi-Supervised Deep Domain Adaptation for Predicting Solar Power Across Different Locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate solar generation prediction is essential for proper estimation of renewable energy resources across diverse geographic locations. However, geographical and weather features vary from location to location which introduces domain shift - a major bottleneck to develop location-agnostic prediction model. As a result, a machine-learning model which can perform well to predict solar power in one location, may exhibit subpar performance in another location. Moreover, the lack of properly labeled data and storage issues make the task even more challenging. In order to address domain shift due to varying weather conditions across different meteorological regions, this paper presents a semi-supervised deep domain adaptation framework, allowing accurate predictions with minimal labeled data from the target location. Our approach involves training a deep convolutional neural network on a source location's data and adapting it to the target location using a source-free, teacher-student model configuration. The teacher-student model leverages consistency and cross-entropy loss for semi-supervised learning, ensuring effective adaptation without any source data requirement for prediction. With annotation of only $20 \%$ data in the target domain, our approach exhibits an improvement upto $11.36 \%$, $6.65 \%$, $4.92\%$ for California, Florida and New York as target domain, respectively in terms of accuracy in predictions with respect to non-adaptive approach.</description>

      <title>One Small Step with Fingerprints, One Giant Leap for De Novo Molecule Generation from Mass Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04180v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common approach to the de novo molecular generation problem from mass spectra involves a two-stage pipeline: (1) encoding mass spectra into molecular fingerprints, followed by (2) decoding these fingerprints into molecular structures. In our work, we adopt MIST as the encoder and MolForge as the decoder, leveraging pretraining to enhance performance. Notably, pretraining MolForge proves especially effective, enabling it to serve as a robust fingerprint-to-structure decoder. Additionally, instead of passing the probability of each bit in the fingerprint, thresholding the probabilities as a step function helps focus the decoder on the presence of substructures, improving recovery of accurate molecular structures even when the fingerprints predicted by MIST only moderately resembles the ground truth in terms of Tanimoto similarity. This combination of encoder and decoder results in a tenfold improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods, generating top-1 28% / top-10 36% of molecular structures correctly from mass spectra. We position this pipeline as a strong baseline for future research in de novo molecule elucidation from mass spectra.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Training via Stochastic Alternating Minimization with Trainable Step Sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The training of deep neural networks is inherently a nonconvex optimization problem, yet standard approaches such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) require simultaneous updates to all parameters, often leading to unstable convergence and high computational cost. To address these issues, we propose a novel method, Stochastic Alternating Minimization with Trainable Step Sizes (SAMT), which updates network parameters in an alternating manner by treating the weights of each layer as a block. By decomposing the overall optimization into sub-problems corresponding to different blocks, this block-wise alternating strategy reduces per-step computational overhead and enhances training stability in nonconvex settings. To fully leverage these benefits, inspired by meta-learning, we proposed a novel adaptive step size strategy to incorporate into the sub-problem solving steps of alternating updates. It supports different types of trainable step sizes, including but not limited to scalar, element-wise, row-wise, and column-wise, enabling adaptive step size selection tailored to each block via meta-learning. We further provide a theoretical convergence guarantee for the proposed algorithm, establishing its optimization soundness. Extensive experiments for multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SAMT achieves better generalization performance with fewer parameter updates compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness and potential in neural network optimization.</description>

      <title>Causal Reward Adjustment: Mitigating Reward Hacking in External Reasoning via Backdoor Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: External reasoning systems combine language models with process reward models (PRMs) to select high-quality reasoning paths for complex tasks such as mathematical problem solving. However, these systems are prone to reward hacking, where high-scoring but logically incorrect paths are assigned high scores by the PRMs, leading to incorrect answers. From a causal inference perspective, we attribute this phenomenon primarily to the presence of confounding semantic features. To address it, we propose Causal Reward Adjustment (CRA), a method that mitigates reward hacking by estimating the true reward of a reasoning path. CRA trains sparse autoencoders on the PRM's internal activations to recover interpretable features, then corrects confounding by using backdoor adjustment. Experiments on math solving datasets demonstrate that CRA mitigates reward hacking and improves final accuracy, without modifying the policy model or retraining PRM.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04225v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces symmetric divergences to behavior regularization policy optimization (BRPO) to establish a novel offline RL framework. Existing methods focus on asymmetric divergences such as KL to obtain analytic regularized policies and a practical minimization objective. We show that symmetric divergences do not permit an analytic policy as regularization and can incur numerical issues as loss. We tackle these challenges by the Taylor series of $f$-divergence. Specifically, we prove that an analytic policy can be obtained with a finite series. For loss, we observe that symmetric divergences can be decomposed into an asymmetry and a conditional symmetry term, Taylor-expanding the latter alleviates numerical issues. Summing together, we propose Symmetric $f$ Actor-Critic (S$f$-AC), the first practical BRPO algorithm with symmetric divergences. Experimental results on distribution approximation and MuJoCo verify that S$f$-AC performs competitively.</description>

      <title>Empowering Time Series Forecasting with LLM-Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) powered agents have emerged as effective planners for Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) systems. While most existing AutoML approaches focus on automating feature engineering and model architecture search, recent studies in time series forecasting suggest that lightweight models can often achieve state-of-the-art performance. This observation led us to explore improving data quality, rather than model architecture, as a potentially fruitful direction for AutoML on time series data. We propose DCATS, a Data-Centric Agent for Time Series. DCATS leverages metadata accompanying time series to clean data while optimizing forecasting performance. We evaluated DCATS using four time series forecasting models on a large-scale traffic volume forecasting dataset. Results demonstrate that DCATS achieves an average 6% error reduction across all tested models and time horizons, highlighting the potential of data-centric approaches in AutoML for time series forecasting.</description>

      <title>Automated ultrasound doppler angle estimation using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angle estimation is an important step in the Doppler ultrasound clinical workflow to measure blood velocity. It is widely recognized that incorrect angle estimation is a leading cause of error in Doppler-based blood velocity measurements. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for automated Doppler angle estimation. The approach was developed using 2100 human carotid ultrasound images including image augmentation. Five pre-trained models were used to extract images features, and these features were passed to a custom shallow network for Doppler angle estimation. Independently, measurements were obtained by a human observer reviewing the images for comparison. The mean absolute error (MAE) between the automated and manual angle estimates ranged from 3.9{\deg} to 9.4{\deg} for the models evaluated. Furthermore, the MAE for the best performing model was less than the acceptable clinical Doppler angle error threshold thus avoiding misclassification of normal velocity values as a stenosis. The results demonstrate potential for applying a deep-learning based technique for automated ultrasound Doppler angle estimation. Such a technique could potentially be implemented within the imaging software on commercial ultrasound scanners.</description>

      <title>T3Time: Tri-Modal Time Series Forecasting via Adaptive Multi-Head Alignment and Residual Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) seeks to model temporal dynamics among variables to predict future trends. Transformer-based models and large language models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and patterns. However, current methods often rely on rigid inductive biases, ignore intervariable interactions, or apply static fusion strategies that limit adaptability across forecast horizons. These limitations create bottlenecks in capturing nuanced, horizon-specific relationships in time-series data. To solve this problem, we propose T3Time, a novel trimodal framework consisting of time, spectral, and prompt branches, where the dedicated frequency encoding branch captures the periodic structures along with a gating mechanism that learns prioritization between temporal and spectral features based on the prediction horizon. We also proposed a mechanism which adaptively aggregates multiple cross-modal alignment heads by dynamically weighting the importance of each head based on the features. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average reduction of 3.28% in MSE and 2.29% in MAE. Furthermore, it shows strong generalization in few-shot learning settings: with 5% training data, we see a reduction in MSE and MAE by 4.13% and 1.91%, respectively; and with 10% data, by 3.62% and 1.98% on average.

      <title>A Visual Tool for Interactive Model Explanation using Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SAInT, a Python-based tool for visually exploring and understanding the behavior of Machine Learning (ML) models through integrated local and global sensitivity analysis. Our system supports Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflows by enabling users - both AI researchers and domain experts - to configure, train, evaluate, and explain models through an interactive graphical interface without programming. The tool automates model training and selection, provides global feature attribution using variance-based sensitivity analysis, and offers per-instance explanation via LIME and SHAP. We demonstrate the system on a classification task predicting survival on the Titanic dataset and show how sensitivity information can guide feature selection and data refinement.</description>

      <title>Mockingbird: How does LLM perform in general machine learning tasks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now being used with increasing frequency as chat bots, tasked with the summarizing information or generating text and code in accordance with user instructions. The rapid increase in reasoning capabilities and inference speed of LLMs has revealed their remarkable potential for applications extending beyond the domain of chat bots to general machine learning tasks. This work is conducted out of the curiosity about such potential. In this work, we propose a framework Mockingbird to adapt LLMs to general machine learning tasks and evaluate its performance and scalability on several general machine learning tasks. The core concept of this framework is instructing LLMs to role-play functions and reflect on its mistakes to improve itself. Our evaluation and analysis result shows that LLM-driven machine learning methods, such as Mockingbird, can achieve acceptable results on common machine learning tasks; however, solely reflecting on its own currently cannot outperform the effect of domain-specific documents and feedback from human experts.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Vision-Language Model Training with Reinforcement Learning in Synthetic Worlds for Real-World Success</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive multimodal agents must convert raw visual observations into coherent sequences of language-conditioned actions -- a capability that current vision-language models (VLMs) still lack. Earlier reinforcement-learning (RL) efforts could, in principle, endow VLMs with such skills, but they have seldom tested whether the learned behaviours generalize beyond their training simulators, and they depend either on brittle hyperparameter tuning or on dense-reward environments with low state variability. We introduce Vision-Language Decoupled Actor-Critic (VL-DAC), a lightweight, hyperparameter-free RL algorithm. VL-DAC applies PPO updates to action tokens while learning value only at the environment-step level: an arrangement, to our knowledge, not previously explored for large VLMs or LLMs. This simple decoupling removes unstable weighting terms and yields faster, more reliable convergence. Training a single VLM with VL-DAC in one inexpensive simulator at a time (MiniWorld, Gym-Cards, ALFWorld, or WebShop) already produces policies that generalize widely: +50\% relative on BALROG (game-centric agentic control), +5\% relative on the hardest part of VSI-Bench (spatial planning), and +2\% on VisualWebBench (web navigation), all without degrading general image understanding accuracy. These results provide the first evidence that a simple RL algorithm can train VLMs entirely in cheap synthetic worlds while delivering measurable gains on real-image agentic, spatial-reasoning, and web-navigation benchmarks.</description>

      <title>WSS-CL: Weight Saliency Soft-Guided Contrastive Learning for Efficient Machine Unlearning Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning, the efficient deletion of the impact of specific data in a trained model, remains a challenging problem. Current machine unlearning approaches that focus primarily on data-centric or weight-based strategies frequently encounter challenges in achieving precise unlearning, maintaining stability, and ensuring applicability across diverse domains. In this work, we introduce a new two-phase efficient machine unlearning method for image classification, in terms of weight saliency, leveraging weight saliency to focus the unlearning process on critical model parameters. Our method is called weight saliency soft-guided contrastive learning for efficient machine unlearning image classification (WSS-CL), which significantly narrows the performance gap with "exact" unlearning. First, the forgetting stage maximizes kullback-leibler divergence between output logits and aggregated pseudo-labels for efficient forgetting in logit space. Next, the adversarial fine-tuning stage introduces contrastive learning in a self-supervised manner. By using scaled feature representations, it maximizes the distance between the forgotten and retained data samples in the feature space, with the forgotten and the paired augmented samples acting as positive pairs, while the retained samples act as negative pairs in the contrastive loss computation. Experimental evaluations reveal that our proposed method yields much-improved unlearning efficacy with negligible performance loss compared to state-of-the-art approaches, indicative of its usability in supervised and self-supervised settings.</description>

      <title>Forgetting: A New Mechanism Towards Better Large Language Model Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04329v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) plays a critical role for pretrained large language models (LLMs), notably enhancing their capacity to acquire domain-specific knowledge while preserving or potentially augmenting their general-purpose capabilities. However, the efficacy of SFT hinges on data quality as well as data volume, otherwise it may result in limited performance gains or even degradation relative to the associated baselines. To mitigate such reliance, we suggest categorizing tokens within each corpus into two parts -- positive and negative tokens -- based on whether they are useful to improve model performance. Positive tokens can be trained in common ways, whereas negative tokens, which may lack essential semantics or be misleading, should be explicitly forgotten. Overall, the token categorization facilitate the model to learn less informative message, and the forgetting process shapes a knowledge boundary to guide the model on what information to learn more precisely. We conduct experiments on well-established benchmarks, finding that this forgetting mechanism not only improves overall model performance and also facilitate more diverse model responses.</description>

      <title>From Split to Share: Private Inference with Distributed Feature Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud-based Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) raises serious privacy concerns when handling sensitive client data. Existing Private Inference (PI) methods face a fundamental trade-off between privacy and efficiency: cryptographic approaches offer strong protection but incur high computational overhead, while efficient alternatives such as split inference expose intermediate features to inversion attacks. We propose PrivDFS, a new paradigm for private inference that replaces a single exposed representation with distributed feature sharing. PrivDFS partitions input features on the client into multiple balanced shares, which are distributed to non-colluding, non-communicating servers for independent partial inference. The client securely aggregates the servers' outputs to reconstruct the final prediction, ensuring that no single server observes sufficient information to compromise input privacy. To further strengthen privacy, we propose two key extensions: PrivDFS-AT, which uses adversarial training with a diffusion-based proxy attacker to enforce inversion-resistant feature partitioning, and PrivDFS-KD, which leverages user-specific keys to diversify partitioning policies and prevent query-based inversion generalization. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CelebA demonstrate that PrivDFS achieves privacy comparable to deep split inference while cutting client computation by up to 100 times with no accuracy loss, and that the extensions remain robust against both diffusion-based in-distribution and adaptive attacks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Marginal Stochastic Flow Matching for High-Dimensional Snapshot Data at Irregular Time Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the evolution of high-dimensional systems from limited snapshot observations at irregular time points poses a significant challenge in quantitative biology and related fields. Traditional approaches often rely on dimensionality reduction techniques, which can oversimplify the dynamics and fail to capture critical transient behaviors in non-equilibrium systems. We present Multi-Marginal Stochastic Flow Matching (MMSFM), a novel extension of simulation-free score and flow matching methods to the multi-marginal setting, enabling the alignment of high-dimensional data measured at non-equidistant time points without reducing dimensionality. The use of measure-valued splines enhances robustness to irregular snapshot timing, and score matching prevents overfitting in high-dimensional spaces. We validate our framework on several synthetic and benchmark datasets, including gene expression data collected at uneven time points and an image progression task, demonstrating the method's versatility.</description>

      <title>Continual Multiple Instance Learning for Hematologic Disease Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic environment of laboratories and clinics, with streams of data arriving on a daily basis, requires regular updates of trained machine learning models for consistent performance. Continual learning is supposed to help train models without catastrophic forgetting. However, state-of-the-art methods are ineffective for multiple instance learning (MIL), which is often used in single-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis (e.g., leukemia detection). Here, we propose the first continual learning method tailored specifically to MIL. Our method is rehearsal-based over a selection of single instances from various bags. We use a combination of the instance attention score and distance from the bag mean and class mean vectors to carefully select which samples and instances to store in exemplary sets from previous tasks, preserving the diversity of the data. Using the real-world input of one month of data from a leukemia laboratory, we study the effectiveness of our approach in a class incremental scenario, comparing it to well-known continual learning methods. We show that our method considerably outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing the first continual learning approach for MIL. This enables the adaptation of models to shifting data distributions over time, such as those caused by changes in disease occurrence or underlying genetic alterations.</description>

      <title>FlexQ: Efficient Post-training INT6 Quantization for LLM Serving via Algorithm-System Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance but entail significant memory and computational costs, restricting their practical deployment. While existing INT4/INT8 quantization reduces these costs, they often degrade accuracy or lack optimal efficiency. INT6 quantization offers a superior trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency, but lacks hardware support in modern GPUs, forcing emulation via higher-precision arithmetic units that limit acceleration.
  In this paper, we propose FlexQ, a novel post-training INT6 quantization framework combining algorithmic innovation with system-level optimizations. FlexQ employs uniform 6-bit weight quantization across all layers, with adaptive retention of 8-bit activations in layers identified through layer-wise sensitivity analysis. To maximize hardware efficiency, we develop a specialized high-performance GPU kernel supporting matrix multiplication for W6A6 and W6A8 representations via Binary Tensor Core (BTC) equivalents, effectively bypassing the lack of native INT6 tensor cores. Evaluations on LLaMA models show FlexQ maintains near-FP16 accuracy, with perplexity increases of no more than 0.05. The proposed kernel achieves an average 1.39$\times$ speedup over ABQ-LLM on LLaMA-2-70B linear layers. End-to-end, FlexQ delivers 1.33$\times$ inference acceleration and 1.21$\times$ memory savings over SmoothQuant. Code is released at https://github.com/FlyFoxPlayer/FlexQ.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Multimodal Maze: A Systematic Review on the Adoption of Explainability in Multimodal Attention-based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal learning has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, particularly with the integration of attention-based models, leading to significant performance gains across a variety of tasks. Parallel to this progress, the demand for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has spurred a growing body of research aimed at interpreting the complex decision-making processes of these models. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between January 2020 and early 2024 that focuses on the explainability of multimodal models. Framed within the broader goals of XAI, we examine the literature across multiple dimensions, including model architecture, modalities involved, explanation algorithms and evaluation methodologies. Our analysis reveals that the majority of studies are concentrated on vision-language and language-only models, with attention-based techniques being the most commonly employed for explanation. However, these methods often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of interactions between modalities, a challenge further compounded by the architectural heterogeneity across domains. Importantly, we find that evaluation methods for XAI in multimodal settings are largely non-systematic, lacking consistency, robustness, and consideration for modality-specific cognitive and contextual factors. Based on these findings, we provide a comprehensive set of recommendations aimed at promoting rigorous, transparent, and standardized evaluation and reporting practices in multimodal XAI research. Our goal is to support future research in more interpretable, accountable, and responsible mulitmodal AI systems, with explainability at their core.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose new randomized algorithms for estimating the two-to-infinity and one-to-two norms in a matrix-free setting, using only matrix-vector multiplications. Our methods are based on appropriate modifications of Hutchinson's diagonal estimator and its Hutch++ version. We provide oracle complexity bounds for both modifications. We further illustrate the practical utility of our algorithms for Jacobian-based regularization in deep neural network training on image classification tasks. We also demonstrate that our methodology can be applied to mitigate the effect of adversarial attacks in the domain of recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Cloud Model Characteristic Function Auto-Encoder: Integrating Cloud Model Theory with MMD Regularization for Enhanced Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Cloud Model Characteristic Function Auto-Encoder (CMCFAE), a novel generative model that integrates the cloud model into the Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (WAE) framework. By leveraging the characteristic functions of the cloud model to regularize the latent space, our approach enables more accurate modeling of complex data distributions. Unlike conventional methods that rely on a standard Gaussian prior and traditional divergence measures, our method employs a cloud model prior, providing a more flexible and realistic representation of the latent space, thus mitigating the homogenization observed in reconstructed samples. We derive the characteristic function of the cloud model and propose a corresponding regularizer within the WAE framework. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA demonstrate that CMCFAE outperforms existing models in terms of reconstruction quality, latent space structuring, and sample diversity. This work not only establishes a novel integration of cloud model theory with MMD-based regularization but also offers a promising new perspective for enhancing autoencoder-based generative models.</description>

      <title>Automatic LLM Red Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red teaming is critical for identifying vulnerabilities and building trust in current LLMs. However, current automated methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on brittle prompt templates or single-turn attacks, failing to capture the complex, interactive nature of real-world adversarial dialogues. We propose a novel paradigm: training an AI to strategically `break' another AI. By formalizing red teaming as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employing a hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, we effectively address the inherent sparse reward and long-horizon challenges. Our generative agent learns coherent, multi-turn attack strategies through a fine-grained, token-level harm reward, enabling it to uncover subtle vulnerabilities missed by existing baselines. This approach sets a new state-of-the-art, fundamentally reframing LLM red teaming as a dynamic, trajectory-based process (rather than a one-step test) essential for robust AI deployment.</description>

      <title>Small transformer architectures for task switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid progress seen in terms of large-scale generative AI is largely based on the attention mechanism. It is conversely non-trivial to conceive small-scale applications for which attention-based architectures outperform traditional approaches, such as multi-layer perceptrons or recurrent networks. We examine this problem in the context of 'task switching'. In this framework models work on ongoing token sequences with the current task being determined by stochastically interspersed control tokens. We show that standard transformers cannot solve a basic task switching reference model based on finite domain arithmetics which contains subtasks dedicated to increment / addition / reverse copy / context (IARC). We show that transformers, long short-term memory recurrent networks (LSTM), and plain multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) achieve similar, but only modest prediction accuracies. We enlarge our comparative study by including an extension of the standard transformer architecture to its non-translational invariant counterpart, the cisformer, and an alternative attention mechanism, extensive attention. A combination of the latter is found to be the only model able to achieve considerable performance levels, of around 95%. Our results indicate that the workings of attention can be understood better, and even improved, when comparing qualitatively different formulations in task-switching settings.</description>

      <title>CARD: Cache-Assisted Parallel Speculative Decoding for Efficient Large Language Model Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD), where an extra draft model first provides multiple draft tokens and the original target model then verifies these tokens in parallel, has shown great power for LLM inference acceleration. However, existing SD methods must adhere to the 'draft-then-verify' paradigm, which forces drafting and verification processes to execute sequentially during SD, resulting in inefficient inference performance and limiting the size of the draft model. Furthermore, once a single token in the candidate sequence is rejected during the drafting process, all subsequent candidate tokens must be discarded, leading to inefficient drafting. To address these challenges, we propose a cache-based parallel speculative decoding framework employing a 'query-and-correct' paradigm. Specifically, CARD decouples drafting and verification: the draft model generates candidate tokens to populate a shared cache, while the target model concurrently rectifies the draft model's generation direction. This effectively enables the target model to perform inference at speed approaching that of the draft model. Our approach achieves up to 4.83 speedup over vanilla decoding without requiring fine-tuning of either the draft or target models. Our code is available at https://github.com/hunzhizi/CARD.</description>

      <title>GFocal: A Global-Focal Neural Operator for Solving PDEs on Arbitrary Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based neural operators have emerged as promising surrogate solvers for partial differential equations, by leveraging the effectiveness of Transformers for capturing long-range dependencies and global correlations, profoundly proven in language modeling. However, existing methodologies overlook the coordinated learning of interdependencies between local physical details and global features, which are essential for tackling multiscale problems, preserving physical consistency and numerical stability in long-term rollouts, and accurately capturing transitional dynamics. In this work, we propose GFocal, a Transformer-based neural operator method that enforces simultaneous global and local feature learning and fusion. Global correlations and local features are harnessed through Nystr\"{o}m attention-based \textbf{g}lobal blocks and slices-based \textbf{focal} blocks to generate physics-aware tokens, subsequently modulated and integrated via convolution-based gating blocks, enabling dynamic fusion of multiscale information. GFocal achieves accurate modeling and prediction of physical features given arbitrary geometries and initial conditions. Experiments show that GFocal achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 15.2\% relative gain in five out of six benchmarks and also excels in industry-scale simulations such as aerodynamics simulation of automotives and airfoils.</description>

      <title>FedHiP: Heterogeneity-Invariant Personalized Federated Learning Through Closed-Form Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lately, Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a prevalent paradigm to deliver personalized models by collaboratively training while simultaneously adapting to each client's local applications. Existing PFL methods typically face a significant challenge due to the ubiquitous data heterogeneity (i.e., non-IID data) across clients, which severely hinders convergence and degrades performance. We identify that the root issue lies in the long-standing reliance on gradient-based updates, which are inherently sensitive to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue and bridge the research gap, in this paper, we propose a Heterogeneity-invariant Personalized Federated learning scheme, named FedHiP, through analytical (i.e., closed-form) solutions to avoid gradient-based updates. Specifically, we exploit the trend of self-supervised pre-training, leveraging a foundation model as a frozen backbone for gradient-free feature extraction. Following the feature extractor, we further develop an analytic classifier for gradient-free training. To support both collective generalization and individual personalization, our FedHiP scheme incorporates three phases: analytic local training, analytic global aggregation, and analytic local personalization. The closed-form solutions of our FedHiP scheme enable its ideal property of heterogeneity invariance, meaning that each personalized model remains identical regardless of how non-IID the data are distributed across all other clients. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our FedHiP scheme, outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines by at least 5.79%-20.97% in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Who cuts emissions, who turns up the heat? causal machine learning estimates of energy efficiency interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing domestic energy demand is central to climate mitigation and fuel poverty strategies, yet the impact of energy efficiency interventions is highly heterogeneous. Using a causal machine learning model trained on nationally representative data of the English housing stock, we estimate average and conditional treatment effects of wall insulation on gas consumption, focusing on distributional effects across energy burden subgroups. While interventions reduce gas demand on average (by as much as 19 percent), low energy burden groups achieve substantial savings, whereas those experiencing high energy burdens see little to no reduction. This pattern reflects a behaviourally-driven mechanism: households constrained by high costs-to-income ratios (e.g. more than 0.1) reallocate savings toward improved thermal comfort rather than lowering consumption. Far from wasteful, such responses represent rational adjustments in contexts of prior deprivation, with potential co-benefits for health and well-being. These findings call for a broader evaluation framework that accounts for both climate impacts and the equity implications of domestic energy policy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to emotion detection using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs). Unlike traditional unimodal techniques that rely on a single data type, we explore a multimodal framework integrating text, audio, and facial expressions. The proposed cGAN architecture is trained to generate synthetic emotion-rich data and improve classification accuracy across multiple modalities. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in emotion recognition performance compared to baseline models. This work highlights the potential of cGANs in enhancing human-computer interaction systems by enabling more nuanced emotional understanding.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Scoring for Machine Learning Classifier Error Impact Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common use of machine learning (ML) models is predicting the class of a sample. Object detection is an extension of classification that includes localization of the object via a bounding box within the sample. Classification, and by extension object detection, is typically evaluated by counting a prediction as incorrect if the predicted label does not match the ground truth label. This pass/fail scoring treats all misclassifications as equivalent. In many cases, class labels can be organized into a class taxonomy with a hierarchical structure to either reflect relationships among the data or operator valuation of misclassifications. When such a hierarchical structure exists, hierarchical scoring metrics can return the model performance of a given prediction related to the distance between the prediction and the ground truth label. Such metrics can be viewed as giving partial credit to predictions instead of pass/fail, enabling a finer-grained understanding of the impact of misclassifications. This work develops hierarchical scoring metrics varying in complexity that utilize scoring trees to encode relationships between class labels and produce metrics that reflect distance in the scoring tree. The scoring metrics are demonstrated on an abstract use case with scoring trees that represent three weighting strategies and evaluated by the kind of errors discouraged. Results demonstrate that these metrics capture errors with finer granularity and the scoring trees enable tuning. This work demonstrates an approach to evaluating ML performance that ranks models not only by how many errors are made but by the kind or impact of errors. Python implementations of the scoring metrics will be available in an open-source repository at time of publication.</description>

      <title>Causal Reflection with Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, they struggle with robust causal reasoning, often relying on spurious correlations and brittle patterns. Similarly, traditional Reinforcement Learning agents also lack causal understanding, optimizing for rewards without modeling why actions lead to outcomes. We introduce Causal Reflection, a framework that explicitly models causality as a dynamic function over state, action, time, and perturbation, enabling agents to reason about delayed and nonlinear effects. Additionally, we define a formal Reflect mechanism that identifies mismatches between predicted and observed outcomes and generates causal hypotheses to revise the agent's internal model. In this architecture, LLMs serve not as black-box reasoners, but as structured inference engines translating formal causal outputs into natural language explanations and counterfactuals. Our framework lays the theoretical groundwork for Causal Reflective agents that can adapt, self-correct, and communicate causal understanding in evolving environments.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Lightweight Multivariate Time-Series Classification through Symmetric Multi-Resolution Convolutional Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate time-series classification is pivotal in domains ranging from wearable sensing to biomedical monitoring. Despite recent advances, Transformer- and CNN-based models often remain computationally heavy, offer limited frequency diversity, and require extensive parameter budgets. We propose PRISM (Per-channel Resolution-Informed Symmetric Module), a convolutional-based feature extractor that applies symmetric finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters at multiple temporal scales, independently per channel. This multi-resolution, per-channel design yields highly frequency-selective embeddings without any inter-channel convolutions, greatly reducing model size and complexity. Across human-activity, sleep-stage and biomedical benchmarks, PRISM, paired with lightweight classification heads, matches or outperforms leading CNN and Transformer baselines, while using roughly an order of magnitude fewer parameters and FLOPs. By uniting classical signal processing insights with modern deep learning, PRISM offers an accurate, resource-efficient solution for multivariate time-series classification.</description>

      <title>Channel-Independent Federated Traffic Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, traffic prediction has achieved remarkable success and has become an integral component of intelligent transportation systems. However, traffic data is typically distributed among multiple data owners, and privacy constraints prevent the direct utilization of these isolated datasets for traffic prediction. Most existing federated traffic prediction methods focus on designing communication mechanisms that allow models to leverage information from other clients in order to improve prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, such approaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting transmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume of traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical, making the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address this challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for federated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP). Unlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client communication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate predictions using only local information. Based on the CIP, we further develop Fed-CI, an efficient federated learning framework, allowing each client to process its own data independently while effectively mitigating the information loss caused by the lack of direct data sharing among clients. Fed-CI significantly reduces communication overhead, accelerates the training process, and achieves state-of-the-art performance while complying with privacy regulations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that Fed-CI consistently outperforms existing methods across all datasets and federated settings. It achieves improvements of 8%, 14%, and 16% in RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, respectively, while also substantially reducing communication costs.</description>

      <title>Privacy Risk Predictions Based on Fundamental Understanding of Personal Data and an Evolving Threat Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is difficult for individuals and organizations to protect personal information without a fundamental understanding of relative privacy risks. By analyzing over 5,000 empirical identity theft and fraud cases, this research identifies which types of personal data are exposed, how frequently exposures occur, and what the consequences of those exposures are. We construct an Identity Ecosystem graph--a foundational, graph-based model in which nodes represent personally identifiable information (PII) attributes and edges represent empirical disclosure relationships between them (e.g., the probability that one PII attribute is exposed due to the exposure of another). Leveraging this graph structure, we develop a privacy risk prediction framework that uses graph theory and graph neural networks to estimate the likelihood of further disclosures when certain PII attributes are compromised. The results show that our approach effectively answers the core question: Can the disclosure of a given identity attribute possibly lead to the disclosure of another attribute?</description>

      <title>GraphProp: Training the Graph Foundation Models using Graph Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on training graph foundation models (GFMs) that have strong generalization ability in graph-level tasks such as graph classification. Effective GFM training requires capturing information consistent across different domains. We discover that graph structures provide more consistent cross-domain information compared to node features and graph labels. However, traditional GFMs primarily focus on transferring node features from various domains into a unified representation space but often lack structural cross-domain generalization. To address this, we introduce GraphProp, which emphasizes structural generalization. The training process of GraphProp consists of two main phases. First, we train a structural GFM by predicting graph invariants. Since graph invariants are properties of graphs that depend only on the abstract structure, not on particular labellings or drawings of the graph, this structural GFM has a strong ability to capture the abstract structural information and provide discriminative graph representations comparable across diverse domains. In the second phase, we use the representations given by the structural GFM as positional encodings to train a comprehensive GFM. This phase utilizes domain-specific node attributes and graph labels to further improve cross-domain node feature generalization. Our experiments demonstrate that GraphProp significantly outperforms the competitors in supervised learning and few-shot learning, especially in handling graphs without node attributes.</description>

      <title>Improved Training Strategies for Physics-Informed Neural Networks using Real Experimental Data in Aluminum Spot Welding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resistance spot welding is the dominant joining process for the body-in-white in the automotive industry, where the weld nugget diameter is the key quality metric. Its measurement requires destructive testing, limiting the potential for efficient quality control. Physics-informed neural networks were investigated as a promising tool to reconstruct internal process states from experimental data, enabling model-based and non-invasive quality assessment in aluminum spot welding. A major challenge is the integration of real-world data into the network due to competing optimization objectives. To address this, we introduce two novel training strategies. First, experimental losses for dynamic displacement and nugget diameter are progressively included using a fading-in function to prevent excessive optimization conflicts. We also implement a custom learning rate scheduler and early stopping based on a rolling window to counteract premature reduction due to increased loss magnitudes. Second, we introduce a conditional update of temperature-dependent material parameters via a look-up table, activated only after a loss threshold is reached to ensure physically meaningful temperatures. An axially symmetric two-dimensional model was selected to represent the welding process accurately while maintaining computational efficiency. To reduce computational burden, the training strategies and model components were first systematically evaluated in one dimension, enabling controlled analysis of loss design and contact models. The two-dimensional network predicts dynamic displacement and nugget growth within the experimental confidence interval, supports transferring welding stages from steel to aluminum, and demonstrates strong potential for fast, model-based quality control in industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Multitask Learning with Stochastic Interpolants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for learning maps between probability distributions that broadly generalizes the time dynamics of flow and diffusion models. To enable this, we generalize stochastic interpolants by replacing the scalar time variable with vectors, matrices, or linear operators, allowing us to bridge probability distributions across multiple dimensional spaces. This approach enables the construction of versatile generative models capable of fulfilling multiple tasks without task-specific training. Our operator-based interpolants not only provide a unifying theoretical perspective for existing generative models but also extend their capabilities. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the zero-shot efficacy of our method on conditional generation and inpainting, fine-tuning and posterior sampling, and multiscale modeling, suggesting its potential as a generic task-agnostic alternative to specialized models.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Cybersecurity with Semi-supervised Lifelong Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04610v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the brain's hierarchical processing and energy efficiency, this paper presents a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture for lifelong Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). The proposed system first employs an efficient static SNN to identify potential intrusions, which then activates an adaptive dynamic SNN responsible for classifying the specific attack type. Mimicking biological adaptation, the dynamic classifier utilizes Grow When Required (GWR)-inspired structural plasticity and a novel Adaptive Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (Ad-STDP) learning rule. These bio-plausible mechanisms enable the network to learn new threats incrementally while preserving existing knowledge. Tested on the UNSW-NB15 benchmark in a continual learning setting, the architecture demonstrates robust adaptation, reduced catastrophic forgetting, and achieves $85.3$\% overall accuracy. Furthermore, simulations using the Intel Lava framework confirm high operational sparsity, highlighting the potential for low-power deployment on neuromorphic hardware.</description>

      <title>CaPulse: Detecting Anomalies by Tuning in to the Causal Rhythms of Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection has garnered considerable attention across diverse domains. While existing methods often fail to capture the underlying mechanisms behind anomaly generation in time series data. In addition, time series anomaly detection often faces several data-related inherent challenges, i.e., label scarcity, data imbalance, and complex multi-periodicity. In this paper, we leverage causal tools and introduce a new causality-based framework, CaPulse, which tunes in to the underlying causal pulse of time series data to effectively detect anomalies. Concretely, we begin by building a structural causal model to decipher the generation processes behind anomalies. To tackle the challenges posed by the data, we propose Periodical Normalizing Flows with a novel mask mechanism and carefully designed periodical learners, creating a periodicity-aware, density-based anomaly detection approach. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that CaPulse consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving AUROC improvements of 3% to 17%, with enhanced interpretability.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Pretraining Framework for Link Prediction with Efficient Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link Prediction (LP) is a critical task in graph machine learning. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced LP performance recently, existing methods face key challenges including limited supervision from sparse connectivity, sensitivity to initialization, and poor generalization under distribution shifts. We explore pretraining as a solution to address these challenges. Unlike node classification, LP is inherently a pairwise task, which requires the integration of both node- and edge-level information. In this work, we present the first systematic study on the transferability of these distinct modules and propose a late fusion strategy to effectively combine their outputs for improved performance. To handle the diversity of pretraining data and avoid negative transfer, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that captures distinct patterns in separate experts, facilitating seamless application of the pretrained model on diverse downstream datasets. For fast adaptation, we develop a parameter-efficient tuning strategy that allows the pretrained model to adapt to unseen datasets with minimal computational overhead. Experiments on 16 datasets across two domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on low-resource link prediction while obtaining competitive results compared to end-to-end trained methods, with over 10,000x lower computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Perch 2.0: The Bittern Lesson for Bioacoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perch is a performant pre-trained model for bioacoustics. It was trained in supervised fashion, providing both off-the-shelf classification scores for thousands of vocalizing species as well as strong embeddings for transfer learning. In this new release, Perch 2.0, we expand from training exclusively on avian species to a large multi-taxa dataset. The model is trained with self-distillation using a prototype-learning classifier as well as a new source-prediction training criterion. Perch 2.0 obtains state-of-the-art performance on the BirdSet and BEANS benchmarks. It also outperforms specialized marine models on marine transfer learning tasks, despite having almost no marine training data. We present hypotheses as to why fine-grained species classification is a particularly robust pre-training task for bioacoustics.</description>

      <title>Robustly Learning Monotone Single-Index Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the basic problem of learning Single-Index Models with respect to the square loss under the Gaussian distribution in the presence of adversarial label noise. Our main contribution is the first computationally efficient algorithm for this learning task, achieving a constant factor approximation, that succeeds for the class of {\em all} monotone activations with bounded moment of order $2 + \zeta,$ for $\zeta &gt; 0.$ This class in particular includes all monotone Lipschitz functions and even discontinuous functions like (possibly biased) halfspaces. Prior work for the case of unknown activation either does not attain constant factor approximation or succeeds for a substantially smaller family of activations. The main conceptual novelty of our approach lies in developing an optimization framework that steps outside the boundaries of usual gradient methods and instead identifies a useful vector field to guide the algorithm updates by directly leveraging the problem structure, properties of Gaussian spaces, and regularity of monotone functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10925v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preliminary attempts at incorporating the critical role of astrocytes - cells that constitute more than 50\% of human brain cells - in brain-inspired neuromorphic computing remain in infancy. This paper seeks to delve deeper into various key aspects of neuron-synapse-astrocyte interactions to mimic self-attention mechanisms in Transformers. The cross-layer perspective explored in this work involves bioplausible modeling of Hebbian and presynaptic plasticities in neuron-astrocyte networks, incorporating effects of non-linearities and feedback along with algorithmic formulations to map the neuron-astrocyte computations to self-attention mechanism and evaluating the impact of incorporating bio-realistic effects from the machine learning application side. Our analysis on sentiment and image classification tasks (IMDB and CIFAR10 datasets) highlights the advantages of Astromorphic Transformers, offering improved accuracy and learning speed. Furthermore, the model demonstrates strong natural language generation capabilities on the WikiText-2 dataset, achieving better perplexity compared to conventional models, thus showcasing enhanced generalization and stability across diverse machine learning tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving human health and well-being requires an accurate and effective understanding of an individual's physical and mental state throughout daily life. To support this goal, we utilized smartphones, smartwatches, and sleep sensors to collect data passively and continuously for 24 hours a day, with minimal interference to participants' usual behavior, enabling us to gather quantitative data on daily behaviors and sleep activities across multiple days. Additionally, we gathered subjective self-reports of participants' fatigue, stress, and sleep quality through surveys conducted immediately before and after sleep. This comprehensive lifelog dataset is expected to provide a foundational resource for exploring meaningful insights into human daily life and lifestyle patterns, and a portion of the data has been anonymized and made publicly available for further research. In this paper, we introduce the ETRI Lifelog Dataset 2024, detailing its structure and presenting potential applications, such as using machine learning models to predict sleep quality and stress.</description>

      <title>Suggest, Complement, Inspire: Story of Two Tower Recommendations at Allegro.com</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building large-scale e-commerce recommendation systems requires addressing three key technical challenges: (1) designing a universal recommendation architecture across dozens of placements, (2) decreasing excessive maintenance costs, and (3) managing a highly dynamic product catalogue. This paper presents a unified content-based recommendation system deployed at Allegro.com, the largest e-commerce platform of European origin. The system is built on a prevalent Two Tower retrieval framework, representing products using textual and structured attributes, which enables efficient retrieval via Approximate Nearest Neighbour search. We demonstrate how the same model architecture can be adapted to serve three distinct recommendation tasks: similarity search, complementary product suggestions, and inspirational content discovery, by modifying only a handful of components in either the model or the serving logic. Extensive A/B testing over two years confirms significant gains in engagement and profit-based metrics across desktop and mobile app channels. Our results show that a flexible, scalable architecture can serve diverse user intents with minimal maintenance overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful approach for modelling molecular systems, but it remains computationally intensive on spatial and time scales of many macromolecular systems of biological interest. To explore the opportunities offered by deep learning to address this problem, we introduce a Molecular Dynamics Large Language Model (MD-LLM) framework to illustrate how LLMs can be leveraged to learn protein dynamics and discover states not seen in training. By applying MD-LLM-1, the first implementation of this approach, obtained by fine-tuning Mistral 7B, to the T4 lysozyme and Mad2 protein systems, we show that training on one conformational state enables the prediction of other conformational states. These results indicate that MD-LLM-1 can learn the principles for the exploration of the conformational landscapes of proteins, although it is not yet modeling explicitly their thermodynamics and kinetics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Generative AI tools have become increasingly relevant in supporting personalized recommendations across various domains. However, their effectiveness in health-related behavioral interventions, especially those aiming to reduce the use of technology, remains underexplored. Aims: This study evaluates the performance and user satisfaction of the five most widely used generative AI tools when recommending non-digital activities tailored to individuals at risk of repetitive strain injury. Method: Following the Goal/Question/Metric (GQM) paradigm, this proposed experiment involves generative AI tools that suggest offline activities based on predefined user profiles and intervention scenarios. The evaluation is focused on quantitative performance (precision, recall, F1-score and MCC-score) and qualitative aspects (user satisfaction and perceived recommendation relevance). Two research questions were defined: RQ1 assessed which tool delivers the most accurate recommendations, and RQ2 evaluated how tool choice influences user satisfaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have become deeply embedded in our everyday life, offering a dynamic stream of localized news and personal experiences. The ubiquity of these platforms position them as valuable resources for identifying estate-related issues, especially in the context of growing urban populations. In this work, we present a language model-based system for the detection and classification of estate-related events from social media content. Our system employs a hierarchical classification framework to first filter relevant posts and then categorize them into actionable estate-related topics. Additionally, for posts lacking explicit geotags, we apply a transformer-based geolocation module to infer posting locations at the point-of-interest level. This integrated approach supports timely, data-driven insights for urban management, operational response and situational awareness.</description>

      <title>Detection of Autonomic Dysreflexia in Individuals With Spinal Cord Injury Using Multimodal Wearable Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by sudden, severe blood pressure (BP) spikes in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Early, accurate detection is essential to prevent cardiovascular complications, yet current monitoring methods are either invasive or rely on subjective symptom reporting, limiting applicability in daily file. This study presents a non-invasive, explainable machine learning framework for detecting AD using multimodal wearable sensors. Data were collected from 27 individuals with chronic SCI during urodynamic studies, including electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), bioimpedance (BioZ), temperature, respiratory rate (RR), and heart rate (HR), across three commercial devices. Objective AD labels were derived from synchronized cuff-based BP measurements. Following signal preprocessing and feature extraction, BorutaSHAP was used for robust feature selection, and SHAP values for explainability. We trained modality- and device-specific weak learners and aggregated them using a stacked ensemble meta-model. Cross-validation was stratified by participants to ensure generalizability. HR- and ECG-derived features were identified as the most informative, particularly those capturing rhythm morphology and variability. The Nearest Centroid ensemble yielded the highest performance (Macro F1 = 0.77+/-0.03), significantly outperforming baseline models. Among modalities, HR achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC = 0.93), followed by ECG (0.88) and PPG (0.86). RR and temperature features contributed less to overall accuracy, consistent with missing data and low specificity. The model proved robust to sensor dropout and aligned well with clinical AD events. These results represent an important step toward personalized, real-time monitoring for individuals with SCI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present specialized Large Language Models for theoretical High-Energy Physics, obtained as 20 fine-tuned variants of the 8-billion parameter Llama-3.1 model. Each variant was trained on arXiv abstracts (through August 2024) from different combinations of hep-th, hep-ph and gr-qc. For a comparative study, we also trained models on datasets that contained abstracts from disparate fields such as the q-bio and cs categories. All models were fine-tuned using two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning approaches and varying dataset sizes, and outperformed the base model on hep-th abstract completion tasks. We compare performance against leading commercial LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek) and derive insights for further developing specialized language models for High-Energy Theoretical Physics.</description>

Abstract: U.S. health insurance is complex, and inadequate understanding and limited access to justice have dire implications for the most vulnerable. Advances in natural language processing present an opportunity to support efficient, case-specific understanding, and to improve access to justice and healthcare. Yet existing corpora lack context necessary for assessing even simple cases. We collect and release a corpus of reputable legal and medical text related to U.S. health insurance. We also introduce an outcome prediction task for health insurance appeals designed to support regulatory and patient self-help applications, and release a labeled benchmark for our task, and models trained on it.</description>

      <title>Boosting Vision Semantic Density with Anatomy Normality Modeling for Medical Vision-language Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) has great potential for developing multifunctional and general medical diagnostic capabilities. However, aligning medical images with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to reports with a high SNR presents a semantic density gap, leading to visual alignment bias. In this paper, we propose boosting vision semantic density to improve alignment effectiveness. On one hand, we enhance visual semantics through disease-level vision contrastive learning, which strengthens the model's ability to differentiate between normal and abnormal samples for each anatomical structure. On the other hand, we introduce an anatomical normality modeling method to model the distribution of normal samples for each anatomy, leveraging VQ-VAE for reconstructing normal vision embeddings in the latent space. This process amplifies abnormal signals by leveraging distribution shifts in abnormal samples, enhancing the model's perception and discrimination of abnormal attributes. The enhanced visual representation effectively captures the diagnostic-relevant semantics, facilitating more efficient and accurate alignment with the diagnostic report. We conduct extensive experiments on two chest CT datasets, CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT, and an abdominal CT dataset, MedVL-CT69K, and comprehensively evaluate the diagnosis performance across multiple tasks in the chest and abdominal CT scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Notably, our method achieved an average AUC of 84.9% across 54 diseases in 15 organs, significantly surpassing existing methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the superior transfer learning capabilities of our pre-trained model. Code is available at https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/ViSD-Boost.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Discovery of Mobility Periodicity for Understanding Urban Transportation Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncovering the temporal regularity of human mobility is crucial for discovering urban dynamics and has implications for various decision-making processes and urban system applications. This study formulates the periodicity quantification problem in complex and multidimensional human mobility data as a sparse identification of dominant positive auto-correlations in time series autoregression, allowing one to discover and quantify significant periodic patterns such as weekly periodicity from a data-driven and interpretable machine learning perspective. We apply our framework to real-world human mobility data, including metro passenger flow in Hangzhou, China and ridesharing trips in New York City (NYC) and Chicago, USA, revealing the interpretable weekly periodicity across different spatial locations over past several years. In particular, our analysis of ridesharing data from 2019 to 2024 demonstrates the disruptive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mobility regularity and the subsequent recovery trends, highlighting differences in the recovery pattern percentages and speeds between NYC and Chicago. We explore that both NYC and Chicago experienced a remarkable reduction of weekly periodicity in 2020, and the recovery of mobility regularity in NYC is faster than Chicago. The interpretability of sparse autoregression provides insights into the underlying temporal patterns of human mobility, offering a valuable tool for understanding urban systems. Our findings highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning to unlock crucial insights from real-world mobility data.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates fall risk prediction in older adults using various machine learning models trained on accelerometric, non-accelerometric, and combined data from 146 participants. Models combining both data types achieved superior performance, with Bayesian Ridge Regression showing the highest accuracy (MSE = 0.6746, R2 = 0.9941). Non-accelerometric variables, such as age and comorbidities, proved critical for prediction. Results support the use of integrated data and Bayesian approaches to enhance fall risk assessment and inform prevention strategies.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Impact of Image Super Resolution on White Blood Cell Classification Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately classifying white blood cells from microscopic images is essential to identify several illnesses and conditions in medical diagnostics. Many deep learning technologies are being employed to quickly and automatically classify images. However, most of the time, the resolution of these microscopic pictures is quite low, which might make it difficult to classify them correctly. Some picture improvement techniques, such as image super-resolution, are being utilized to improve the resolution of the photos to get around this issue. The suggested study uses large image dimension upscaling to investigate how picture-enhancing approaches affect classification performance. The study specifically looks at how deep learning models may be able to understand more complex visual information by capturing subtler morphological changes when image resolution is increased using cutting-edge techniques. The model may learn from standard and augmented data since the improved images are incorporated into the training process. This dual method seeks to comprehend the impact of image resolution on model performance and enhance classification accuracy. A well-known model for picture categorization is used to conduct extensive testing and thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of this approach. This research intends to create more efficient image identification algorithms customized to a particular dataset of white blood cells by understanding the trade-offs between ordinary and enhanced images.</description>

      <title>A Robust and Efficient Pipeline for Enterprise-Level Large-Scale Entity Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entity resolution (ER) remains a significant challenge in data management, especially when dealing with large datasets. This paper introduces MERAI (Massive Entity Resolution using AI), a robust and efficient pipeline designed to address record deduplication and linkage issues in high-volume datasets at an enterprise level. The pipeline's resilience and accuracy have been validated through various large-scale record deduplication and linkage projects. To evaluate MERAI's performance, we compared it with two well-known entity resolution libraries, Dedupe and Splink. While Dedupe failed to scale beyond 2 million records due to memory constraints, MERAI successfully processed datasets of up to 15.7 million records and produced accurate results across all experiments. Experimental data demonstrates that MERAI outperforms both baseline systems in terms of matching accuracy, with consistently higher F1 scores in both deduplication and record linkage tasks. MERAI offers a scalable and reliable solution for enterprise-level large-scale entity resolution, ensuring data integrity and consistency in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Development of management systems using artificial intelligence systems and machine learning methods for boards of directors (preprint, unofficial translation)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study addresses the paradigm shift in corporate management, where AI is moving from a decision support tool to an autonomous decision-maker, with some AI systems already appointed to leadership roles in companies. A central problem identified is that the development of AI technologies is far outpacing the creation of adequate legal and ethical guidelines.
  The research proposes a "reference model" for the development and implementation of autonomous AI systems in corporate management. This model is based on a synthesis of several key components to ensure legitimate and ethical decision-making. The model introduces the concept of "computational law" or "algorithmic law". This involves creating a separate legal framework for AI systems, with rules and regulations translated into a machine-readable, algorithmic format to avoid the ambiguity of natural language. The paper emphasises the need for a "dedicated operational context" for autonomous AI systems, analogous to the "operational design domain" for autonomous vehicles. This means creating a specific, clearly defined environment and set of rules within which the AI can operate safely and effectively. The model advocates for training AI systems on controlled, synthetically generated data to ensure fairness and ethical considerations are embedded from the start. Game theory is also proposed as a method for calculating the optimal strategy for the AI to achieve its goals within these ethical and legal constraints. The provided analysis highlights the importance of explainable AI (XAI) to ensure the transparency and accountability of decisions made by autonomous systems. This is crucial for building trust and for complying with the "right to explanation".</description>

      <title>A semi-automatic approach to study population dynamics based on population pyramids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The depiction of populations - of humans or animals - as "population pyramids" is a useful tool for the assessment of various characteristics of populations at a glance. Although these visualisations are well-known objects in various communities, formalised and algorithmic approaches to gain information from these data are less present. Here, we present an algorithm-based classification of population data into "pyramids" of different shapes ([normal and inverted] pyramid / plunger / bell, [lower / middle / upper] diamond, column, hourglass) that are linked to specific characteristics of the population. To develop the algorithmic approach, we used data describing global zoo populations of mammals from 1970-2024. This algorithm-based approach delivers plausible classifications, in particular with respect to changes in population size linked to specific series of, and transitions between, different "pyramid" shapes. We believe this approach might become a useful tool for analysing and communicating historical population developments in multiple contexts and is of broad interest. Moreover, it might be useful for animal population management strategies.</description>

      <title>Viability of perturbative expansion for quantum field theories on neurons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Network (NN) architectures that break statistical independence of parameters have been proposed as a new approach for simulating local quantum field theories (QFTs). In the infinite neuron number limit, single-layer NNs can exactly reproduce QFT results. This paper examines the viability of this architecture for perturbative calculations of local QFTs for finite neuron number $N$ using scalar $\phi^4$ theory in $d$ Euclidean dimensions as an example. We find that the renormalized $O(1/N)$ corrections to two- and four-point correlators yield perturbative series which are sensitive to the ultraviolet cut-off and therefore have a weak convergence. We propose a modification to the architecture to improve this convergence and discuss constraints on the parameters of the theory and the scaling of N which allow us to extract accurate field theory results.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Sparse Parallelism for Large Scale Deep Learning Recommendation Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of deep learning recommendation models (DLRM) has led to a growing need for large-scale distributed systems that can efficiently train vast amounts of data. In DLRM, the sparse embedding table is a crucial component for managing sparse categorical features. Typically, these tables in industrial DLRMs contain trillions of parameters, necessitating model parallelism strategies to address memory constraints. However, as training systems expand with massive GPUs, the traditional fully parallelism strategies for embedding table post significant scalability challenges, including imbalance and straggler issues, intensive lookup communication, and heavy embedding activation memory. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel two-dimensional sparse parallelism approach. Rather than fully sharding tables across all GPUs, our solution introduces data parallelism on top of model parallelism. This enables efficient all-to-all communication and reduces peak memory consumption. Additionally, we have developed the momentum-scaled row-wise AdaGrad algorithm to mitigate performance losses associated with the shift in training paradigms. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances training efficiency while maintaining model performance parity. It achieves nearly linear training speed scaling up to 4K GPUs, setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark for recommendation model training.</description>

      <title>Hallucination to Truth: A Review of Fact-Checking and Factuality Evaluation in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast and diverse internet corpora that often include inaccurate or misleading content. Consequently, LLMs can generate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review systematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual accuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset limitations, and the reliability of evaluation metrics. The review emphasizes the need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting strategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of the recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and mitigation techniques. The review also discusses the role of instruction tuning, multi-agent reasoning, and external knowledge access via RAG frameworks. Key findings highlight the limitations of current metrics, the value of grounding outputs with validated external evidence, and the importance of domain-specific customization to improve factual consistency. Overall, the review underlines the importance of building LLMs that are not only accurate and explainable but also tailored for domain-specific fact-checking. These insights contribute to the advancement of research toward more trustworthy and context-aware language models.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a class of algebraic varieties naturally associated with ReLU neural networks, arising from the piecewise linear structure of their outputs across activation regions in input space, and the piecewise multilinear structure in parameter space. By analyzing the rank constraints on the network outputs within each activation region, we derive polynomial equations that characterize the functions representable by the network. We further investigate conditions under which these varieties attain their expected dimension, providing insight into the expressive and structural properties of ReLU networks.</description>

      <title>Reliable Programmatic Weak Supervision with Confidence Intervals for Label Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate labeling of datasets is often both costly and time-consuming. Given an unlabeled dataset, programmatic weak supervision obtains probabilistic predictions for the labels by leveraging multiple weak labeling functions (LFs) that provide rough guesses for labels. Weak LFs commonly provide guesses with assorted types and unknown interdependences that can result in unreliable predictions. Furthermore, existing techniques for programmatic weak supervision cannot provide assessments for the reliability of the probabilistic predictions for labels. This paper presents a methodology for programmatic weak supervision that can provide confidence intervals for label probabilities and obtain more reliable predictions. In particular, the methods proposed use uncertainty sets of distributions that encapsulate the information provided by LFs with unrestricted behavior and typology. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show the improvement of the presented methods over the state-of-the-art and the practicality of the confidence intervals presented.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning in MDPs with Information-Ordered Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an epoch-based reinforcement learning algorithm for infinite-horizon average-cost Markov decision processes (MDPs) that leverages a partial order over a policy class. In this structure, $\pi' \leq \pi$ if data collected under $\pi$ can be used to estimate the performance of $\pi'$, enabling counterfactual inference without additional environment interaction. Leveraging this partial order, we show that our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{w \log(|\Theta|) T})$, where $w$ is the width of the partial order. Notably, the bound is independent of the state and action space sizes. We illustrate the applicability of these partial orders in many domains in operations research, including inventory control and queuing systems. For each, we apply our framework to that problem, yielding new theoretical guarantees and strong empirical results without imposing extra assumptions such as convexity in the inventory model or specialized arrival-rate structure in the queuing model.</description>

      <title>Comparing Normalization Methods for Portfolio Optimization with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable results in various domains, including robotics, games, natural language processing, and finance. In the financial domain, this approach has been applied to tasks such as portfolio optimization, where an agent continuously adjusts the allocation of assets within a financial portfolio to maximize profit. Numerous studies have introduced new simulation environments, neural network architectures, and training algorithms for this purpose. Among these, a domain-specific policy gradient algorithm has gained significant attention in the research community for being lightweight, fast, and for outperforming other approaches. However, recent studies have shown that this algorithm can yield inconsistent results and underperform, especially when the portfolio does not consist of cryptocurrencies. One possible explanation for this issue is that the commonly used state normalization method may cause the agent to lose critical information about the true value of the assets being traded. This paper explores this hypothesis by evaluating two of the most widely used normalization methods across three different markets (IBOVESPA, NYSE, and cryptocurrencies) and comparing them with the standard practice of normalizing data before training. The results indicate that, in this specific domain, the state normalization can indeed degrade the agent's performance.</description>

      <title>Point-Based Shape Representation Generation with a Correspondence-Preserving Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a diffusion model designed to generate point-based shape representations with correspondences. Traditional statistical shape models have considered point correspondences extensively, but current deep learning methods do not take them into account, focusing on unordered point clouds instead. Current deep generative models for point clouds do not address generating shapes with point correspondences between generated shapes. This work aims to formulate a diffusion model that is capable of generating realistic point-based shape representations, which preserve point correspondences that are present in the training data. Using shape representation data with correspondences derived from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 3 (OASIS-3), we demonstrate that our correspondence-preserving model effectively generates point-based hippocampal shape representations that are highly realistic compared to existing methods. We further demonstrate the applications of our generative model by downstream tasks, such as conditional generation of healthy and AD subjects and predicting morphological changes of disease progression by counterfactual generation.</description>

      <title>ASTRA: Autonomous Spatial-Temporal Red-teaming for AI Software Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software development, but their safety remains deeply uncertain-especially in high-stakes domains like cybersecurity. Current red-teaming tools often rely on fixed benchmarks or unrealistic prompts, missing many real-world vulnerabilities. We present ASTRA, an automated agent system designed to systematically uncover safety flaws in AI-driven code generation and security guidance systems. ASTRA works in three stages: (1) it builds structured domain-specific knowledge graphs that model complex software tasks and known weaknesses; (2) it performs online vulnerability exploration of each target model by adaptively probing both its input space, i.e., the spatial exploration, and its reasoning processes, i.e., the temporal exploration, guided by the knowledge graphs; and (3) it generates high-quality violation-inducing cases to improve model alignment. Unlike prior methods, ASTRA focuses on realistic inputs-requests that developers might actually ask-and uses both offline abstraction guided domain modeling and online domain knowledge graph adaptation to surface corner-case vulnerabilities. Across two major evaluation domains, ASTRA finds 11-66% more issues than existing techniques and produces test cases that lead to 17% more effective alignment training, showing its practical value for building safer AI systems.</description>

      <title>Measuring the stability and plasticity of recommender systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The typical offline protocol to evaluate recommendation algorithms is to collect a dataset of user-item interactions and then use a part of this dataset to train a model, and the remaining data to measure how closely the model recommendations match the observed user interactions. This protocol is straightforward, useful and practical, but it only captures performance of a particular model trained at some point in the past. We know, however, that online systems evolve over time. In general, it is a good idea that models reflect such changes, so models are frequently retrained with recent data. But if this is the case, to what extent can we trust previous evaluations? How will a model perform when a different pattern (re)emerges? In this paper we propose a methodology to study how recommendation models behave when they are retrained. The idea is to profile algorithms according to their ability to, on the one hand, retain past patterns -- stability -- and, on the other hand, (quickly) adapt to changes -- plasticity. We devise an offline evaluation protocol that provides detail on the long-term behavior of models, and that is agnostic to datasets, algorithms and metrics. To illustrate the potential of this framework, we present preliminary results of three different types of algorithms on the GoodReads dataset that suggest different stability and plasticity profiles depending on the algorithmic technique, and a possible trade-off between stability and plasticity.Although additional experiments will be necessary to confirm these observations, they already illustrate the usefulness of the proposed framework to gain insights on the long term dynamics of recommendation models.</description>

      <title>Step More: Going Beyond Single Backpropagation in Meta Learning Based Model Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) underpin many AI applications, but their static nature makes updating knowledge costly. Model editing offers an efficient alternative by injecting new information through targeted parameter modifications. In particular, meta-learning-based model editing (MLBME) methods have demonstrated notable advantages in both editing effectiveness and efficiency. Despite this, we find that MLBME exhibits suboptimal performance in low-data scenarios, and its training efficiency is bottlenecked by the computation of KL divergence. To address these, we propose $\textbf{S}$tep $\textbf{M}$ore $\textbf{Edit}$ ($\textbf{SMEdit}$), a novel MLBME method that adopts $\textbf{M}$ultiple $\textbf{B}$ackpro$\textbf{P}$agation $\textbf{S}$teps ($\textbf{MBPS}$) to improve editing performance under limited supervision and a norm regularization on weight updates to improve training efficiency. Experimental results on two datasets and two LLMs demonstrate that SMEdit outperforms prior MLBME baselines and the MBPS strategy can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods to further boost their performance. Our code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Efficient Strategy for Improving Large Language Model (LLM) Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a milestone in the field of artificial intelligence and natural language processing. However, their large-scale deployment remains constrained by the need for significant computational resources. This work proposes starting from a base model to explore and combine data processing and careful data selection techniques, training strategies, and architectural adjustments to improve the efficiency of LLMs in resource-constrained environments and within a delimited knowledge base. The methodological approach included defining criteria for building reliable datasets, conducting controlled experiments with different configurations, and systematically evaluating the resulting variants in terms of capability, versatility, response time, and safety. Finally, comparative tests were conducted to measure the performance of the developed variants and to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies. This work is based on the master's thesis in Systems and Computer Engineering titled "Efficient Strategy for Improving the Capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiplication of a sparse matrix with another (dense or sparse) matrix is a fundamental operation that captures the computational patterns of many data science applications, including but not limited to graph algorithms, sparsely connected neural networks, graph neural networks, clustering, and many-to-many comparisons of biological sequencing data.
  In many application scenarios, the matrix multiplication takes places on an arbitrary algebraic semiring where the scalar operations are overloaded with user-defined functions with certain properties or a more general heterogenous algebra where even the domains of the input matrices can be different. Here, we provide a unifying treatment of the sparse matrix-matrix operation and its rich application space including machine learning, computational biology and chemistry, graph algorithms, and scientific computing.</description>

      <title>RLGS: Reinforcement Learning-Based Adaptive Hyperparameter Tuning for Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a labor-intensive and expert-driven process, often resulting in inconsistent reconstructions and suboptimal results. We propose RLGS, a plug-and-play reinforcement learning framework for adaptive hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS through lightweight policy modules, dynamically adjusting critical hyperparameters such as learning rates and densification thresholds. The framework is model-agnostic and seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS pipelines without architectural modifications. We demonstrate its generalization ability across multiple state-of-the-art 3DGS variants, including Taming-3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC, and validate its robustness across diverse datasets. RLGS consistently enhances rendering quality. For example, it improves Taming-3DGS by 0.7dB PSNR on the Tanks and Temple (TNT) dataset, under a fixed Gaussian budget, and continues to yield gains even when baseline performance saturates. Our results suggest that RLGS provides an effective and general solution for automating hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS training, bridging a gap in applying reinforcement learning to 3DGS.</description>

      <title>Convolutional autoencoders for the reconstruction of three-dimensional interfacial multiphase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a comprehensive investigation of autoencoders for reduced-order modeling of three-dimensional multiphase flows. Focusing on the accuracy of reconstructing multiphase flow volume/mass fractions with a standard convolutional architecture, we examine the advantages and disadvantages of different interface representation choices (diffuse, sharp, level set). We use a combination of synthetic data with non-trivial interface topologies and high-resolution simulation data of multiphase homogeneous isotropic turbulence for training and validation. This study clarifies the best practices for reducing the dimensionality of multiphase flows via autoencoders. Consequently, this paves the path for uncoupling the training of autoencoders for accurate reconstruction and the training of temporal or input/output models such as neural operators (e.g., FNOs, DeepONets) and neural ODEs on the lower-dimensional latent space given by the autoencoders. As such, the implications of this study are significant and of interest to the multiphase flow community and beyond.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum--Classical Machine Learning Potential with Variational Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for simulating large and complex molecular systems are still in their infancy, and surpassing state-of-the-art classical techniques remains an ever-receding goal post. A promising avenue of inquiry in the meanwhile is to seek practical advantages through hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, which combine conventional neural networks with variational quantum circuits (VQCs) running on today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Such hybrids are well suited to NISQ hardware. The classical processor performs the bulk of the computation, while the quantum processor executes targeted sub-tasks that supply additional non-linearity and expressivity. Here, we benchmark a purely classical E(3)-equivariant message-passing machine learning potential (MLP) against a hybrid quantum-classical MLP for predicting density functional theory (DFT) properties of liquid silicon. In our hybrid architecture, every readout in the message-passing layers is replaced by a VQC. Molecular dynamics simulations driven by the HQC-MLP reveal that an accurate reproduction of high-temperature structural and thermodynamic properties is achieved with VQCs. These findings demonstrate a concrete scenario in which NISQ-compatible HQC algorithm could deliver a measurable benefit over the best available classical alternative, suggesting a viable pathway toward near-term quantum advantage in materials modeling.</description>

Abstract: Negative binomial regression is essential for analyzing over-dispersed count data in in comparative studies, but parameter estimation becomes computationally challenging in large screens requiring millions of comparisons. We investigate using a pre-trained transformer to produce estimates of negative binomial regression parameters from observed count data, trained through synthetic data generation to learn to invert the process of generating counts from parameters. The transformer method achieved better parameter accuracy than maximum likelihood optimization while being 20 times faster. However, comparisons unexpectedly revealed that method of moment estimates performed as well as maximum likelihood optimization in accuracy, while being 1,000 times faster and producing better-calibrated and more powerful tests, making it the most efficient solution for this application.</description>

      <title>Learning Using Privileged Information for Litter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As litter pollution continues to rise globally, developing automated tools capable of detecting litter effectively remains a significant challenge. This study presents a novel approach that combines, for the first time, privileged information with deep learning object detection to improve litter detection while maintaining model efficiency. We evaluate our method across five widely used object detection models, addressing challenges such as detecting small litter and objects partially obscured by grass or stones. In addition to this, a key contribution of our work can also be attributed to formulating a means of encoding bounding box information as a binary mask, which can be fed to the detection model to refine detection guidance. Through experiments on both within-dataset evaluation on the renowned SODA dataset and cross-dataset evaluation on the BDW and UAVVaste litter detection datasets, we demonstrate consistent performance improvements across all models. Our approach not only bolsters detection accuracy within the training sets but also generalises well to other litter detection contexts. Crucially, these improvements are achieved without increasing model complexity or adding extra layers, ensuring computational efficiency and scalability. Our results suggest that this methodology offers a practical solution for litter detection, balancing accuracy and efficiency in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Difficulty-Based Preference Data Selection by DPO Implicit Reward Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is a critical challenge in AI research. While methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are widely used, they often rely on large, costly preference datasets. The current work lacks methods for high-quality data selection specifically for preference data. In this work, we introduce a novel difficulty-based data selection strategy for preference datasets, grounded in the DPO implicit reward mechanism. By selecting preference data examples with smaller DPO implicit reward gaps, which are indicative of more challenging cases, we improve data efficiency and model alignment. Our approach consistently outperforms five strong baselines across multiple datasets and alignment tasks, achieving superior performance with only 10\% of the original data. This principled, efficient selection method offers a promising solution for scaling LLM alignment with limited resources.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Selective Encryption Against Gradient Inversion Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient inversion attacks pose significant privacy threats to distributed training frameworks such as federated learning, enabling malicious parties to reconstruct sensitive local training data from gradient communications between clients and an aggregation server during the aggregation process. While traditional encryption-based defenses, such as homomorphic encryption, offer strong privacy guarantees without compromising model utility, they often incur prohibitive computational overheads. To mitigate this, selective encryption has emerged as a promising approach, encrypting only a subset of gradient data based on the data's significance under a certain metric. However, there have been few systematic studies on how to specify this metric in practice. This paper systematically evaluates selective encryption methods with different significance metrics against state-of-the-art attacks. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of selective encryption in reducing computational overhead while maintaining resilience against attacks. We propose a distance-based significance analysis framework that provides theoretical foundations for selecting critical gradient elements for encryption. Through extensive experiments on different model architectures (LeNet, CNN, BERT, GPT-2) and attack types, we identify gradient magnitude as a generally effective metric for protection against optimization-based gradient inversions. However, we also observe that no single selective encryption strategy is universally optimal across all attack scenarios, and we provide guidelines for choosing appropriate strategies for different model architectures and privacy requirements.</description>

      <title>Agentic-AI based Mathematical Framework for Commercialization of Energy Resilience in Electrical Distribution System Planning and Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing vulnerability of electrical distribution systems to extreme weather events and cyber threats necessitates the development of economically viable frameworks for resilience enhancement. While existing approaches focus primarily on technical resilience metrics and enhancement strategies, there remains a significant gap in establishing market-driven mechanisms that can effectively commercialize resilience features while optimizing their deployment through intelligent decision-making. Moreover, traditional optimization approaches for distribution network reconfiguration often fail to dynamically adapt to both normal and emergency conditions. This paper introduces a novel framework integrating dual-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with market-based mechanisms, achieving an average resilience score of 0.85 0.08 over 10 test episodes. The proposed architecture leverages a dual-agent PPO scheme, where a strategic agent selects optimal DER-driven switching configurations, while a tactical agent fine-tunes individual switch states and grid preferences under budget and weather constraints. These agents interact within a custom-built dynamic simulation environment that models stochastic calamity events, budget limits, and resilience-cost trade-offs. A comprehensive reward function is designed that balances resilience enhancement objectives with market profitability (with up to 200x reward incentives, resulting in 85% of actions during calamity steps selecting configurations with 4 DERs), incorporating factors such as load recovery speed, system robustness, and customer satisfaction. Over 10 test episodes, the framework achieved a benefit-cost ratio of 0.12 0.01, demonstrating sustainable market incentives for resilience investment. This framework creates sustainable market incentives</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While subjective evaluations in recent years indicate rapid progress in TTS, can current TTS systems truly pass a human deception test in a Turing-like evaluation? We introduce Human Fooling Rate (HFR), a metric that directly measures how often machine-generated speech is mistaken for human. Our large-scale evaluation of open-source and commercial TTS models reveals critical insights: (i) CMOS-based claims of human parity often fail under deception testing, (ii) TTS progress should be benchmarked on datasets where human speech achieves high HFRs, as evaluating against monotonous or less expressive reference samples sets a low bar, (iii) Commercial models approach human deception in zero-shot settings, while open-source systems still struggle with natural conversational speech; (iv) Fine-tuning on high-quality data improves realism but does not fully bridge the gap. Our findings underscore the need for more realistic, human-centric evaluations alongside existing subjective tests.</description>

      <title>NVSpeech: An Integrated and Scalable Pipeline for Human-Like Speech Modeling with Paralinguistic Vocalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Paralinguistic vocalizations-including non-verbal sounds like laughter and breathing, as well as lexicalized interjections such as "uhm" and "oh"-are integral to natural spoken communication. Despite their importance in conveying affect, intent, and interactional cues, such cues remain largely overlooked in conventional automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) systems. We present NVSpeech, an integrated and scalable pipeline that bridges the recognition and synthesis of paralinguistic vocalizations, encompassing dataset construction, ASR modeling, and controllable TTS. (1) We introduce a manually annotated dataset of 48,430 human-spoken utterances with 18 word-level paralinguistic categories. (2) We develop the paralinguistic-aware ASR model, which treats paralinguistic cues as inline decodable tokens (e.g., "You're so funny [Laughter]"), enabling joint lexical and non-verbal transcription. This model is then used to automatically annotate a large corpus, the first large-scale Chinese dataset of 174,179 utterances (573 hours) with word-level alignment and paralingustic cues. (3) We finetune zero-shot TTS models on both human- and auto-labeled data to enable explicit control over paralinguistic vocalizations, allowing context-aware insertion at arbitrary token positions for human-like speech synthesis. By unifying the recognition and generation of paralinguistic vocalizations, NVSpeech offers the first open, large-scale, word-level annotated pipeline for expressive speech modeling in Mandarin, integrating recognition and synthesis in a scalable and controllable manner. Dataset and audio demos are available at https://nvspeech170k.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap Deep Spectral Clustering with Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral clustering is a leading clustering method. Two of its major shortcomings are the disjoint optimization process and the limited representation capacity. To address these issues, we propose a deep spectral clustering model (named BootSC), which jointly learns all stages of spectral clustering -- affinity matrix construction, spectral embedding, and $k$-means clustering -- using a single network in an end-to-end manner. BootSC leverages effective and efficient optimal-transport-derived supervision to bootstrap the affinity matrix and the cluster assignment matrix. Moreover, a semantically-consistent orthogonal re-parameterization technique is introduced to orthogonalize spectral embeddings, significantly enhancing the discrimination capability. Experimental results indicate that BootSC achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance. For example, it accomplishes a notable 16\% NMI improvement over the runner-up method on the challenging ImageNet-Dogs dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/spdj2271/BootSC.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Text Classification Using Black Box Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) aims to assign texts to structured label hierarchies; however, it faces challenges due to data scarcity and model complexity. This study explores the feasibility of using black box Large Language Models (LLMs) accessed via APIs for HTC, as an alternative to traditional machine learning methods that require extensive labeled data and computational resources. We evaluate three prompting strategies -- Direct Leaf Label Prediction (DL), Direct Hierarchical Label Prediction (DH), and Top-down Multi-step Hierarchical Label Prediction (TMH) -- in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, comparing the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of these strategies. Experiments on two datasets show that a few-shot setting consistently improves classification accuracy compared to a zero-shot setting. While a traditional machine learning model achieves high accuracy on a dataset with a shallow hierarchy, LLMs, especially DH strategy, tend to outperform the machine learning model on a dataset with a deeper hierarchy. API costs increase significantly due to the higher input tokens required for deeper label hierarchies on DH strategy. These results emphasize the trade-off between accuracy improvement and the computational cost of prompt strategy. These findings highlight the potential of black box LLMs for HTC while underscoring the need to carefully select a prompt strategy to balance performance and cost.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning for VLMs: A Survey and Taxonomy Beyond Forgetting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across diverse multimodal tasks by leveraging large-scale pre-training. However, enabling them to learn continually from non-stationary data remains a major challenge, as their cross-modal alignment and generalization capabilities are particularly vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting. Unlike traditional unimodal continual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal feature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and zero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and systematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL). We begin by identifying the three core failure modes that degrade performance in VLM-CL. Based on these, we propose a challenge-driven taxonomy that maps solutions to their target problems: (1) \textit{Multi-Modal Replay Strategies} address cross-modal drift through explicit or implicit memory mechanisms; (2) \textit{Cross-Modal Regularization} preserves modality alignment during updates; and (3) \textit{Parameter-Efficient Adaptation} mitigates parameter interference with modular or low-rank updates. We further analyze current evaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better benchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional generalization. Finally, we outline open problems and future directions, including continual pre-training and compositional zero-shot learning. This survey aims to serve as a comprehensive and diagnostic reference for researchers developing lifelong vision-language systems.

      <title>LayerT2V: Interactive Multi-Object Trajectory Layering for Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling object motion trajectories in Text-to-Video (T2V) generation is a challenging and relatively under-explored area, particularly in scenarios involving multiple moving objects. Most community models and datasets in the T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect, primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

      <title>Deep Neural Network-Driven Adaptive Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a deep neural network (DNN)-driven framework to address the longstanding generalization challenge in adaptive filtering (AF). In contrast to traditional AF frameworks that emphasize explicit cost function design, the proposed framework shifts the paradigm toward direct gradient acquisition. The DNN, functioning as a universal nonlinear operator, is structurally embedded into the core architecture of the AF system, establishing a direct mapping between filtering residuals and learning gradients. The maximum likelihood is adopted as the implicit cost function, rendering the derived algorithm inherently data-driven and thus endowed with exemplary generalization capability, which is validated by extensive numerical experiments across a spectrum of non-Gaussian scenarios. Corresponding mean value and mean square stability analyses are also conducted in detail.</description>

      <title>Segment Any Vehicle: Semantic and Visual Context Driven SAM and A Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception, particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge. Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. % Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released upon acceptance. Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/SAV</description>

      <title>A virtual sensor fusion approach for state of charge estimation of lithium-ion cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the estimation of the State Of Charge (SOC) of lithium-ion cells via the combination of two widely used paradigms: Kalman Filters (KFs) equipped with Equivalent Circuit Models (ECMs) and machine-learning approaches. In particular, a recent Virtual Sensor (VS) synthesis technique is considered, which operates as follows: (i) learn an Affine Parameter-Varying (APV) model of the cell directly from data, (ii) derive a bank of linear observers from the APV model, (iii) train a machine-learning technique from features extracted from the observers together with input and output data to predict the SOC. The SOC predictions returned by the VS are supplied to an Extended KF (EKF) as output measurements along with the cell terminal voltage, combining the two paradigms. A data-driven calibration strategy for the noise covariance matrices of the EKF is proposed. Experimental results show that the designed approach is beneficial w.r.t. SOC estimation accuracy and smoothness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show significant potential in healthcare, prompting numerous benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities. However, concerns persist regarding the reliability of these benchmarks, which often lack clinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety-oriented evaluation metrics. To address these shortcomings, we introduce MedCheck, the first lifecycle-oriented assessment framework specifically designed for medical benchmarks. Our framework deconstructs a benchmark's development into five continuous stages, from design to governance, and provides a comprehensive checklist of 46 medically-tailored criteria. Using MedCheck, we conducted an in-depth empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks. Our analysis uncovers widespread, systemic issues, including a profound disconnect from clinical practice, a crisis of data integrity due to unmitigated contamination risks, and a systematic neglect of safety-critical evaluation dimensions like model robustness and uncertainty awareness. Based on these findings, MedCheck serves as both a diagnostic tool for existing benchmarks and an actionable guideline to foster a more standardized, reliable, and transparent approach to evaluating AI in healthcare.</description>

      <title>Chain of Questions: Guiding Multimodal Curiosity in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced through methods such as chain-of-thought and explicit step-by-step explanations. However, these improvements have not yet fully transitioned to multimodal contexts, where models must proactively decide which sensory modalities such as vision, audio, or spatial perception to engage when interacting with complex real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach that encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted questions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the model to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical information necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We evaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by integrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to effectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information. This leads to improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process with diverse multimodal tasks.</description>

      <title>VisionTS++: Cross-Modal Time Series Foundation Model with Continual Pre-trained Visual Backbones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that vision models pre-trained on images can perform well in time series forecasting by reformulating forecasting as an image reconstruction task, suggesting their potential as universal time series foundation models. However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time series remains challenging due to three key discrepancies: (1) data-modality gap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time series; (2) multivariate-forecasting gap between standard RGB three-channel-based vision models and the need to model time series with arbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) probabilistic-forecasting gap between the deterministic output formats of most vision models and the requirement for uncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose VisionTS++, a vision-model-based TSFM that performs continual pre-training on large-scale time series datasets, including 3 innovations: (1) a vision-model-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality time series data, thereby mitigating modality gap and improving pre-training stability, (2) a colorized multivariate conversion method that transforms multivariate time series into multi-subfigure RGB images, capturing complex inter-variate dependencies; and (3) a multi-quantile forecasting approach using parallel reconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels, thus more flexibly approximating arbitrary output distributions without restrictive prior distributional assumptions. Evaluated on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution TSF benchmarks, \model achieves SOTA results, outperforming specialized TSFMs by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in 9 out of 12 probabilistic forecasting settings. Our work establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal knowledge transfer, advancing the development of universal TSFMs.</description>

      <title>Improving Crash Data Quality with Large Language Models: Evidence from Secondary Crash Narratives in Kentucky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to enhance crash data quality by mining crash narratives, using secondary crash identification in Kentucky as a case study. Drawing from 16,656 manually reviewed narratives from 2015-2022, with 3,803 confirmed secondary crashes, we compare three model classes: zero-shot open-source large language models (LLMs) (LLaMA3:70B, DeepSeek-R1:70B, Qwen3:32B, Gemma3:27B); fine-tuned transformers (BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, Longformer); and traditional logistic regression as baseline. Models were calibrated on 2015-2021 data and tested on 1,771 narratives from 2022. Fine-tuned transformers achieved superior performance, with RoBERTa yielding the highest F1-score (0.90) and accuracy (95%). Zero-shot LLaMA3:70B reached a comparable F1 of 0.86 but required 139 minutes of inference; the logistic baseline lagged well behind (F1:0.66). LLMs excelled in recall for some variants (e.g., GEMMA3:27B at 0.94) but incurred high computational costs (up to 723 minutes for DeepSeek-R1:70B), while fine-tuned models processed the test set in seconds after brief training. Further analysis indicated that mid-sized LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1:32B) can rival larger counterparts in performance while reducing runtime, suggesting opportunities for optimized deployments. Results highlight trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and data requirements, with fine-tuned transformer models balancing precision and recall effectively on Kentucky data. Practical deployment considerations emphasize privacy-preserving local deployment, ensemble approaches for improved accuracy, and incremental processing for scalability, providing a replicable scheme for enhancing crash-data quality with advanced NLP.</description>

      <title>The Relative Instability of Model Comparison with Cross-validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing work has shown that cross-validation (CV) can be used to provide an asymptotic confidence interval for the test error of a stable machine learning algorithm, and existing stability results for many popular algorithms can be applied to derive positive instances where such confidence intervals will be valid. However, in the common setting where CV is used to compare two algorithms, it becomes necessary to consider a notion of relative stability which cannot easily be derived from existing stability results, even for simple algorithms. To better understand relative stability and when CV provides valid confidence intervals for the test error difference of two algorithms, we study the soft-thresholded least squares algorithm, a close cousin of the Lasso. We prove that while stability holds when assessing the individual test error of this algorithm, relative stability fails to hold when comparing the test error of two such algorithms, even in a sparse low-dimensional linear model setting. Additionally, we empirically confirm the invalidity of CV confidence intervals for the test error difference when either soft-thresholding or the Lasso is used. In short, caution is needed when quantifying the uncertainty of CV estimates of the performance difference of two machine learning algorithms, even when both algorithms are individually stable.</description>

      <title>Algorithm Selection for Recommender Systems via Meta-Learning on Algorithm Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Algorithm Selection Problem for recommender systems-choosing the best algorithm for a given user or context-remains a significant challenge. Traditional meta-learning approaches often treat algorithms as categorical choices, ignoring their intrinsic properties. Recent work has shown that explicitly characterizing algorithms with features can improve model performance in other domains. Building on this, we propose a per-user meta-learning approach for recommender system selection that leverages both user meta-features and automatically extracted algorithm features from source code. Our preliminary results, averaged over six diverse datasets, show that augmenting a meta-learner with algorithm features improves its average NDCG@10 performance by 8.83% from 0.135 (user features only) to 0.147. This enhanced model outperforms the Single Best Algorithm baseline (0.131) and successfully closes 10.5% of the performance gap to a theoretical oracle selector. These findings show that even static source code metrics provide a valuable predictive signal, presenting a promising direction for building more robust and intelligent recommender systems.</description>

      <title>StepFun-Formalizer: Unlocking the Autoformalization Potential of LLMs through Knowledge-Reasoning Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoformalization aims to translate natural-language mathematical statements into a formal language. While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area, existing methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities for effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language domain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem understanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot identify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to interpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions. To address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training pipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by distilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and another by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by expert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to further fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models exhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal reasoning. Notably, StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores of 40.5% on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench, surpassing all prior general-purpose and specialized models.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Uncertainty and its Disentanglement in multi-label Chest X-Ray Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for trustworthy decision-making and the deployment of AI models in medical imaging. While prior work has explored the ability of neural networks to quantify predictive, epistemic, and aleatoric uncertainties using an information-theoretical approach in synthetic or well defined data settings like natural image classification, its applicability to real life medical diagnosis tasks remains underexplored. In this study, we provide an extensive uncertainty quantification benchmark for multi-label chest X-ray classification using the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset. We evaluate 13 uncertainty quantification methods for convolutional (ResNet) and transformer-based (Vision Transformer) architectures across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, we extend Evidential Deep Learning, HetClass NNs, and Deep Deterministic Uncertainty to the multi-label setting. Our analysis provides insights into uncertainty estimation effectiveness and the ability to disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, revealing method- and architecture-specific strengths and limitations.</description>

      <title>Zero-Residual Concept Erasure via Progressive Alignment in Text-to-Image Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concept Erasure, which aims to prevent pretrained text-to-image models from generating content associated with semantic-harmful concepts (i.e., target concepts), is getting increased attention. State-of-the-art methods formulate this task as an optimization problem: they align all target concepts with semantic-harmless anchor concepts, and apply closed-form solutions to update the model accordingly. While these closed-form methods are efficient, we argue that existing methods have two overlooked limitations: 1) They often result in incomplete erasure due to "non-zero alignment residual", especially when text prompts are relatively complex. 2) They may suffer from generation quality degradation as they always concentrate parameter updates in a few deep layers. To address these issues, we propose a novel closed-form method ErasePro: it is designed for more complete concept erasure and better preserving overall generative quality. Specifically, ErasePro first introduces a strict zero-residual constraint into the optimization objective, ensuring perfect alignment between target and anchor concept features and enabling more complete erasure. Secondly, it employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy that gradually transfers target concept features to those of the anchor concept from shallow to deep layers. As the depth increases, the required parameter changes diminish, thereby reducing deviations in sensitive deep layers and preserving generative quality. Empirical results across different concept erasure tasks (including instance, art style, and nudity erasure) have demonstrated the effectiveness of our ErasePro.</description>

      <title>Metric Learning in an RKHS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metric learning from a set of triplet comparisons in the form of "Do you think item h is more similar to item i or item j?", indicating similarity and differences between items, plays a key role in various applications including image retrieval, recommendation systems, and cognitive psychology. The goal is to learn a metric in the RKHS that reflects the comparisons. Nonlinear metric learning using kernel methods and neural networks have shown great empirical promise. While previous works have addressed certain aspects of this problem, there is little or no theoretical understanding of such methods. The exception is the special (linear) case in which the RKHS is the standard Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$; there is a comprehensive theory for metric learning in $\mathbb{R}^d$. This paper develops a general RKHS framework for metric learning and provides novel generalization guarantees and sample complexity bounds. We validate our findings through a set of simulations and experiments on real datasets. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/RamyaLab/metric-learning-RKHS.</description>

      <title>OS Agents: A Survey on MLLM-based Agents for General Computing Devices Use</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution of (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to reality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computing devices (e.g., computers and mobile phones) by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g., Graphical User Interface (GUI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate tasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the environment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential capabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions for future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and self-evolution. This survey aims to consolidate the state of OS Agents research, providing insights to guide both academic inquiry and industrial development. An open-source GitHub repository is maintained as a dynamic resource to foster further innovation in this field. We present a 9-page version of our work, accepted by ACL 2025, to provide a concise overview to the domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the close relationship between Kolmogorov complexity and unsupervised machine learning, we explore quantum circuit complexity, an important concept in quantum computation and quantum information science, as a pivot to understand and to build interpretable and efficient unsupervised machine learning for topological order in quantum many-body systems. To span a bridge from conceptual power to practical applicability, we present two theorems that connect Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity for the quantum path planning between two arbitrary quantum many-body states with fidelity change and entanglement generation, respectively. Leveraging these connections, fidelity-based and entanglement-based similarity measures or kernels, which are more practical for implementation, are formulated. Using the two proposed kernels, numerical experiments targeting the unsupervised clustering of quantum phases of the bond-alternating XXZ spin chain, the ground state of Kitaev's toric code and random product states, are conducted, demonstrating their superior performance. Relations with classical shadow tomography and shadow kernel learning are also discussed, where the latter can be naturally derived and understood from our approach. Our results establish connections between key concepts and tools of quantum circuit computation, quantum complexity, and machine learning of topological quantum order.</description>

      <title>Argumentative Debates for Transparent Bias Detection [Technical Report]</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the use of AI systems in society grows, addressing potential biases that emerge from data or are learned by models is essential to prevent systematic disadvantages against specific groups. Several notions of (un)fairness have been proposed in the literature, alongside corresponding algorithmic methods for detecting and mitigating unfairness, but, with very few exceptions, these tend to ignore transparency. Instead, interpretability and explainability are core requirements for algorithmic fairness, even more so than for other algorithmic solutions, given the human-oriented nature of fairness. In this paper, we contribute a novel interpretable, explainable method for bias detection relying on debates about the presence of bias against individuals, based on the values of protected features for the individuals and others in their neighbourhoods. Our method builds upon techniques from formal and computational argumentation, whereby debates result from arguing about biases within and across neighbourhoods. We provide formal, quantitative, and qualitative evaluations of our method, highlighting its strengths in performance against baselines, as well as its interpretability and explainability.</description>

      <title>Conditional Fetal Brain Atlas Learning for Automatic Tissue Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the fetal brain has become a key tool for studying brain development in vivo. Yet, its assessment remains challenging due to variability in brain maturation, imaging protocols, and uncertain estimates of Gestational Age (GA). To overcome these, brain atlases provide a standardized reference framework that facilitates objective evaluation and comparison across subjects by aligning the atlas and subjects in a common coordinate system. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-learning framework for generating continuous, age-specific fetal brain atlases for real-time fetal brain tissue segmentation. The framework combines a direct registration model with a conditional discriminator. Trained on a curated dataset of 219 neurotypical fetal MRIs spanning from 21 to 37 weeks of gestation. The method achieves high registration accuracy, captures dynamic anatomical changes with sharp structural detail, and robust segmentation performance with an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 86.3% across six brain tissues. Furthermore, volumetric analysis of the generated atlases reveals detailed neurotypical growth trajectories, providing valuable insights into the maturation of the fetal brain. This approach enables individualized developmental assessment with minimal pre-processing and real-time performance, supporting both research and clinical applications.

      <title>Augmentation-based Domain Generalization and Joint Training from Multiple Source Domains for Whole Heart Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the leading cause of death worldwide, cardiovascular diseases motivate the development of more sophisticated methods to analyze the heart and its substructures from medical images like Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance (MR). Semantic segmentations of important cardiac structures that represent the whole heart are useful to assess patient-specific cardiac morphology and pathology. Furthermore, accurate semantic segmentations can be used to generate cardiac digital twin models which allows e.g. electrophysiological simulation and personalized therapy planning. Even though deep learning-based methods for medical image segmentation achieved great advancements over the last decade, retaining good performance under domain shift -- i.e. when training and test data are sampled from different data distributions -- remains challenging. In order to perform well on domains known at training-time, we employ a (1) balanced joint training approach that utilizes CT and MR data in equal amounts from different source domains. Further, aiming to alleviate domain shift towards domains only encountered at test-time, we rely on (2) strong intensity and spatial augmentation techniques to greatly diversify the available training data. Our proposed whole heart segmentation method, a 5-fold ensemble with our contributions, achieves the best performance for MR data overall and a performance similar to the best performance for CT data when compared to a model trained solely on CT. With 93.33% DSC and 0.8388 mm ASSD for CT and 89.30% DSC and 1.2411 mm ASSD for MR data, our method demonstrates great potential to efficiently obtain accurate semantic segmentations from which patient-specific cardiac twin models can be generated.</description>

      <title>LA-CaRe-CNN: Cascading Refinement CNN for Left Atrial Scar Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents the most prevalent type of cardiac arrhythmia for which treatment may require patients to undergo ablation therapy. In this surgery cardiac tissues are locally scarred on purpose to prevent electrical signals from causing arrhythmia. Patient-specific cardiac digital twin models show great potential for personalized ablation therapy, however, they demand accurate semantic segmentation of healthy and scarred tissue typically obtained from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) magnetic resonance (MR) scans. In this work we propose the Left Atrial Cascading Refinement CNN (LA-CaRe-CNN), which aims to accurately segment the left atrium as well as left atrial scar tissue from LGE MR scans. LA-CaRe-CNN is a 2-stage CNN cascade that is trained end-to-end in 3D, where Stage 1 generates a prediction for the left atrium, which is then refined in Stage 2 in conjunction with the original image information to obtain a prediction for the left atrial scar tissue. To account for domain shift towards domains unknown during training, we employ strong intensity and spatial augmentation to increase the diversity of the training dataset. Our proposed method based on a 5-fold ensemble achieves great segmentation results, namely, 89.21% DSC and 1.6969 mm ASSD for the left atrium, as well as 64.59% DSC and 91.80% G-DSC for the more challenging left atrial scar tissue. Thus, segmentations obtained through LA-CaRe-CNN show great potential for the generation of patient-specific cardiac digital twin models and downstream tasks like personalized targeted ablation therapy to treat AF.</description>

Abstract: This work focuses on validation of attack pattern mining in the context of Industrial Control System (ICS) security. A comprehensive security assessment of an ICS requires generating a large and variety of attack patterns. For this purpose we have proposed a data driven technique to generate attack patterns for an ICS. The proposed technique has been used to generate over 100,000 attack patterns from data gathered from an operational water treatment plant. In this work we present a detailed case study to validate the attack patterns.</description>

      <title>Do Recommender Systems Really Leverage Multimodal Content? A Comprehensive Analysis on Multimodal Representations for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Recommender Systems aim to improve recommendation accuracy by integrating heterogeneous content, such as images and textual metadata. While effective, it remains unclear whether their gains stem from true multimodal understanding or increased model complexity. This work investigates the role of multimodal item embeddings, emphasizing the semantic informativeness of the representations. Initial experiments reveal that embeddings from standard extractors (e.g., ResNet50, Sentence-Bert) enhance performance, but rely on modality-specific encoders and ad hoc fusion strategies that lack control over cross-modal alignment. To overcome these limitations, we leverage Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generate multimodal-by-design embeddings via structured prompts. This approach yields semantically aligned representations without requiring any fusion. Experiments across multiple settings show notable performance improvements. Furthermore, LVLMs embeddings offer a distinctive advantage: they can be decoded into structured textual descriptions, enabling direct assessment of their multimodal comprehension. When such descriptions are incorporated as side content into recommender systems, they improve recommendation performance, empirically validating the semantic depth and alignment encoded within LVLMs outputs. Our study highlights the importance of semantically rich representations and positions LVLMs as a compelling foundation for building robust and meaningful multimodal representations in recommendation tasks.</description>

Abstract: Accurate estimation of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters from diffusion-weighted MRI remains challenging due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem and high sensitivity to noise, particularly in the perfusion compartment. In this work, we propose a probabilistic deep learning framework based on Deep Ensembles (DE) of Mixture Density Networks (MDNs), enabling estimation of total predictive uncertainty and decomposition into aleatoric (AU) and epistemic (EU) components. The method was benchmarked against non probabilistic neural networks, a Bayesian fitting approach and a probabilistic network with single Gaussian parametrization. Supervised training was performed on synthetic data, and evaluation was conducted on both simulated and an in vivo dataset. The reliability of the quantified uncertainties was assessed using calibration curves, output distribution sharpness, and the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). MDNs produced more calibrated and sharper predictive distributions for the diffusion coefficient D and fraction f parameters, although slight overconfidence was observed in pseudo-diffusion coefficient D*. The Robust Coefficient of Variation (RCV) indicated smoother in vivo estimates for D* with MDNs compared to Gaussian model. Despite the training data covering the expected physiological range, elevated EU in vivo suggests a mismatch with real acquisition conditions, highlighting the importance of incorporating EU, which was allowed by DE. Overall, we present a comprehensive framework for IVIM fitting with uncertainty quantification, which enables the identification and interpretation of unreliable estimates. The proposed approach can also be adopted for fitting other physical models through appropriate architectural and simulation adjustments.</description>

      <title>Algebraically Observable Physics-Informed Neural Network and its Application to Epidemiological Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is a deep learning framework that integrates the governing equations underlying data into a loss function. In this study, we consider the problem of estimating state variables and parameters in epidemiological models governed by ordinary differential equations using PINNs. In practice, not all trajectory data corresponding to the population described by models can be measured. Learning PINNs to estimate the unmeasured state variables and epidemiological parameters using partial measurements is challenging.
  Accordingly, we introduce the concept of algebraic observability of the state variables. Specifically, we propose augmenting the unmeasured data based on algebraic observability analysis. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments under three scenarios in the context of epidemiological modelling. Specifically, given noisy and partial measurements, the accuracy of unmeasured states and parameter estimation of the proposed method is shown to be higher than that of the conventional methods. The proposed method is also shown to be effective in practical scenarios, such as when the data corresponding to certain variables cannot be reconstructed from the measurements.</description>

      <title>A Reproducible, Scalable Pipeline for Synthesizing Autoregressive Model Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accelerating pace of research on autoregressive generative models has produced thousands of papers, making manual literature surveys and reproduction studies increasingly impractical. We present a fully open-source, reproducible pipeline that automatically retrieves candidate documents from public repositories, filters them for relevance, extracts metadata, hyper-parameters and reported results, clusters topics, produces retrieval-augmented summaries and generates containerised scripts for re-running selected experiments. Quantitative evaluation on 50 manually-annotated papers shows F1 scores above 0.85 for relevance classification, hyper-parameter extraction and citation identification. Experiments on corpora of up to 1000 papers demonstrate near-linear scalability with eight CPU workers. Three case studies -- AWD-LSTM on WikiText-2, Transformer-XL on WikiText-103 and an autoregressive music model on the Lakh MIDI dataset -- confirm that the extracted settings support faithful reproduction, achieving test perplexities within 1--3% of the original reports.</description>

      <title>Accept-Reject Lasso</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lasso method is known to exhibit instability in the presence of highly correlated features, often leading to an arbitrary selection of predictors. This issue manifests itself in two primary error types: the erroneous omission of features that lack a true substitutable relationship (falsely redundant features) and the inclusion of features with a true substitutable relationship (truly redundant features). Although most existing methods address only one of these challenges, we introduce the Accept-Reject Lasso (ARL), a novel approach that resolves this dilemma. ARL operationalizes an Accept-Reject framework through a fine-grained analysis of feature selection across data subsets. This framework is designed to partition the output of an ensemble method into beneficial and detrimental components through fine-grained analysis. The fundamental challenge for Lasso is that inter-variable correlation obscures the true sources of information. ARL tackles this by first using clustering to identify distinct subset structures within the data. It then analyzes Lasso's behavior across these subsets to differentiate between true and spurious correlations. For truly correlated features, which induce multicollinearity, ARL tends to select a single representative feature and reject the rest to ensure model stability. Conversely, for features linked by spurious correlations, which may vanish in certain subsets, ARL accepts those that Lasso might have incorrectly omitted. The distinct patterns arising from true versus spurious correlations create a divisible separation. By setting an appropriate threshold, our framework can effectively distinguish between these two phenomena, thereby maximizing the inclusion of informative variables while minimizing the introduction of detrimental ones. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method through extensive simulation and real-data experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of generative models for music called live music models that produce a continuous stream of music in real-time with synchronized user control. We release Magenta RealTime, an open-weights live music model that can be steered using text or audio prompts to control acoustic style. On automatic metrics of music quality, Magenta RealTime outperforms other open-weights music generation models, despite using fewer parameters and offering first-of-its-kind live generation capabilities. We also release Lyria RealTime, an API-based model with extended controls, offering access to our most powerful model with wide prompt coverage. These models demonstrate a new paradigm for AI-assisted music creation that emphasizes human-in-the-loop interaction for live music performance.</description>

      <title>Sculptor: Empowering LLMs with Cognitive Agency via Active Context Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from significant performance degradation when processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant information in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory recall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs' capabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active Context Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working memory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore, and (3) intelligent search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental evaluation on information-sparse benchmarks-PI-LLM (proactive interference) and NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning-demonstrates that Sculptor significantly improves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent tool calling generalization capabilities. By enabling Active Context Management, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also provides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse long-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies, rather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale.</description>

      <title>GeRe: Towards Efficient Anti-Forgetting in Continual Learning of LLM via General Samples Replay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for advancing artificial general intelligence. However, continual fine-tuning LLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting, characterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and 2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously address both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample Replay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient anti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices under GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced activation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin (TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning. We are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general replay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general capabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks. Indeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled experiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies under the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via KL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that TM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work paves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Qznan/GeRe.</description>

      <title>Query Attribute Modeling: Improving search relevance with Semantic Search and Meta Data Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces Query Attribute Modeling (QAM), a hybrid framework that enhances search precision and relevance by decomposing open text queries into structured metadata tags and semantic elements. QAM addresses traditional search limitations by automatically extracting metadata filters from free-form text queries, reducing noise and enabling focused retrieval of relevant items.
  Experimental evaluation using the Amazon Toys Reviews dataset (10,000 unique items with 40,000+ reviews and detailed product attributes) demonstrated QAM's superior performance, achieving a mean average precision at 5 (mAP@5) of 52.99\%. This represents significant improvement over conventional methods, including BM25 keyword search, encoder-based semantic similarity search, cross-encoder re-ranking, and hybrid search combining BM25 and semantic results via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). The results establish QAM as a robust solution for Enterprise Search applications, particularly in e-commerce systems.</description>

      <title>SEAgent: Self-Evolving Computer Use Agent with Autonomous Learning from Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents (CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software, particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge, we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software. Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks. The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores learned-context neural networks. It is a multi-task learning architecture based on a fully shared neural network and an augmented input vector containing trainable task parameters. The architecture is interesting due to its powerful task adaption mechanism, which facilitates a low-dimensional task parameter space. Theoretically, we show that a scalar task parameter is sufficient for universal approximation of all tasks, which is not necessarily the case for more common architectures. Empirically it is shown that, for homogeneous tasks, the dimension of the task parameter may vary with the complexity of the tasks, but a small task parameter space is generally viable. The task parameter space is found to be well-behaved, which simplifies workflows related to updating models as new data arrives, and learning new tasks with the shared parameters are frozen. Additionally, the architecture displays robustness towards datasets where tasks have few data points. The architecture's performance is compared to similar neural network architectures on ten datasets, with competitive results.</description>

      <title>From Cluster Assumption to Graph Convolution: Graph-based Semi-Supervised Learning Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) has long been a hot research topic. Traditional methods are generally shallow learners, based on the cluster assumption. Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have become the predominant techniques for their promising performance. In this paper, we theoretically discuss the relationship between these two types of methods in a unified optimization framework. One of the most intriguing findings is that, unlike traditional ones, typical GCNs may not jointly consider the graph structure and label information at each layer. Motivated by this, we further propose three simple but powerful graph convolution methods. The first is a supervised method OGC which guides the graph convolution process with labels. The others are two unsupervised methods: GGC and its multi-scale version GGCM, both aiming to preserve the graph structure information during the convolution process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to show the effectiveness of our methods. Code is available at https://github.com/zhengwang100/ogc_ggcm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05179v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in reinforcement learning (RL) is that the agent has to make decisions that would influence the future performance without having complete knowledge of the environment. Dynamically adjusting the level of epistemic risk during the learning process can help to achieve reliable policies in safety-critical settings with better efficiency. In this work, we propose a new framework, Distributional RL with Online Risk Adaptation (DRL-ORA). This framework quantifies both epistemic and implicit aleatory uncertainties in a unified manner and dynamically adjusts the epistemic risk levels by solving a total variation minimization problem online. The framework unifies the existing variants of risk adaption approaches and offers better explainability and flexibility. The selection of risk levels is performed efficiently via a grid search using a Follow-The-Leader-type algorithm, where the offline oracle also corresponds to a ''satisficing measure'' under a specially modified loss function. We show that DRL-ORA outperforms existing methods that rely on fixed risk levels or manually designed risk level adaptation in multiple classes of tasks.</description>

Abstract: Early Exit Neural Networks (EENNs) endow astandard Deep Neural Network (DNN) with Early Exit Classifiers (EECs), to provide predictions at intermediate points of the processing when enough confidence in classification is achieved. This leads to many benefits in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Currently, the design of EENNs is carried out manually by experts, a complex and time-consuming task that requires accounting for many aspects, including the correct placement, the thresholding, and the computational overhead of the EECs. For this reason, the research is exploring the use of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to automatize the design of EENNs. Currently, few comprehensive NAS solutions for EENNs have been proposed in the literature, and a fully automated, joint design strategy taking into consideration both the backbone and the EECs remains an open problem. To this end, this work presents Neural Architecture Search for Hardware Constrained Early Exit Neural Networks (NACHOS), the first NAS framework for the design of optimal EENNs satisfying constraints on the accuracy and the number of Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) operations performed by the EENNs at inference time. In particular, this provides the joint design of backbone and EECs to select a set of admissible (i.e., respecting the constraints) Pareto Optimal Solutions in terms of best tradeoff between the accuracy and number of MACs. The results show that the models designed by NACHOS are competitive with the state-of-the-art EENNs. Additionally, this work investigates the effectiveness of two novel regularization terms designed for the optimization of the auxiliary classifiers of the EENN</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03055v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for continuous control under delayed rewards is an under-explored problem despite its significance in real-world applications. Many complex skills are based on intermediate ones as prerequisites. For instance, a humanoid locomotor must learn how to stand before it can learn to walk. To cope with delayed reward, an agent must perform deep exploration. However, existing deep exploration methods are designed for small discrete action spaces, and their generalization to state-of-the-art continuous control remains unproven. We address the deep exploration problem for the first time from a PAC-Bayesian perspective in the context of actor-critic learning. To do this, we quantify the error of the Bellman operator through a PAC-Bayes bound, where a bootstrapped ensemble of critic networks represents the posterior distribution, and their targets serve as a data-informed function-space prior. We derive an objective function from this bound and use it to train the critic ensemble. Each critic trains an individual soft actor network, implemented as a shared trunk and critic-specific heads. The agent performs deep exploration by acting epsilon-softly on a randomly chosen actor head. Our proposed algorithm, named {\it PAC-Bayesian Actor-Critic (PBAC)}, is the only algorithm to consistently discover delayed rewards on continuous control tasks with varying difficulty.</description>

      <title>Time Evidence Fusion Network: Multi-source View in Long-Term Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06419v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In practical scenarios, time series forecasting necessitates not only accuracy but also efficiency. Consequently, the exploration of model architectures remains a perennially trending topic in research. To address these challenges, we propose a novel backbone architecture named Time Evidence Fusion Network (TEFN) from the perspective of information fusion. Specifically, we introduce the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) Module based on evidence theory to capture the uncertainty of multivariate time series data from both channel and time dimensions. Additionally, we develop a novel multi-source information fusion method to effectively integrate the two distinct dimensions from BPA output, leading to improved forecasting accuracy. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that TEFN achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining significantly lower complexity and reduced training time. Also, our experiments show that TEFN exhibits high robustness, with minimal error fluctuations during hyperparameter selection. Furthermore, due to the fact that BPA is derived from fuzzy theory, TEFN offers a high degree of interpretability. Therefore, the proposed TEFN balances accuracy, efficiency, stability, and interpretability, making it a desirable solution for time series forecasting.</description>

      <title>Basis Selection: Low-Rank Decomposition of Pretrained Large Language Models for Target Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) significantly enhance the performance of various applications, but they are computationally intensive and energy-demanding. This makes it challenging to deploy them on devices with limited resources, such as personal computers and mobile/wearable devices, and results in substantial inference costs in resource-rich environments like cloud servers. To extend the use of LLMs, we introduce a low-rank decomposition approach to effectively compress these models, tailored to the requirements of specific applications. We observe that LLMs pretrained on general datasets contain many redundant components not needed for particular applications. Our method focuses on identifying and removing these redundant parts, retaining only the necessary elements for the target applications. Specifically, we represent the weight matrices of LLMs as a linear combination of base components. We then prune the irrelevant bases and enhance the model with new bases beneficial for specific applications. Deep compression results on the Llama 2-7b and -13B models, conducted on target applications including mathematical reasoning and code generation, show that our method significantly reduces model size while maintaining comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art low-rank compression techniques.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Controllable Learning: Methods and Applications in Information Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controllability has become a crucial aspect of trustworthy machine learning, enabling learners to meet predefined targets and adapt dynamically at test time without requiring retraining as the targets shift. We provide a formal definition of controllable learning (CL), and discuss its applications in information retrieval (IR) where information needs are often complex and dynamic. The survey categorizes CL according to what is controllable (e.g., multiple objectives, user portrait, scenario adaptation), who controls (users or platforms), how control is implemented (e.g., rule-based method, Pareto optimization, hypernetwork and others), and where to implement control (e.g., pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing methods). Then, we identify challenges faced by CL across training, evaluation, task setting, and deployment in online environments. Additionally, we outline promising directions for CL in theoretical analysis, efficient computation, empowering large language models, application scenarios and evaluation frameworks.</description>

      <title>Random Erasing vs. Model Inversion: A Promising Defense or a False Hope?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model Inversion (MI) attacks pose a significant privacy threat by reconstructing private training data from machine learning models. While existing defenses primarily concentrate on model-centric approaches, the impact of data on MI robustness remains largely unexplored. In this work, we explore Random Erasing (RE), a technique traditionally used for improving model generalization under occlusion, and uncover its surprising effectiveness as a defense against MI attacks. Specifically, our novel feature space analysis shows that models trained with RE-images introduce a significant discrepancy between the features of MI-reconstructed images and those of the private data. At the same time, features of private images remain distinct from other classes and well-separated from different classification regions. These effects collectively degrade MI reconstruction quality and attack accuracy while maintaining reasonable natural accuracy. Furthermore, we explore two critical properties of RE including Partial Erasure and Random Location. Partial Erasure prevents the model from observing entire objects during training. We find this has a significant impact on MI, which aims to reconstruct the entire objects. Random Location of erasure plays a crucial role in achieving a strong privacy-utility trade-off. Our findings highlight RE as a simple yet effective defense mechanism that can be easily integrated with existing privacy-preserving techniques. Extensive experiments across 37 setups demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the privacy-utility trade-off. The results consistently demonstrate the superiority of our defense over existing methods across different MI attacks, network architectures, and attack configurations. For the first time, we achieve a significant degradation in attack accuracy without a decrease in utility for some configurations.</description>

      <title>One Model, Any Conjunctive Query: Graph Neural Networks for Answering Queries over Incomplete Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the incompleteness of modern knowledge graphs, a new setup for query answering has emerged, where the goal is to predict answers that do not necessarily appear in the knowledge graph, but are present in its completion. In this paper, we formally introduce and study two query answering problems, namely, query answer classification and query answer retrieval. To solve these problems, we propose AnyCQ, a model that can classify answers to any conjunctive query on any knowledge graph. At the core of our framework lies a graph neural network trained using a reinforcement learning objective to answer Boolean queries. Trained only on simple, small instances, AnyCQ generalizes to large queries of arbitrary structure, reliably classifying and retrieving answers to queries that existing approaches fail to handle. This is empirically validated through our newly proposed, challenging benchmarks. Finally, we empirically show that AnyCQ can effectively transfer to completely novel knowledge graphs when equipped with an appropriate link prediction model, highlighting its potential for querying incomplete data.</description>

      <title>Beyond Adapter Retrieval: Latent Geometry-Preserving Composition via Sparse Task Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in parameter-efficient transfer learning have demonstrated the utility of composing LoRA adapters from libraries of pretrained modules. However, most existing approaches rely on simple retrieval heuristics or uniform averaging, which overlook the latent structure of task relationships in representation space. We propose a new framework for adapter reuse that moves beyond retrieval, formulating adapter composition as a geometry-aware sparse reconstruction problem. Specifically, we represent each task by a latent prototype vector derived from the base model's encoder and aim to approximate the target task prototype as a sparse linear combination of retrieved reference prototypes, under an $\ell_1$-regularized optimization objective. The resulting combination weights are then used to blend the corresponding LoRA adapters, yielding a composite adapter tailored to the target task. This formulation not only preserves the local geometric structure of the task representation manifold, but also promotes interpretability and efficient reuse by selecting a minimal set of relevant adapters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple domains-including medical image segmentation, medical report generation and image synthesis. Our results highlight the benefit of coupling retrieval with latent geometry-aware optimization for improved zero-shot generalization.</description>

      <title>PAK-UCB Contextual Bandit: An Online Learning Approach to Prompt-Aware Selection of Generative Models and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13287v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Selecting a sample generation scheme from multiple prompt-based generative models, including large language models (LLMs) and prompt-guided image and video generation models, is typically addressed by choosing the model that maximizes an averaged evaluation score. However, this score-based selection overlooks the possibility that different models achieve the best generation performance for different types of text prompts. An online identification of the best generation model for various input prompts can reduce the costs associated with querying sub-optimal models. In this work, we explore the possibility of varying rankings of text-based generative models for different text prompts and propose an online learning framework to predict the best data generation model for a given input prompt. The proposed PAK-UCB algorithm addresses a contextual bandit (CB) setting with shared context variables across the arms, utilizing the generated data to update kernel-based functions that predict the score of each model available for unseen text prompts. Additionally, we leverage random Fourier features (RFF) to accelerate the online learning process of PAK-UCB. Our numerical experiments on real and simulated text-to-image and image-to-text generative models show that RFF-UCB performs successfully in identifying the best generation model across different sample types.

      <title>Automatically Interpreting Millions of Features in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13928v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the activations of neurons in deep neural networks usually do not have a simple human-understandable interpretation, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) can be used to transform these activations into a higher-dimensional latent space which may be more easily interpretable. However, these SAEs can have millions of distinct latent features, making it infeasible for humans to manually interpret each one. In this work, we build an open-source automated pipeline to generate and evaluate natural language explanations for SAE features using LLMs. We test our framework on SAEs of varying sizes, activation functions, and losses, trained on two different open-weight LLMs. We introduce five new techniques to score the quality of explanations that are cheaper to run than the previous state of the art. One of these techniques, intervention scoring, evaluates the interpretability of the effects of intervening on a feature, which we find explains features that are not recalled by existing methods. We propose guidelines for generating better explanations that remain valid for a broader set of activating contexts, and discuss pitfalls with existing scoring techniques. We use our explanations to measure the semantic similarity of independently trained SAEs, and find that SAEs trained on nearby layers of the residual stream are highly similar. Our large-scale analysis confirms that SAE latents are indeed much more interpretable than neurons, even when neurons are sparsified using top-$k$ postprocessing. Our code is available at https://github.com/EleutherAI/sae-auto-interp, and our explanations are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/EleutherAI/auto_interp_explanations.</description>

      <title>Dual-Label Learning With Irregularly Present Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multi-task learning, labels are often missing irregularly across samples, which can be fully labeled, partially labeled or unlabeled. The irregular label presence often appears in scientific studies due to experimental limitations. It triggers a demand for a new training and inference mechanism that could accommodate irregularly present labels and maximize their utility. This work focuses on the two-label learning task and proposes a novel training and inference framework, Dual-Label Learning (DLL). The DLL framework formulates the problem into a dual-function system, in which the two functions should simultaneously satisfy standard supervision, structural duality and probabilistic duality. DLL features a dual-tower model architecture that allows for explicit information exchange between labels, aimed at maximizing the utility of partially available labels. During training, missing labels are imputed as part of the forward propagation process, while during inference, labels are predicted jointly as unknowns of a bivariate system of equations. Our theoretical analysis guarantees the feasibility of DLL, and extensive experiments are conducted to verify that by explicitly modeling label correlation and maximizing label utility, our method makes consistently better prediction than baseline approaches by up to 9.6% gain in F1-score or 10.2% reduction in MAPE. Remarkably, DLL maintains robust performance at a label missing rate of up to 60%, achieving even better results than baseline approaches at lower missing rates down to only 10%.</description>

      <title>Understanding In-Context Learning of Linear Models in Transformers Through an Adversarial Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we make two contributions towards understanding of in-context learning of linear models by transformers. First, we investigate the adversarial robustness of in-context learning in transformers to hijacking attacks -- a type of adversarial attacks in which the adversary's goal is to manipulate the prompt to force the transformer to generate a specific output. We show that both linear transformers and transformers with GPT-2 architectures are vulnerable to such hijacking attacks. However, adversarial robustness to such attacks can be significantly improved through adversarial training -- done either at the pretraining or finetuning stage -- and can generalize to stronger attack models. Our second main contribution is a comparative analysis of adversarial vulnerabilities across transformer models and other algorithms for learning linear models. This reveals two novel findings. First, adversarial attacks transfer poorly between larger transformer models trained from different seeds despite achieving similar in-distribution performance. This suggests that transformers of the same architecture trained according to the same recipe may implement different in-context learning algorithms for the same task. Second, we observe that attacks do not transfer well between classical learning algorithms for linear models (single-step gradient descent and ordinary least squares) and transformers. This suggests that there could be qualitative differences between the in-context learning algorithms that transformers implement and these traditional algorithms.</description>

      <title>Efficient Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Regression for Spatial-Temporal Sensor Fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing deployment of low-cost, distributed sensor networks in environmental and biomedical domains has enabled continuous, large-scale health monitoring. However, these systems often face challenges related to degraded data quality caused by sensor drift, noise, and insufficient calibration -- factors that limit their reliability in real-world applications. Traditional machine learning methods for sensor fusion and calibration rely on extensive feature engineering and struggle to capture spatial-temporal dependencies or adapt to distribution shifts across varying deployment conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method tailored for regression tasks. Our proposed method integrates effectively with Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks and leverages the alignment of perturbed inverse Gram matrices between source and target domains, drawing inspiration from Tikhonov regularization. This approach enables scalable and efficient domain adaptation without requiring labeled data in the target domain. We validate our novel method on real-world datasets from two distinct applications: air quality monitoring and EEG signal reconstruction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance which paves the way for more robust and transferable sensor fusion models in both environmental and physiological contexts. Our code is available at https://github.com/EPFL-IMOS/TikUDA.</description>

      <title>Ultra Memory-Efficient On-FPGA Training of Transformers via Tensor-Compressed Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of machine learning tasks. There is growing interest in training transformers on resource-constrained edge devices due to considerations such as privacy, domain adaptation, and on-device scientific machine learning. However, the significant computational and memory demands required for transformer training often exceed the capabilities of an edge device. Leveraging low-rank tensor compression, this paper presents the first on-FPGA accelerator for end-to-end transformer training. On the algorithm side, we present a bi-directional contraction flow for tensorized transformer training, significantly reducing the computational FLOPS and intra-layer memory costs compared to existing tensor operations. On the hardware side, we store all highly compressed model parameters and gradient information on chip, creating an on-chip-memory-only framework for each stage in training. This reduces off-chip communication and minimizes latency and energy costs. Additionally, we implement custom computing kernels for each training stage and employ intra-layer parallelism and pipe-lining to further enhance run-time and memory efficiency. Through experiments on transformer models within $36.7$ to $93.5$ MB using FP-32 data formats on the ATIS dataset, our tensorized FPGA accelerator could conduct single-batch end-to-end training on the AMD Alevo U50 FPGA, with a memory budget of less than $6$-MB BRAM and $22.5$-MB URAM. Compared to uncompressed training on the NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, our on-FPGA training achieves a memory reduction of $30\times$ to $51\times$. Our FPGA accelerator also achieves up to $3.6\times$ less energy cost per epoch compared with tensor Transformer training on an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU.</description>

Abstract: Many modern deep learning applications require balancing multiple objectives that are often conflicting. Examples include multi-task learning, fairness-aware learning, and the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). This leads to multi-objective deep learning, which tries to find optimal trade-offs or Pareto-optimal solutions by adapting mathematical principles from the field of Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO). However, directly applying gradient-based MOO techniques to deep neural networks presents unique challenges, including high computational costs, optimization instability, and the difficulty of effectively incorporating user preferences. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of gradient-based techniques for multi-objective deep learning. We systematically categorize existing algorithms based on their outputs: (i) methods that find a single, well-balanced solution, (ii) methods that generate a finite set of diverse Pareto-optimal solutions, and (iii) methods that learn a continuous Pareto set of solutions. In addition to this taxonomy, the survey covers theoretical analyses, key applications, practical resources, and highlights open challenges and promising directions for future research. A comprehensive list of multi-objective deep learning algorithms is available at https://github.com/Baijiong-Lin/Awesome-Multi-Objective-Deep-Learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many scientific problems involve data that is embedded in a space with periodic boundary conditions. This can for instance be related to an inherent cyclic or rotational symmetry in the data or a spatially extended periodicity. When analyzing such data, well-tailored methods are needed to obtain efficient approaches that obey the periodic boundary conditions of the problem. In this work, we present a method for applying a clustering algorithm to data embedded in a periodic domain based on the DBSCAN algorithm, a widely used unsupervised machine learning method that identifies clusters in data. The proposed method internally leverages the conventional DBSCAN algorithm for domains with open boundaries, such that it remains compatible with all optimized implementations for neighborhood searches in open domains. In this way, it retains the same optimized runtime complexity of $O(N\log N)$. We demonstrate the workings of the proposed method using synthetic data in one, two and three dimensions and also apply it to a real-world example involving the clustering of bubbles in a turbulent flow. The proposed approach is implemented in a ready-to-use Python package that we make publicly available.</description>

      <title>Tool Unlearning for Tool-Augmented LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are often trained on datasets of query-response pairs, which embed the ability to use tools or APIs directly into the parametric knowledge of LLMs. Tool-augmented LLMs need the ability to forget learned tools due to security vulnerabilities, privacy regulations, or tool deprecations. However, ``tool unlearning'' has not been investigated in unlearning literature. We introduce this novel task, which requires addressing distinct challenges compared to traditional unlearning: knowledge removal rather than forgetting individual samples, the high cost of optimizing LLMs, and the need for principled evaluation metrics. To bridge these gaps, we propose ToolDelete, the first approach for unlearning tools from tool-augmented LLMs. It implements three key properties to address the above challenges for effective tool unlearning and introduces a new membership inference attack (MIA) model for effective evaluation. Extensive experiments on multiple tool learning datasets and tool-augmented LLMs show that ToolDelete effectively unlearns randomly selected tools, while preserving the LLM's knowledge on non-deleted tools and maintaining performance on general tasks.</description>

      <title>Foundation Model of Electronic Medical Records for Adaptive Risk Estimation</title>

Abstract: Hospitals struggle to predict critical outcomes. Traditional early warning systems, like NEWS and MEWS, rely on static variables and fixed thresholds, limiting their adaptability, accuracy, and personalization. We previously developed the Enhanced Transformer for Health Outcome Simulation (ETHOS), an AI model that tokenizes patient health timelines (PHTs) from EHRs and uses transformer-based architectures to predict future PHTs. ETHOS is a versatile framework for developing a wide range of applications. In this work, we develop the Adaptive Risk Estimation System (ARES) that leverages ETHOS to compute dynamic, personalized risk probabilities for clinician-defined critical events. ARES also features a personalized explainability module that highlights key clinical factors influencing risk estimates. We evaluated ARES using the MIMIC-IV v2.2 dataset together with its Emergency Department (ED) extension and benchmarked performance against both classical early warning systems and contemporary machine learning models. The entire dataset was tokenized resulting in 285,622 PHTs, comprising over 360 million tokens. ETHOS outperformed benchmark models in predicting hospital admissions, ICU admissions, and prolonged stays, achieving superior AUC scores. Its risk estimates were robust across demographic subgroups, with calibration curves confirming model reliability. The explainability module provided valuable insights into patient-specific risk factors. ARES, powered by ETHOS, advances predictive healthcare AI by delivering dynamic, real-time, personalized risk estimation with patient-specific explainability. Although our results are promising, the clinical impact remains uncertain. Demonstrating ARES's true utility in real-world settings will be the focus of our future work. We release the source code to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>PTQ1.61: Push the Real Limit of Extremely Low-Bit Post-Training Quantization Methods for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer severe performance degradation when facing extremely low-bit (sub 2-bit) quantization. Several existing sub 2-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) methods utilize a mix-precision scheme by leveraging an unstructured fine-grained mask to explicitly distinguish salient weights, while which introduces an extra 1-bit or more per weight. To explore the real limit of PTQ, we propose an extremely low-bit PTQ method called PTQ1.61, which enables weight quantization to 1.61-bit for the first time. Specifically, we first introduce a one-dimensional structured mask with negligibly additional 0.0002-bit per weight based on input activations from the perspective of reducing the upper bound of quantization error to allocate corresponding salient weight channels to 4-bit. For non-salient channels binarization, an efficient block-wise scaling factors optimization framework is then presented to take implicit row-wise correlations and angular biases into account. Different from prior works that concentrate on adjusting quantization methodologies, we further propose a novel paradigm called quantization preprocessing, where we argue that transforming the weight distribution of the pretrained model before quantization can alleviate the difficulty in per-channel extremely low-bit PTQ. Extensive experiments indicate our PTQ1.61 achieves state-of-the-art performance in extremely low-bit quantization. Codes are available at https://github.com/zjq0455/PTQ1.61.</description>

      <title>UltraSTF: Ultra-Compact Model for Large-Scale Spatio-Temporal Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal data, prevalent in real-world applications such as traffic monitoring, financial transactions, and ride-share demands, represents a specialized case of multivariate time series characterized by high dimensionality. This high dimensionality necessitates computationally efficient models and benefits from applying univariate forecasting approaches through channel-independent strategies. SparseTSF, a recently proposed competitive univariate forecasting model, leverages periodicity to achieve compactness by focusing on cross-period dynamics, extending the Pareto frontier in terms of model size and predictive performance. However, it underperforms on spatio-temporal data due to limited capture of intra-period temporal dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose UltraSTF, which integrates a cross-period forecasting component with an ultra-compact shape bank component. Our model efficiently captures recurring patterns in time series using the attention mechanism of the shape bank component, significantly enhancing its capability to learn intra-period dynamics. UltraSTF achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LargeST benchmark while utilizing fewer than 0.2% of the parameters required by the second-best methods, thereby further extending the Pareto frontier of existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Learning richness modulates equality reasoning in neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equality reasoning is ubiquitous and purely abstract: sameness or difference may be evaluated no matter the nature of the underlying objects. As a result, same-different (SD) tasks have been extensively studied as a starting point for understanding abstract reasoning in humans and across animal species. With the rise of neural networks that exhibit striking apparent proficiency for abstractions, equality reasoning in these models has also gained interest. Yet despite extensive study, conclusions about equality reasoning vary widely and with little consensus. To clarify the underlying principles in learning SD tasks, we develop a theory of equality reasoning in multi-layer perceptrons (MLP). Following observations in comparative psychology, we propose a spectrum of behavior that ranges from conceptual to perceptual outcomes. Conceptual behavior is characterized by task-specific representations, efficient learning, and insensitivity to spurious perceptual details. Perceptual behavior is characterized by strong sensitivity to spurious perceptual details, accompanied by the need for exhaustive training to learn the task. We develop a mathematical theory to show that an MLP's behavior is driven by learning richness. Rich-regime MLPs exhibit conceptual behavior, whereas lazy-regime MLPs exhibit perceptual behavior. We validate our theoretical findings in vision SD experiments, showing that rich feature learning promotes success by encouraging hallmarks of conceptual behavior. Overall, our work identifies feature learning richness as a key parameter modulating equality reasoning, and suggests that equality reasoning in humans and animals may similarly depend on learning richness in neural circuits.</description>

      <title>SimpleRL-Zoo: Investigating and Taming Zero Reinforcement Learning for Open Base Models in the Wild</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18892v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can naturally emerge through a simple reinforcement learning (RL) framework with rule-based rewards, where the training may directly start from the base models-a paradigm referred to as zero RL training. Most recent efforts to reproduce zero RL training have primarily focused on the Qwen2.5 model series, which may not be representative as we find the base models already exhibit strong instruction-following and self-reflection abilities. In this work, we investigate zero RL training across 10 diverse base models, spanning different families and sizes including LLama3-8B, Mistral-7B/24B, DeepSeek-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-math-7B, and all Qwen2.5 models from 0.5B to 32B. Leveraging several key design strategies-such as adjusting format reward and controlling query difficulty-we achieve substantial improvements in both reasoning accuracy and response length across most settings. However, by carefully monitoring the training dynamics, we observe that different base models exhibit distinct patterns during training. For instance, the increased response length does not always correlate with the emergence of certain cognitive behaviors such as verification (i.e., the "aha moment"). Notably, we observe the "aha moment" for the first time in small models not from the Qwen family. We share the key designs that enable successful zero RL training, along with our findings and practices. To facilitate further research, we open-source the code, models, and analysis tools.</description>

      <title>Risk-Based Thresholding for Reliable Anomaly Detection in Concentrated Solar Power Plants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and reliable operation of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants is essential for meeting the growing demand for sustainable energy. However, high-temperature solar receivers face severe operational risks, such as freezing, deformation, and corrosion, resulting in costly downtime and maintenance. To monitor CSP plants, cameras mounted on solar receivers record infrared images at irregular intervals ranging from one to five minutes throughout the day. Anomalous images can be detected by thresholding an anomaly score, where the threshold is chosen to optimize metrics such as the F1-score on a validation set. This work proposes a framework, using risk control, for generating more reliable decision thresholds with finite-sample coverage guarantees on any chosen risk function. Our framework also incorporates an abstention mechanism, allowing high-risk predictions to be deferred to domain experts. Second, we propose a density forecasting method to estimate the likelihood of an observed image given a sequence of previously observed images, using this likelihood as its anomaly score. Third, we analyze the deployment results of our framework across multiple training scenarios over several months for two CSP plants. This analysis provides valuable insights to our industry partner for optimizing maintenance operations. Finally, given the confidential nature of our dataset, we provide an extended simulated dataset, leveraging recent advancements in generative modeling to create diverse thermal images that simulate multiple CSP plants. Our code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>CITRAS: Covariate-Informed Transformer for Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In practical time series forecasting, covariates provide rich contextual information that can potentially enhance the forecast of target variables. Although some covariates extend into the future forecasting horizon (e.g., calendar events, discount schedules), most multivariate models fail to leverage this pivotal insight due to the length discrepancy with target variables. Additionally, capturing the dependency between target variables and covariates is non-trivial, as models must precisely reflect the local impact of covariates while also capturing global cross-variate dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we propose CITRAS, a decoder-only Transformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets, past covariates, and future covariates. While preserving strong autoregressive capabilities, CITRAS introduces two novel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift and Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future covariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent dependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing refines locally accurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level dependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally, CITRAS outperforms state-of-the-art models on thirteen real-world benchmarks from both covariate-informed and multivariate settings, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage cross-variate and cross-time dependencies for improved forecasting accuracy.</description>

      <title>ProtoECGNet: Case-Based Interpretable Deep Learning for Multi-Label ECG Classification with Contrastive Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08713v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based electrocardiogram (ECG) classification has shown impressive performance but clinical adoption has been slowed by the lack of transparent and faithful explanations. Post hoc methods such as saliency maps may fail to reflect a model's true decision process. Prototype-based reasoning offers a more transparent alternative by grounding decisions in similarity to learned representations of real ECG segments, enabling faithful, case-based explanations. We introduce ProtoECGNet, a prototype-based deep learning model for interpretable, multi-label ECG classification. ProtoECGNet employs a structured, multi-branch architecture that reflects clinical interpretation workflows: it integrates a 1D CNN with global prototypes for rhythm classification, a 2D CNN with time-localized prototypes for morphology-based reasoning, and a 2D CNN with global prototypes for diffuse abnormalities. Each branch is trained with a prototype loss designed for multi-label learning, combining clustering, separation, diversity, and a novel contrastive loss that encourages appropriate separation between prototypes of unrelated classes while allowing clustering for frequently co-occurring diagnoses. We evaluate ProtoECGNet on all 71 diagnostic labels from the PTB-XL dataset, demonstrating competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art black-box models while providing structured, case-based explanations. To assess prototype quality, we conduct a structured clinician review of the final model's projected prototypes, finding that they are rated as representative and clear. ProtoECGNet shows that prototype learning can be effectively scaled to complex, multi-label time-series classification, offering a practical path toward transparent and trustworthy deep learning models for clinical decision support.</description>

      <title>GenEDA: Towards Generative Netlist Functional Reasoning via Cross-Modal Circuit Encoder-Decoder Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of foundation AI has motivated the research of circuit foundation models, which are customized to assist the integrated circuit (IC) design process. However, existing pre-trained circuit foundation models are typically limited to standalone encoders for predictive tasks or decoders for generative tasks. These two model types are developed independently, operate on different circuit modalities, and reside in separate latent spaces. This restricts their ability to complement each other for more advanced capabilities. In this work, we present GenEDA, the first framework that cross-modally aligns circuit encoders with decoders within a shared latent space. GenEDA bridges the gap between graph-based circuit representation learning and text-based large language models (LLMs), enabling communication between their respective latent spaces. To achieve the alignment, we propose two paradigms to support both open-source trainable LLMs and commercial frozen LLMs. We leverage this aligned architecture to develop the first generative foundation model for netlists, unleashing LLMs' generative reasoning capability on the low-level and bit-blasted netlists. GenEDA enables three unprecedented generative netlist functional reasoning tasks, where it reversely generates high-level functionalities such as specifications and RTL code from low-level netlists. These tasks move beyond traditional gate function classification to direct generation of full-circuit functionality. Experiments demonstrate that GenEDA significantly boosts advanced LLMs' (e.g., GPT and DeepSeek series) performance in all tasks.</description>

      <title>Let the Void Be Void: Robust Open-Set Semi-Supervised Learning via Selective Non-Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-set semi-supervised learning (OSSL) leverages unlabeled data containing both in-distribution (ID) and unknown out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, aiming simultaneously to improve closed-set accuracy and detect novel OOD instances. Existing methods either discard valuable information from uncertain samples or force-align every unlabeled sample into one or a few synthetic "catch-all" representations, resulting in geometric collapse and overconfidence on only seen OODs. To address the limitations, we introduce selective non-alignment, adding a novel "skip" operator into conventional pull and push operations of contrastive learning. Our framework, SkipAlign, selectively skips alignment (pulling) for low-confidence unlabeled samples, retaining only gentle repulsion against ID prototypes. This approach transforms uncertain samples into a pure repulsion signal, resulting in tighter ID clusters and naturally dispersed OOD features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkipAlign significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting unseen OOD data without sacrificing ID classification accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold superposition theorem, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as an improved backbone for most deep learning frameworks, promising more adaptivity than their multilayer perceptron (MLP) predecessor by allowing for trainable spline-based activation functions. In this paper, we probe the theoretical foundations of the KAN architecture by showing that it can optimally approximate any Besov function in $B^{s}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$ on a bounded open, or even fractal, domain $\mathcal{X}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ at the optimal approximation rate with respect to any weaker Besov norm $B^{\alpha}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$; where $\alpha &lt; s$. We complement our approximation result with a statistical guarantee by bounding the pseudodimension of the relevant class of Res-KANs. As an application of the latter, we directly deduce a dimension-free estimate on the sample complexity of a residual KAN model when learning a function of Besov regularity from $N$ i.i.d. noiseless samples, showing that KANs can learn the smooth maps which they can approximate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI-based weather forecasting models, such as FourCastNet, Pangu-Weather, and GraphCast, have demonstrated the remarkable ability of deep learning to emulate complex atmospheric dynamics. Building on this momentum, we propose Mj\"olnir, a novel deep learning-based framework for global lightning flash density parameterization. Trained on ERA5 atmospheric predictors and World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) observations at a daily temporal resolution and 1 degree spatial resolution, Mj\"olnir captures the nonlinear mapping between large-scale environmental conditions and lightning activity. The model architecture is based on the InceptionNeXt backbone with SENet, and a multi-task learning strategy to simultaneously predict lightning occurrence and magnitude. Extensive evaluations yield that Mollnir accurately reproduces the global distribution, seasonal variability, and regional characteristics of lightning activity, achieving a global Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96 for annual mean fields. These results suggest that Mj\"olnir serves not only as an effective data-driven global lightning parameterization but also as a promising AI-based scheme for next-generation Earth system models (AI-ESMs).</description>

      <title>Efficient Training of Physics-enhanced Neural ODEs via Direct Collocation and Nonlinear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for training Physics-enhanced Neural ODEs (PeN-ODEs) by expressing the training process as a dynamic optimization problem. The full model, including neural components, is discretized using a high-order implicit Runge-Kutta method with flipped Legendre-Gauss-Radau points, resulting in a large-scale nonlinear program (NLP) efficiently solved by state-of-the-art NLP solvers such as Ipopt. This formulation enables simultaneous optimization of network parameters and state trajectories, addressing key limitations of ODE solver-based training in terms of stability, runtime, and accuracy. Extending on a recent direct collocation-based method for Neural ODEs, we generalize to PeN-ODEs, incorporate physical constraints, and present a custom, parallelized, open-source implementation. Benchmarks on a Quarter Vehicle Model and a Van-der-Pol oscillator demonstrate superior accuracy, speed, generalization with smaller networks compared to other training techniques. We also outline a planned integration into OpenModelica to enable accessible training of Neural DAEs.</description>

      <title>GRILL: Gradient Signal Restoration in Ill-Conditioned Layers to Enhance Adversarial Attacks on Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarial robustness of deep autoencoders (AEs) remains relatively unexplored, even though their non-invertible nature poses distinct challenges. Existing attack algorithms during the optimization of imperceptible, norm-bounded adversarial perturbations to maximize output damage in AEs, often stop at sub-optimal attacks. We observe that the adversarial loss gradient vanishes when backpropagated through ill-conditioned layers. This issue arises from near-zero singular values in the Jacobians of these layers, which weaken the gradient signal during optimization. We introduce GRILL, a technique that locally restores gradient signals in ill-conditioned layers, enabling more effective norm-bounded attacks. Through extensive experiments on different architectures of popular AEs, under both sample-specific and universal attack setups, and across standard and adaptive attack settings, we show that our method significantly increases the effectiveness of our adversarial attacks, enabling a more rigorous evaluation of AE robustness.</description>

      <title>A Generative Neural Annealer for Black-Box Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generative, end-to-end solver for black-box combinatorial optimization that emphasizes both sample efficiency and solution quality on NP problems. Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard, the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively "opening" the black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Traffic Flow Modeling: a Multi-Gradient Descent and Pareto Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is crucial in modern traffic flow modeling because it combines the benefits of both physics-based and data-driven approaches. In conventional PIML, physical information is typically incorporated by constructing a hybrid loss function that combines data-driven loss and physics loss through linear scalarization. The goal is to find a trade-off between these two objectives to improve the accuracy of model predictions. However, from a mathematical perspective, linear scalarization is limited to identifying only the convex region of the Pareto front, as it treats data-driven and physics losses as separate objectives. Given that most PIML loss functions are non-convex, linear scalarization restricts the achievable trade-off solutions. Moreover, tuning the weighting coefficients for the two loss components can be both time-consuming and computationally challenging. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a paradigm shift in PIML by reformulating the training process as a multi-objective optimization problem, treating data-driven loss and physics loss independently. We apply several multi-gradient descent algorithms (MGDAs), including traditional multi-gradient descent (TMGD) and dual cone gradient descent (DCGD), to explore the Pareto front in this multi-objective setting. These methods are evaluated on both macroscopic and microscopic traffic flow models. In the macroscopic case, MGDAs achieved comparable performance to traditional linear scalarization methods. Notably, in the microscopic case, MGDAs significantly outperformed their scalarization-based counterparts, demonstrating the advantages of a multi-objective optimization approach in complex PIML scenarios.</description>

      <title>Stepsize anything: A unified learning rate schedule for budgeted-iteration training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The expanding computational costs and limited resources underscore the critical need for budgeted-iteration training, which aims to achieve optimal learning within predetermined iteration budgets. While learning rate schedules fundamentally govern the performance of different networks and tasks, particularly in budgeted-iteration scenarios, their design remains largely heuristic, lacking theoretical foundations. In addition, the optimal learning rate schedule requires extensive trial-and-error selection, making the training process inefficient. In this work, we propose the Unified Budget-Aware (UBA) schedule, a theoretically grounded learning rate schedule that consistently outperforms commonly-used schedules among diverse architectures and tasks under different constrained training budgets. First, we bridge the gap by constructing a novel training budget-aware optimization framework, which explicitly accounts for the robustness to landscape curvature variations. From this framework, we derive the UBA schedule, controlled by a single hyper-parameter \varphi that provides a trade-off between flexibility and simplicity, eliminating the need for per-network numerical optimization. Moreover, we establish a theoretical connection between \varphi and the condition number, adding interpretation and justification to our approach. Besides, we prove the convergence for different values of \varphi. We offer practical guidelines for its selection via theoretical analysis and empirical results. Extensive experimental results show that UBA consistently surpasses the commonly-used schedules across diverse vision and language tasks, spanning network architectures (e.g., ResNet, OLMo) and scales, under different training-iteration budgets.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Multi-Task Federated Foundation Models for Next-Generation Extended Reality Systems: Towards Privacy-Preserving Distributed Intelligence in AR/VR/MR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05683v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extended reality (XR) systems, which consist of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (XR), offer a transformative interface for immersive, multi-modal, and embodied human-computer interaction. In this paper, we envision that multi-modal multi-task (M3T) federated foundation models (FedFMs) can offer transformative capabilities for XR systems through integrating the representational strength of M3T foundation models (FMs) with the privacy-preserving model training principles of federated learning (FL). We present a modular architecture for FedFMs, which entails different coordination paradigms for model training and aggregations. Central to our vision is the codification of XR challenges that affect the implementation of FedFMs under the SHIFT dimensions: (1) Sensor and modality diversity, (2) Hardware heterogeneity and system-level constraints, (3) Interactivity and embodied personalization, (4) Functional/task variability, and (5) Temporality and environmental variability. We illustrate the manifestation of these dimensions across a set of emerging and anticipated applications of XR systems. Finally, we propose evaluation metrics, dataset requirements, and design tradeoffs necessary for the development of resource-aware FedFMs in XR. This perspective aims to chart the technical and conceptual foundations for context-aware privacy-preserving intelligence in the next generation of XR systems.</description>

      <title>AtmosMJ: Revisiting Gating Mechanism for AI Weather Forecasting Beyond the Year Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of Large Weather Models (LWMs) has marked a turning point in data-driven forecasting, with many models now outperforming traditional numerical systems in the medium range. However, achieving stable, long-range autoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge. Prevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as SFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard spatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the prevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce physical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that assumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be achieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep convolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical remapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion (GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error accumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that AtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days. In quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy against models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a remarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU. Our findings suggest that efficient architectural design, rather than non-standard data representation, can be the key to unlocking stable and computationally efficient long-range weather prediction.</description>

      <title>Boost Post-Training Quantization via Null Space Optimization for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing post-training quantization methods for large language models (LLMs) offer remarkable success. However, the increasingly marginal performance gains suggest that existing quantization strategies are insufficient to support the development of more compressed models. To inspire new directions for future research, this paper introduces the concept of null space into LLMs quantization. We argue that the quantization error can be effectively alleviated by constraining the post-quantization weight perturbation to lie within the null space of input activations. To prove this idea, we propose a plug-and-play null space projection module for existing milestone PTQ baselines named Q2N. Specifically, we first design an efficient and accurate null space projection approximation method tailored to the characteristics of LLMs. Subsequently, we theoretically derive a closed-form solution for an equivalent vector of the obtained projection matrix, which satisfies practical inference condition while avoiding additional memory overhead. Extensive experiments are conducted on various state-of-the-art LLMs (LLaMA3, DeepSeek, Qwen3) and baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of both our Q2N and the perspective of null space optimization for LLMs quantization. We view this paper the first step to further alleviate the quantization error based on the insights of null space, hoping it inspiring future researchers to design more advanced quantization methods.

      <title>Thought Anchors: Which LLM Reasoning Steps Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which identified "broadcasting" sentences that receive disproportionate attention from all future sentences via "receiver" attention heads; (3) a causal attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an open-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper understanding of reasoning models.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Neural Architecture Search with Weighted Response Correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a promising approach for automatically designing neural network architectures. However, the architecture estimation of NAS is computationally expensive and time-consuming because of training multiple architectures from scratch. Although existing zero-shot NAS methods use training-free proxies to accelerate the architecture estimation, their effectiveness, stability, and generality are still lacking. We present a novel training-free estimation proxy called weighted response correlation (WRCor). WRCor utilizes correlation coefficient matrices of responses across different input samples to calculate the proxy scores of estimated architectures, which can measure their expressivity and generalizability. Experimental results on proxy evaluation demonstrate that WRCor and its voting proxies are more efficient estimation strategies than existing proxies. We also apply them with different search strategies in architecture search. Experimental results on architecture search show that our zero-shot NAS algorithm outperforms most existing NAS algorithms in different search spaces. Our NAS algorithm can discover an architecture with a 22.1% test error on the ImageNet-1k dataset within 4 GPU hours. All codes are publicly available at https://github.com/kunjing96/ZSNAS-WRCor.git.</description>

      <title>Confounder-Free Continual Learning via Recursive Feature Normalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Confounders are extraneous variables that affect both the input and the target, resulting in spurious correlations and biased predictions. There are recent advances in dealing with or removing confounders in traditional models, such as metadata normalization (MDN), where the distribution of the learned features is adjusted based on the study confounders. However, in the context of continual learning, where a model learns continuously from new data over time without forgetting, learning feature representations that are invariant to confounders remains a significant challenge. To remove their influence from intermediate feature representations, we introduce the Recursive MDN (R-MDN) layer, which can be integrated into any deep learning architecture, including vision transformers, and at any model stage. R-MDN performs statistical regression via the recursive least squares algorithm to maintain and continually update an internal model state with respect to changing distributions of data and confounding variables. Our experiments demonstrate that R-MDN promotes equitable predictions across population groups, both within static learning and across different stages of continual learning, by reducing catastrophic forgetting caused by confounder effects changing over time.</description>

      <title>Algorithm Development in Neural Networks: Insights from the Streaming Parity Task</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Even when massively overparameterized, deep neural networks show a remarkable ability to generalize. Research on this phenomenon has focused on generalization within distribution, via smooth interpolation. Yet in some settings neural networks also learn to extrapolate to data far beyond the bounds of the original training set, sometimes even allowing for infinite generalization, implying that an algorithm capable of solving the task has been learned. Here we undertake a case study of the learning dynamics of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on the streaming parity task in order to develop an effective theory of algorithm development. The streaming parity task is a simple but nonlinear task defined on sequences up to arbitrary length. We show that, with sufficient finite training experience, RNNs exhibit a phase transition to perfect infinite generalization. Using an effective theory for the representational dynamics, we find an implicit representational merger effect which can be interpreted as the construction of a finite automaton that reproduces the task. Overall, our results disclose one mechanism by which neural networks can generalize infinitely from finite training experience.</description>

Abstract: Diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection share a common mathematical structure, despite their apparent differences. Here I show that a simple notational partitioning of change by the Price equation reveals a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law: $\Delta\mathbf{\theta} = \mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{\xi}$. The force $\mathbf{f}$ drives improvement in parameters, $\Delta\mathbf{\theta}$, in proportion to the slope of performance with respect to the parameters. The metric $\mathbf{M}$ rescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or changes in the frame of reference. The noise $\mathbf{\xi}$ enables exploration. This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating, Newton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics, Adam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same underlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in learning dynamics. By exposing this common structure, the FMB law provides a principled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning algorithms across disciplines.</description>

      <title>EcoTransformer: Attention without Multiplication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Transformer, with its scaled dot-product attention mechanism, has become a foundational architecture in modern AI. However, this mechanism is computationally intensive and incurs substantial energy costs. We propose a new Transformer architecture EcoTransformer, in which the output context vector is constructed as the convolution of the values using a Laplacian kernel, where the distances are measured by the L1 metric between the queries and keys. Compared to dot-product based attention, the new attention score calculation is free of matrix multiplication. It performs on par with, or even surpasses, scaled dot-product attention in NLP, bioinformatics, and vision tasks, while consuming significantly less energy.

      <title>From Entanglement to Alignment: Representation Space Decomposition for Unsupervised Time Series Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain shift poses a fundamental challenge in time series analysis, where models trained on source domain often fail dramatically when applied in target domain with different yet similar distributions. While current unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods attempt to align cross-domain feature distributions, they typically treat features as indivisible entities, ignoring their intrinsic compositions that govern domain adaptation. We introduce DARSD, a novel UDA framework with theoretical explainability that explicitly realizes UDA tasks from the perspective of representation space decomposition. Our core insight is that effective domain adaptation requires not just alignment, but principled disentanglement of transferable knowledge from mixed representations. DARSD consists of three synergistic components: (I) An adversarial learnable common invariant basis that projects original features into a domain-invariant subspace while preserving semantic content; (II) A prototypical pseudo-labeling mechanism that dynamically separates target features based on confidence, hindering error accumulation; (III) A hybrid contrastive optimization strategy that simultaneously enforces feature clustering and consistency while mitigating emerging distribution gaps. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four benchmarks (WISDM, HAR, HHAR, and MFD) demonstrate DARSD's superiority against 12 UDA algorithms, achieving optimal performance in 35 out of 53 scenarios and ranking first across all benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in time series forecasting, accurate modeling of time series with strong heterogeneity in magnitude and/or sparsity patterns remains challenging for state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. We identify several factors that lead existing models to systematically underperform on low-magnitude and sparse time series, including loss functions with implicit biases toward high-magnitude series, training-time sampling methods, and limitations of time series encoding methods.
  SPADE-S is a robust forecasting architecture that significantly reduces magnitude- and sparsity-based systematic biases and improves overall prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that SPADE-S outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across a diverse set of use cases in demand forecasting. In particular, we show that, depending on the quantile forecast and magnitude of the series, SPADE-S can improve forecast accuracy by up to 15%. This results in P90 overall forecast accuracy gains of 2.21%, 6.58%, and 4.28%, and P50 forecast accuracy gains of 0.92%, 0.77%, and 1.95%, respectively, for each of three distinct datasets, ranging from 3 million to 700 million series, from a large online retailer.</description>

      <title>KFS: KAN based adaptive Frequency Selection learning architecture for long term time series forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-scale decomposition architectures have emerged as predominant methodologies in time series forecasting. However, real-world time series exhibit noise interference across different scales, while heterogeneous information distribution among frequency components at varying scales leads to suboptimal multi-scale representation. Inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Parseval's theorem, we propose a KAN based adaptive Frequency Selection learning architecture (KFS) to address these challenges. This framework tackles prediction challenges stemming from cross-scale noise interference and complex pattern modeling through its FreK module, which performs energy-distribution-based dominant frequency selection in the spectral domain. Simultaneously, KAN enables sophisticated pattern representation while timestamp embedding alignment synchronizes temporal representations across scales. The feature mixing module then fuses scale-specific patterns with aligned temporal features. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world time series datasets demonstrate that KT achieves state-of-the-art performance as a simple yet effective architecture.</description>

      <title>Proactive Constrained Policy Optimization with Preemptive Penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) often faces significant issues such as constraint violations and instability, necessitating the use of constrained policy optimization, which seeks optimal policies while ensuring adherence to specific constraints like safety. Typically, constrained optimization problems are addressed by the Lagrangian method, a post-violation remedial approach that may result in oscillations and overshoots. Motivated by this, we propose a novel method named Proactive Constrained Policy Optimization (PCPO) that incorporates a preemptive penalty mechanism. This mechanism integrates barrier items into the objective function as the policy nears the boundary, imposing a cost. Meanwhile, we introduce a constraint-aware intrinsic reward to guide boundary-aware exploration, which is activated only when the policy approaches the constraint boundary. We establish theoretical upper and lower bounds for the duality gap and the performance of the PCPO update, shedding light on the method's convergence characteristics. Additionally, to enhance the optimization performance, we adopt a policy iteration approach. An interesting finding is that PCPO demonstrates significant stability in experiments. Experimental results indicate that the PCPO framework provides a robust solution for policy optimization under constraints, with important implications for future research and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Encodings for Active Feature Acquisition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active Feature Acquisition is an instance-wise, sequential decision making problem. The aim is to dynamically select which feature to measure based on current observations, independently for each test instance. Common approaches either use Reinforcement Learning, which experiences training difficulties, or greedily maximize the conditional mutual information of the label and unobserved features, which makes myopic acquisitions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a latent variable model, trained in a supervised manner. Acquisitions are made by reasoning about the features across many possible unobserved realizations in a stochastic latent space. Extensive evaluation on a large range of synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that our approach reliably outperforms a diverse set of baselines.</description>

      <title>Beyond Manually Designed Pruning Policies with Second-Level Performance Prediction: A Pruning Framework for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-uniform structured network pruning methods can effectively reduce Large Language Model (LLM) size by eliminating redundant channels or layers, offering lower performance degradation than uniform strategies. However, existing non-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g., layer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt to scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical bottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further limits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning policies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning Framework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design dependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports real-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable to static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and real-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can evaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative optimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can generate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to 33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods, outperforming manually designed pruning policies. The performance predictor achieves second-level performance prediction with high accuracy (prediction error &lt; 0.0011). It reduces the mean evaluation latency from minute-level (1 minute and 38.02 seconds of test-set evaluation methods) to second-level (1.52 seconds), achieving over 64 times speedup. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Ma-zx/PPF .</description>

      <title>Entity Representation Learning Through Onsite-Offsite Graph for Pinterest Ads</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been extensively applied to industry recommendation systems, as seen in models like GraphSage\cite{GraphSage}, TwHIM\cite{TwHIM}, LiGNN\cite{LiGNN} etc. In these works, graphs were constructed based on users' activities on the platforms, and various graph models were developed to effectively learn node embeddings. In addition to users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged by other large-scale industrial models.</description>

      <title>DMSC: Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework for Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch, inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for TSF tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/1327679995/DMSC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Context-Adaptive Multi-Prompt Embedding, a novel approach to enrich semantic representations in vision-language contrastive learning. Unlike standard CLIP-style models that rely on a single text embedding, our method introduces multiple structured prompts, each containing a distinct adaptive token that captures diverse semantic aspects of the input text. We leverage a pretrained LLM as the text encoder within the CLIP framework, processing all prompts jointly in a single forward pass. The resulting prompt embeddings are combined into a unified text representation, enabling semantically richer alignment with visual features. To further promote semantic diversity and representation quality, we incorporate a diversity regularization loss and a negation-aware loss, encouraging specialization across prompts and improving contrastive discrimination. Our method achieves consistent improvements on both image-text and video-text retrieval benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their strong zero-shot capabilities and widespread real-world applications. Such models typically require a computationally costly pretraining on large-scale, carefully curated collections of real-world sequences. To allow for a sample-efficient pretraining of TSFMs, we propose CauKer, a novel algorithm designed to generate diverse, causally coherent synthetic time series with realistic trends, seasonality, and nonlinear interactions. CauKer combines Gaussian Process (GP) kernel composition with Structural Causal Models (SCM) to produce data for sample-efficient pretraining of state-of-the-art classification TSFMs having different architectures and following different pretraining approaches. Additionally, our experiments reveal that CauKer-generated datasets exhibit clear scaling laws for both dataset size (10K to 10M samples) and model capacity (1M to 783M parameters), unlike real-world datasets, which display irregular scaling behavior.</description>

      <title>HALO: Hindsight-Augmented Learning for Online Auto-Bidding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital advertising platforms operate millisecond-level auctions through Real-Time Bidding (RTB) systems, where advertisers compete for ad impressions through algorithmic bids. This dynamic mechanism enables precise audience targeting but introduces profound operational complexity due to advertiser heterogeneity: budgets and ROI targets span orders of magnitude across advertisers, from individual merchants to multinational brands. This diversity creates a demanding adaptation landscape for Multi-Constraint Bidding (MCB). Traditional auto-bidding solutions fail in this environment due to two critical flaws: 1) severe sample inefficiency, where failed explorations under specific constraints yield no transferable knowledge for new budget-ROI combinations, and 2) limited generalization under constraint shifts, as they ignore physical relationships between constraints and bidding coefficients. To address this, we propose HALO: Hindsight-Augmented Learning for Online Auto-Bidding. HALO introduces a theoretically grounded hindsight mechanism that repurposes all explorations into training data for arbitrary constraint configuration via trajectory reorientation. Further, it employs B-spline functional representation, enabling continuous, derivative-aware bid mapping across constraint spaces. HALO ensures robust adaptation even when budget/ROI requirements differ drastically from training scenarios. Industrial dataset evaluations demonstrate the superiority of HALO in handling multi-scale constraints, reducing constraint violations while improving GMV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) remains highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks, especially under real-world hyper-heterogeneity, where clients differ significantly in data distributions, communication capabilities, and model architectures. Such heterogeneity not only undermines the effectiveness of aggregation strategies but also makes attacks more difficult to detect. Furthermore, high-dimensional models expand the attack surface. To address these challenges, we propose Horus, a heterogeneity-oblivious robust FL framework centered on low-rank adaptations (LoRAs). Rather than aggregating full model parameters, Horus inserts LoRAs into empirically stable layers and aggregates only LoRAs to reduce the attack uncover a key empirical observation that the input projection (LoRA-A) is markedly more stable than the output projection (LoRA-B) under heterogeneity and poisoning. Leveraging this, we design a Heterogeneity-Oblivious Poisoning Score using the features from LoRA-A to filter poisoned clients. For the remaining benign clients, we propose projection-aware aggregation mechanism to preserve collaborative signals while suppressing drifts, which reweights client updates by consistency with the global directions. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, model architectures, and attacks demonstrate that Horus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both robustness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Streaming Generated Gaussian Process Experts for Online Learning and Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs), as a nonparametric learning method, offer flexible modeling capabilities and calibrated uncertainty quantification for function approximations. Additionally, GPs support online learning by efficiently incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time settings. In this paper, we propose a streaming kernel-induced progressively generated expert framework of Gaussian processes (SkyGP) that addresses both computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts, while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Self-Questioning Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can large language models improve without external data -- by generating their own questions and answers? We hypothesize that a pre-trained language model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM): an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests which are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework on three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the OMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually generating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language models can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated training datasets.</description>

      <title>Symmetry &amp; Critical Points for Symmetric Tensor Decomposition Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07886v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonconvex optimization problem associated with the decomposition of a real symmetric tensor into a sum of rank-one terms. Use is made of the rich symmetry structure to construct infinite families of critical points represented by Puiseux series in the problem dimension, and so obtain precise analytic estimates on the objective function value and the Hessian spectrum. The results enable an analytic characterization of various obstructions to local optimization methods, revealing, in particular, a complex array of saddles and minima that differ in their symmetry, structure, and analytic properties. A notable phenomenon, observed for all critical points considered, concerns the index of the Hessian increasing with the objective function value.</description>

      <title>Thompson Exploration with Best Challenger Rule in Best Arm Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the fixed-confidence best arm identification (BAI) problem in the bandit framework in the canonical single-parameter exponential models. For this problem, many policies have been proposed, but most of them require solving an optimization problem at every round and/or are forced to explore an arm at least a certain number of times except those restricted to the Gaussian model. To address these limitations, we propose a novel policy that combines Thompson sampling with a computationally efficient approach known as the best challenger rule. While Thompson sampling was originally considered for maximizing the cumulative reward, we demonstrate that it can be used to naturally explore arms in BAI without forcing it. We show that our policy is asymptotically optimal for any two-armed bandit problems and achieves near optimality for general $K$-armed bandit problems for $K\geq 3$. Nevertheless, in numerical experiments, our policy shows competitive performance compared to asymptotically optimal policies in terms of sample complexity while requiring less computation cost. In addition, we highlight the advantages of our policy by comparing it to the concept of $\beta$-optimality, a relaxed notion of asymptotic optimality commonly considered in the analysis of a class of policies including the proposed one.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Coded Federated Learning: Privacy Preservation and Straggler Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we address the problem of federated learning in the presence of stragglers. For this problem, a coded federated learning framework has been proposed, where the central server aggregates gradients received from the non-stragglers and gradient computed from a privacy-preservation global coded dataset to mitigate the negative impact of the stragglers. However, when aggregating these gradients, fixed weights are consistently applied across iterations, neglecting the generation process of the global coded dataset and the dynamic nature of the trained model over iterations. This oversight may result in diminished learning performance. To overcome this drawback, we propose a new method named adaptive coded federated learning (ACFL). In ACFL, before the training, each device uploads a coded local dataset with additive noise to the central server to generate a global coded dataset under privacy preservation requirements. During each iteration of the training, the central server aggregates the gradients received from the non-stragglers and the gradient computed from the global coded dataset, where an adaptive policy for varying the aggregation weights is designed. Under this policy, we optimize the performance in terms of privacy and learning, where the learning performance is analyzed through convergence analysis and the privacy performance is characterized via mutual information differential privacy. Finally, we perform simulations to demonstrate the superiority of ACFL compared with the non-adaptive methods.</description>

      <title>Improving Sequential Market Coordination via Value-oriented Renewable Energy Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) brings huge uncertainty into the electricity markets. The current deterministic clearing approach in the day-ahead (DA) market, where RESs participate based on expected production, has been criticized for causing a lack of coordination between the DA and real-time (RT) markets, leading to high overall operating costs. Previous works indicate that improving day-ahead RES entering quantities can significantly mitigate the drawbacks of deterministic clearing. In this work, we propose using a trained forecasting model, referred to as value-oriented forecasting, to determine RES Improved Entering Quantities (RIEQ) more efficiently during the operational phase. Unlike traditional models that minimize statistical forecasting errors, our approach trains model parameters to minimize the expected overall operating costs across both DA and RT markets. We derive the exact form of the loss function used for training, which becomes piecewise linear when market clearing is modeled by linear programs. Additionally, we provide the analytical gradient of the loss function with respect to the forecast, enabling an efficient training strategy. Numerical studies demonstrate that our forecasts significantly reduce overall operating costs for deterministic market clearing compared to conventional forecasts based on expected RES production.</description>

      <title>Generating Accurate Synthetic Survival Data by Conditioning on Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetically generated data can improve privacy, fairness, and data accessibility; however, it can be challenging in specialized scenarios such as survival analysis. One key challenge in this setting is censoring, i.e., the timing of an event is unknown in some cases. Existing methods struggle to accurately reproduce the distributions of both observed and censored event times when generating synthetic data. We propose a conceptually simple approach that generates covariates conditioned on event times and censoring indicators by leveraging existing tabular data generation models without making assumptions about the mechanism underlying censoring. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and improves downstream survival model performance.</description>

      <title>CityLight: A Neighborhood-inclusive Universal Model for Coordinated City-scale Traffic Signal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02126v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: City-scale traffic signal control (TSC) involves thousands of heterogeneous intersections with varying topologies, making cooperative decision-making across intersections particularly challenging. Given the prohibitive computational cost of learning individual policies for each intersection, some researchers explore learning a universal policy to control each intersection in a decentralized manner, where the key challenge is to construct a universal representation method for heterogeneous intersections. However, existing methods are limited to universally representing information of heterogeneous ego intersections, neglecting the essential representation of influence from their heterogeneous neighbors. Universally incorporating neighborhood information is nontrivial due to the intrinsic complexity of traffic flow interactions, as well as the challenge of modeling collective influences from neighbor intersections. To address these challenges, we propose CityLight, which learns a universal policy based on representations obtained with two major modules: a Neighbor Influence Encoder to explicitly model neighbor's influence with specified traffic flow relation and connectivity to the ego intersection; a Neighbor Influence Aggregator to attentively aggregate the influence of neighbors based on their mutual competitive relations. Extensive experiments on five city-scale datasets, ranging from 97 to 13,952 intersections, confirm the efficacy of CityLight, with an average throughput improvement of 11.68% and a lift of 22.59% for generalization.</description>

      <title>Fairness Definitions in Language Models Explained</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Despite these advancements, LMs can inherit and amplify societal biases related to sensitive attributes such as gender and race, limiting their adoption in real-world applications. Therefore, fairness has been extensively explored in LMs, leading to the proposal of various fairness notions. However, the lack of clear agreement on which fairness definition to apply in specific contexts and the complexity of understanding the distinctions between these definitions can create confusion and impede further progress. To this end, this paper proposes a systematic survey that clarifies the definitions of fairness as they apply to LMs. Specifically, we begin with a brief introduction to LMs and fairness in LMs, followed by a comprehensive, up-to-date overview of existing fairness notions in LMs and the introduction of a novel taxonomy that categorizes these concepts based on their transformer architecture: encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder LMs. We further illustrate each definition through experiments, showcasing their practical implications and outcomes. Finally, we discuss current research challenges and open questions, aiming to foster innovative ideas and advance the field.

Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) allows a deep neural network (DNN) trained on one type of data to be adapted for new problems with limited information. We propose to use the TL technique in physics. The DNN learns the details of one process, and after fine-tuning, it makes predictions for related processes. We consider the DNNs, trained on inclusive electron-carbon scattering data, and show that after fine-tuning, they accurately predict cross sections for electron interactions with nuclear targets ranging from helium-3 to iron.</description>

      <title>SINDyG: Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-Structured Data, with Applications to Stuart-Landau Oscillator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04463v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combination of machine learning (ML) and sparsity-promoting techniques is enabling direct extraction of governing equations from data, revolutionizing computational modeling in diverse fields of science and engineering. The discovered dynamical models could be used to address challenges in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, epidemiology, and beyond. However, most existing sparse identification methods for discovering dynamical systems treat the whole system as one without considering the interactions between subsystems. As a result, such models are not able to capture small changes in the emergent system behavior. To address this issue, we developed a new method called Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-structured data (SINDyG), which incorporates the network structure into sparse regression to identify model parameters that explain the underlying network dynamics. We tested our proposed method using several case studies of neuronal dynamics, where we modeled the macroscopic oscillation of a population of neurons using the extended Stuart-Landau (SL) equation and utilize the SINDyG method to identify the underlying nonlinear dynamics. Our extensive computational experiments validate the improved accuracy and simplicity of discovered network dynamics when compared to the original SINDy approach. The proposed graph-informed penalty can be easily integrated with other symbolic regression algorithms, enhancing model interpretability and performance by incorporating network structure into the regression process.</description>

      <title>Prompt Obfuscation for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11026v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: System prompts that include detailed instructions to describe the task performed by the underlying LLM can easily transform foundation models into tools and services with minimal overhead. They are often considered intellectual property, similar to the code of a software product, because of their crucial impact on the utility. However, extracting system prompts is easily possible. As of today, there is no effective countermeasure to prevent the stealing of system prompts, and all safeguarding efforts could be evaded. In this work, we propose an alternative to conventional system prompts. We introduce prompt obfuscation to prevent the extraction of the system prompt with little overhead. The core idea is to find a representation of the original system prompt that leads to the same functionality, while the obfuscated system prompt does not contain any information that allows conclusions to be drawn about the original system prompt. We evaluate our approach by comparing our obfuscated prompt output with the output of the original prompt, using eight distinct metrics to measure the lexical, character-level, and semantic similarity. We show that the obfuscated version is constantly on par with the original one. We further perform three different deobfuscation attacks with varying attacker knowledge--covering both black-box and white-box conditions--and show that in realistic attack scenarios an attacker is unable to extract meaningful information. Overall, we demonstrate that prompt obfuscation is an effective mechanism to safeguard the intellectual property of a system prompt while maintaining the same utility as the original prompt.</description>

      <title>pyhgf: A neural network library for predictive coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian models of cognition have gained considerable traction in computational neuroscience and psychiatry. Their scopes are now expected to expand rapidly to artificial intelligence, providing general inference frameworks to support embodied, adaptable, and energy-efficient autonomous agents. A central theory in this domain is predictive coding, which posits that learning and behaviour are driven by hierarchical probabilistic inferences about the causes of sensory inputs. Biological realism constrains these networks to rely on simple local computations in the form of precision-weighted predictions and prediction errors. This can make this framework highly efficient, but its implementation comes with unique challenges on the software development side. Embedding such models in standard neural network libraries often becomes limiting, as these libraries' compilation and differentiation backends can force a conceptual separation between optimization algorithms and the systems being optimized. This critically departs from other biological principles such as self-monitoring, self-organisation, cellular growth and functional plasticity. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{pyhgf}: a Python package backed by JAX and Rust for creating, manipulating and sampling dynamic networks for predictive coding. We improve over other frameworks by enclosing the network components as transparent, modular and malleable variables in the message-passing steps. The resulting graphs can implement arbitrary computational complexities as beliefs propagation. But the transparency of core variables can also translate into inference processes that leverage self-organisation principles, and express structure learning, meta-learning or causal discovery as the consequence of network structural adaptation to surprising inputs.

Abstract: We developed a rapid scanning optical microscope, termed "BlurryScope", that leverages continuous image acquisition and deep learning to provide a cost-effective and compact solution for automated inspection and analysis of tissue sections. This device offers comparable speed to commercial digital pathology scanners, but at a significantly lower price point and smaller size/weight. Using BlurryScope, we implemented automated classification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) scores on motion-blurred images of immunohistochemically (IHC) stained breast tissue sections, achieving concordant results with those obtained from a high-end digital scanning microscope. Using a test set of 284 unique patient cores, we achieved testing accuracies of 79.3% and 89.7% for 4-class (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) and 2-class (0/1+, 2+/3+) HER2 classification, respectively. BlurryScope automates the entire workflow, from image scanning to stitching and cropping, as well as HER2 score classification.</description>

      <title>DiffGAN: A Test Generation Approach for Differential Testing of Deep Neural Networks for Image Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed across applications. However, ensuring their reliability remains a challenge, and in many situations, alternative models with similar functionality and accuracy are available. Traditional accuracy-based evaluations often fail to capture behavioral differences between models, especially with limited test datasets, making it difficult to select or combine models effectively. Differential testing addresses this by generating test inputs that expose discrepancies in DNN model behavior. However, existing approaches face significant limitations: many rely on model internals or are constrained by available seed inputs. To address these challenges, we propose DiffGAN, a black-box test image generation approach for differential testing of DNN models. DiffGAN leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II to generate diverse and valid triggering inputs that reveal behavioral discrepancies between models. DiffGAN employs two custom fitness functions, focusing on diversity and divergence, to guide the exploration of the GAN input space and identify discrepancies between models' outputs. By strategically searching this space, DiffGAN generates inputs with specific features that trigger differences in model behavior. DiffGAN is black-box, making it applicable in more situations. We evaluate DiffGAN on eight DNN model pairs trained on widely used image datasets. Our results show DiffGAN significantly outperforms a SOTA baseline, generating four times more triggering inputs, with greater diversity and validity, within the same budget. Additionally, the generated inputs improve the accuracy of a machine learning-based model selection mechanism, which selects the best-performing model based on input characteristics and can serve as a smart output voting mechanism when using alternative models.</description>

      <title>LAMA: Stable Dual-Domain Deep Reconstruction For Sparse-View CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems arise in many applications, especially tomographic imaging. We develop a Learned Alternating Minimization Algorithm (LAMA) to solve such problems via two-block optimization by synergizing data-driven and classical techniques with proven convergence. LAMA is naturally induced by a variational model with learnable regularizers in both data and image domains, parameterized as composite functions of neural networks trained with domain-specific data. We allow these regularizers to be nonconvex and nonsmooth to extract features from data effectively. We minimize the overall objective function using Nesterov's smoothing technique and residual learning architecture. It is demonstrated that LAMA reduces network complexity, improves memory efficiency, and enhances reconstruction accuracy, stability, and interpretability. Extensive experiments show that LAMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmark datasets for Computed Tomography.</description>

      <title>Causality-Driven Audits of Model Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robustness audits of deep neural networks (DNN) provide a means to uncover model sensitivities to the challenging real-world imaging conditions that significantly degrade DNN performance in-the-wild. Such conditions are often the result of multiple interacting factors inherent to the environment, sensor, or processing pipeline and may lead to complex image distortions that are not easily categorized. When robustness audits are limited to a set of isolated imaging effects or distortions, the results cannot be (easily) transferred to real-world conditions where image corruptions may be more complex or nuanced. To address this challenge, we present a new alternative robustness auditing method that uses causal inference to measure DNN sensitivities to the factors of the imaging process that cause complex distortions. Our approach uses causal models to explicitly encode assumptions about the domain-relevant factors and their interactions. Then, through extensive experiments on natural and rendered images across multiple vision tasks, we show that our approach reliably estimates causal effects of each factor on DNN performance using only observational domain data. These causal effects directly tie DNN sensitivities to observable properties of the imaging pipeline in the domain of interest towards reducing the risk of unexpected DNN failures when deployed in that domain.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Estimation of CNN Deep Feature Density using Copula and the Generalized Characteristic Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel empirical approach toward estimating the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the deep features of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Estimating the PDF of deep CNN features is an important task, because it will yield new insight into deep representations. Moreover, characterizing the statistical behavior has implications for the feasibility of promising downstream tasks such as density based anomaly detection. Expressive, yet interpretable estimation of the deep feature PDF is challenging due to the Curse of Dimensionality (CoD) as well as our limited ability to comprehend high-dimensional inter-dependencies. Our novel estimation technique combines copula analysis with the Method of Orthogonal Moments (MOM), in order to directly estimate the Generalized Characteristic Function (GCF) of the multivariate deep feature PDF. We find that the one-dimensional marginals of non-negative deep CNN features after major blocks are not well approximated by a Gaussian distribution, and that the features of deep layers are much better approximated by the Exponential, Gamma, and/or Weibull distributions. Furthermore, we observe that deep features become increasingly long-tailed with network depth, although surprisingly the rate of this increase is much slower than theoretical estimates. Finally, we observe that many deep features exhibit strong dependence (either correlation or anti-correlation) with other extremely strong detections, even if these features are independent within typical ranges. We elaborate on these findings in our discussion, where we hypothesize that the long-tail of large valued features corresponds to the strongest computer vision detections of semantic targets, which would imply that these large-valued features are not outliers but rather an important detection signal.</description>

      <title>Real-World Offline Reinforcement Learning from Vision Language Model Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning can enable policy learning from pre-collected, sub-optimal datasets without online interactions. This makes it ideal for real-world robots and safety-critical scenarios, where collecting online data or expert demonstrations is slow, costly, and risky. However, most existing offline RL works assume the dataset is already labeled with the task rewards, a process that often requires significant human effort, especially when ground-truth states are hard to ascertain (e.g., in the real-world). In this paper, we build on prior work, specifically RL-VLM-F, and propose a novel system that automatically generates reward labels for offline datasets using preference feedback from a vision-language model and a text description of the task. Our method then learns a policy using offline RL with the reward-labeled dataset. We demonstrate the system's applicability to a complex real-world robot-assisted dressing task, where we first learn a reward function using a vision-language model on a sub-optimal offline dataset, and then we use the learned reward to employ Implicit Q learning to develop an effective dressing policy. Our method also performs well in simulation tasks involving the manipulation of rigid and deformable objects, and significantly outperform baselines such as behavior cloning and inverse RL. In summary, we propose a new system that enables automatic reward labeling and policy learning from unlabeled, sub-optimal offline datasets.</description>

      <title>CLaSP: Learning Concepts for Time-Series Signals from Natural Language Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents CLaSP, a novel model for retrieving time-series signals using natural language queries that describe signal characteristics. The ability to search time-series signals based on descriptive queries is essential in domains such as industrial diagnostics, where data scientists often need to find signals with specific characteristics. However, existing methods rely on sketch-based inputs, predefined synonym dictionaries, or domain-specific manual designs, limiting their scalability and adaptability. CLaSP addresses these challenges by employing contrastive learning to map time-series signals to natural language descriptions. Unlike prior approaches, it eliminates the need for predefined synonym dictionaries and leverages the rich contextual knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Using the TRUCE and SUSHI datasets, which pair time-series signals with natural language descriptions, we demonstrate that CLaSP achieves high accuracy in retrieving a variety of time series patterns based on natural language queries.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Consistent Nonparametric Linkage-Based Clustering of Data Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13922v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonparametric clustering of $M$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data sequences generated from {\em unknown} distributions. The distributions of the $M$ data sequences belong to $K$ underlying distribution clusters. Existing results on exponentially consistent nonparametric clustering algorithms, like single linkage-based (SLINK) clustering and $k$-medoids distribution clustering, assume that the maximum intra-cluster distance ($d_L$) is smaller than the minimum inter-cluster distance ($d_H$). First, in the fixed sample size (FSS) setting, we show that exponential consistency can be achieved for SLINK clustering under a less strict assumption, $d_I &lt; d_H$, where $d_I$ is the maximum distance between any two sub-clusters of a cluster that partition the cluster. Note that $d_I &lt; d_L$ in general. Thus, our results show that SLINK is exponentially consistent for a larger class of problems than previously known. In our simulations, we also identify examples where $k$-medoids clustering is unable to find the true clusters, but SLINK is exponentially consistent. Then, we propose a sequential clustering algorithm, named SLINK-SEQ, based on SLINK and prove that it is also exponentially consistent. Simulation results show that the SLINK-SEQ algorithm requires fewer expected number of samples than the FSS SLINK algorithm for the same probability of error.</description>

      <title>Why the Agent Made that Decision: Contrastive Explanation Learning for Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in solving complex decision-making problems, yet its adoption in critical domains is hindered by the lack of interpretability in its decision-making processes. Existing explainable AI (xAI) approaches often fail to provide meaningful explanations for RL agents, particularly because they overlook the contrastive nature of human reasoning--answering "why this action instead of that one?". To address this gap, we propose a novel framework of contrastive learning to explain RL selected actions, named $\textbf{VisionMask}$. VisionMask is trained to generate explanations by explicitly contrasting the agent's chosen action with alternative actions in a given state using a self-supervised manner. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through experiments across diverse RL environments, evaluating it in terms of faithfulness, robustness, and complexity. Our results show that VisionMask significantly improves human understanding of agent behavior while maintaining accuracy and fidelity. Furthermore, we present examples illustrating how VisionMask can be used for counterfactual analysis. This work bridges the gap between RL and xAI, paving the way for safer and more interpretable RL systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Discrete Encoders: Identifiable Deep Generative Models for Rich Data with Discrete Latent Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of generative AI, deep generative models (DGMs) with latent representations have gained tremendous popularity. Despite their impressive empirical performance, the statistical properties of these models remain underexplored. DGMs are often overparametrized, non-identifiable, and uninterpretable black boxes, raising serious concerns when deploying them in high-stakes applications. Motivated by this, we propose interpretable deep generative models for rich data types with discrete latent layers, called Deep Discrete Encoders (DDEs). A DDE is a directed graphical model with multiple binary latent layers. Theoretically, we propose transparent identifiability conditions for DDEs, which imply progressively smaller sizes of the latent layers as they go deeper. Identifiability ensures consistent parameter estimation and inspires an interpretable design of the deep architecture. Computationally, we propose a scalable estimation pipeline of a layerwise nonlinear spectral initialization followed by a penalized stochastic approximation EM algorithm. This procedure can efficiently estimate models with exponentially many latent components. Extensive simulation studies for high-dimensional data and deep architectures validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the excellent performance of our algorithms. We apply DDEs to three diverse real datasets with different data types to perform hierarchical topic modeling, image representation learning, and response time modeling in educational testing.</description>

      <title>Slow is Fast! Dissecting Ethereum's Slow Liquidity Drain Scams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify the slow liquidity drain (SLID) scam, an insidious and highly profitable threat to decentralized finance (DeFi), posing a large-scale, persistent, and growing risk to the ecosystem. Unlike traditional scams such as rug pulls or honeypots (USENIX Sec'19, USENIX Sec'23), SLID gradually siphons funds from liquidity pools over extended periods, making detection significantly more challenging. In this paper, we conducted the first large-scale empirical analysis of 319,166 liquidity pools across six major decentralized exchanges (DEXs) since 2018. We identified 3,117 SLID affected liquidity pools, resulting in cumulative losses of more than US$103 million. We propose a rule-based heuristic and an enhanced machine learning model for early detection. Our machine learning model achieves a detection speed 4.77 times faster than the heuristic while maintaining 95% accuracy. Our study establishes a foundation for protecting DeFi investors at an early stage and promoting transparency in the DeFi ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Learning to Inference Adaptively for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in visual reasoning, yet come with substantial computational cost, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained settings. Despite recent effort on improving the efficiency of MLLMs, prior solutions fall short in responding to varying runtime conditions, in particular changing resource availability (e.g., contention due to the execution of other programs on the device). To bridge this gap, we introduce AdaLLaVA, an adaptive inference framework that learns to dynamically reconfigure operations in an MLLM during inference, accounting for the input data and a latency budget. We conduct extensive experiments across benchmarks involving question-answering, reasoning, and hallucination. Our results show that AdaLLaVA effectively adheres to input latency budget, achieving varying accuracy and latency tradeoffs at runtime. Further, we demonstrate that AdaLLaVA adapts to both input latency and content, can be integrated with token selection for enhanced efficiency, and generalizes across MLLMs. Our project webpage with code release is at https://zhuoyan-xu.github.io/ada-llava/.</description>

      <title>Understanding Flatness in Generative Models: Its Role and Benefits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat minima, known to enhance generalization and robustness in supervised learning, remain largely unexplored in generative models. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of loss surface flatness in generative models, both theoretically and empirically, with a particular focus on diffusion models. We establish a theoretical claim that flatter minima improve robustness against perturbations in target prior distributions, leading to benefits such as reduced exposure bias -- where errors in noise estimation accumulate over iterations -- and significantly improved resilience to model quantization, preserving generative performance even under strong quantization constraints. We further observe that Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), which explicitly controls the degree of flatness, effectively enhances flatness in diffusion models even surpassing the indirectly promoting flatness methods -- Input Perturbation (IP) which enforces the Lipschitz condition, ensembling-based approach like Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) -- are less effective. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, LSUN Tower, and FFHQ, we demonstrate that flat minima in diffusion models indeed improve not only generative performance but also robustness.</description>

      <title>Efficient Data Selection for Training Genomic Perturbation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14571v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genomic studies, including CRISPR-based Perturb-seq analyses, face a vast hypothesis space, while gene perturbations remain costly and time-consuming. Gene perturbation models based on graph neural networks are trained to predict the outcomes of gene perturbations to facilitate such experiments. Due to the cost of genomic experiments, active learning is often employed to train these models, alternating between wet-lab experiments and model updates. However, the operational constraints of the wet-lab and the iterative nature of active learning significantly increase the total training time. Furthermore, the inherent sensitivity to model initialization can lead to markedly different sets of gene perturbations across runs, which undermines the reproducibility, interpretability, and reusability of the method. To this end, we propose a graph-based data filtering method that, unlike active learning, selects the gene perturbations in one shot and in a model-free manner. The method optimizes a criterion that maximizes the supervision signal from the graph neural network to enhance generalization. The criterion is defined over the input graph and is optimized with submodular maximization. We compare it empirically to active learning, and the results demonstrate that despite yielding months of acceleration, it also improves the stability of the selected perturbation experiments while achieving comparable test error.</description>

Abstract: Since the advent of the ``Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE)'' paper, learning ODEs with deep learning has been applied to system identification, time-series forecasting, and related areas. Exploiting the diffeomorphic nature of ODE solution maps, neural ODEs has also enabled their use in generative modeling. Despite the rich potential to incorporate various kinds of physical information, training Neural ODEs remains challenging in practice. This study demonstrates, through the simplest one-dimensional linear model, why training Neural ODEs is difficult. We then propose a new stabilization method and provide an analytical convergence analysis. The insights and techniques presented here serve as a concise tutorial for researchers beginning work on Neural ODEs.</description>

      <title>PROM: Prioritize Reduction of Multiplications Over Lower Bit-Widths for Efficient CNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are crucial for computer vision tasks on resource-constrained devices. Quantization effectively compresses these models, reducing storage size and energy cost. However, in modern depthwise-separable architectures, the computational cost is distributed unevenly across its components, with pointwise operations being the most expensive. By applying a general quantization scheme to this imbalanced cost distribution, existing quantization approaches fail to fully exploit potential efficiency gains. To this end, we introduce PROM, a straightforward approach for quantizing modern depthwise-separable convolutional networks by selectively using two distinct bit-widths. Specifically, pointwise convolutions are quantized to ternary weights, while the remaining modules use 8-bit weights, which is achieved through a simple quantization-aware training procedure. Additionally, by quantizing activations to 8-bit, our method transforms pointwise convolutions with ternary weights into int8 additions, which enjoy broad support across hardware platforms and effectively eliminates the need for expensive multiplications. Applying PROM to MobileNetV2 reduces the model's energy cost by more than an order of magnitude (23.9x) and its storage size by 2.7x compared to the float16 baseline while retaining similar classification performance on ImageNet. Our method advances the Pareto frontier for energy consumption vs. top-1 accuracy for quantized convolutional models on ImageNet. PROM addresses the challenges of quantizing depthwise-separable convolutional networks to both ternary and 8-bit weights, offering a simple way to reduce energy cost and storage size.</description>

      <title>Traceable Black-box Watermarks for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the distributed nature of Federated Learning (FL) systems, each local client has access to the global model, posing a critical risk of model leakage. Existing works have explored injecting watermarks into local models to enable intellectual property protection. However, these methods either focus on non-traceable watermarks or traceable but white-box watermarks. We identify a gap in the literature regarding the formal definition of traceable black-box watermarking and the formulation of the problem of injecting such watermarks into FL systems. In this work, we first formalize the problem of injecting traceable black-box watermarks into FL. Based on the problem, we propose a novel server-side watermarking method, $\mathbf{TraMark}$, which creates a traceable watermarked model for each client, enabling verification of model leakage in black-box settings. To achieve this, $\mathbf{TraMark}$ partitions the model parameter space into two distinct regions: the main task region and the watermarking region. Subsequently, a personalized global model is constructed for each client by aggregating only the main task region while preserving the watermarking region. Each model then learns a unique watermark exclusively within the watermarking region using a distinct watermark dataset before being sent back to the local client. Extensive results across various FL systems demonstrate that $\mathbf{TraMark}$ ensures the traceability of all watermarked models while preserving their main task performance.</description>

      <title>Explain Less, Understand More: Jargon Detection via Personalized Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalizing jargon detection and explanation is essential for making technical documents accessible to readers with diverse disciplinary backgrounds. However, tailoring models to individual users typically requires substantial annotation efforts and computational resources due to user-specific finetuning. To address this, we present a systematic study of personalized jargon detection, focusing on methods that are both efficient and scalable for real-world deployment. We explore two personalization strategies: (1) lightweight fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on open-source models, and (2) personalized prompting, which tailors model behavior at inference time without retaining. To reflect realistic constraints, we also investigate hybrid approaches that combine limited annotated data with unsupervised user background signals. Our personalized LoRA model outperforms GPT-4 by 21.4% in F1 score and exceeds the best performing oracle baseline by 8.3%. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only 10% of the annotated training data, demonstrating its practicality for resource-constrained settings. Our study offers the first work to systematically explore efficient, low-resource personalization of jargon detection using open-source language models, offering a practical path toward scalable, user-adaptive NLP system.</description>

      <title>Model Internal Sleuthing: Finding Lexical Identity and Inflectional Morphology in Modern Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large transformer-based language models dominate modern NLP, yet our understanding of how they encode linguistic information is rooted in studies of early models like BERT and GPT-2. To better understand today's language models, we investigate how 25 models - from classical architectures (BERT, DeBERTa, GPT-2) to modern large language models (Pythia, OLMo-2, Gemma-2, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.1) - represent lexical identity and inflectional morphology across six typologically diverse languages. Using linear and nonlinear classifiers trained on hidden activations, we predict word lemmas and inflectional features layer by layer. We find that models concentrate lexical information linearly in early layers and increasingly nonlinearly in later layers, while keeping inflectional information uniformly accessible and linearly separable throughout. Additional experiments probe the nature of these encodings: attention and residual analyses examine where within layers information can be recovered, steering vector experiments test what information can be functionally manipulated, and intrinsic dimensionality analyses explore how the representational structure evolves across layers. Remarkably, these encoding patterns emerge across all models we test, despite differences in architecture, size, and training regime (pretrained and instruction-tuned variants). This suggests that, even with substantial advances in LLM technologies, transformer models organize linguistic information in similar ways, indicating that these properties are important for next token prediction and are learned early during pretraining.

      <title>On the Fundamental Impossibility of Hallucination Control in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06382v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a fundamental impossibility theorem: no LLM capable performing non-trivial knowledge aggregation can simultaneously achieve truthful (internally consistent) knowledge representation, semantic information conservation, complete revelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality. This impossibility is not an engineering limitation but arises from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself. We establish this result by describing the inference process as an auction of ideas, where distributed components compete exploiting their partial knowledge to shape responses. The proof spans three independent mathematical domains: mechanism design theory (Green-Laffont), the theory of proper scoring rules (Savage), and direct architectural analysis of transformers (Log-Sum-Exp convexity). In particular, we show how in the strictly concave settings the score of an aggregate of diverse beliefs strictly exceeds the sum of individual scores. That gap may quantify the creation of unattributable certainty or overconfidence -- the mathematical origin of both hallucination and creativity, or imagination.
  To support this analysis, we introduce the complementary concepts of the semantic information measure and the emergence operator to model bounded reasoning in a general setting. We prove that while bounded reasoning generates accessible information, providing valuable insights and inspirations, idealized reasoning strictly preserves semantic content. By demonstrating that hallucination and imagination are mathematically identical phenomena-grounded in the necessary violation of information conservation-this paper offers a principled foundation for managing these behaviors in advanced AI systems. Finally, we present some speculative ideas to inspire evaluation and refinements of the proposed theory.</description>

      <title>SLR: Automated Synthesis for Scalable Logical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15787v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given a user's task specification, SLR automatically synthesizes (i) an instruction prompt for an inductive reasoning task, (ii) a validation program, executable on model outputs to provide verifiable rewards, and (iii) the latent ground-truth rule. This process is fully automated, scalable, requires no human annotations, and offers precise control over task difficulty. Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising 19k prompts organized into 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs demonstrate improved performance but incur very high test-time computation, with costs exceeding $300 for just 1,000 prompts. Finally, curriculum learning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. Moreover, these reasoning capabilities generalize to a wide range of established benchmarks, underscoring the effectiveness of SLR for downstream reasoning.</description>

      <title>IS-Bench: Evaluating Interactive Safety of VLM-Driven Embodied Agents in Daily Household Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems. Code and data are released under [this https URL](https://github.com/AI45Lab/IS-Bench).</description>

      <title>UnMix-NeRF: Spectral Unmixing Meets Neural Radiance Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties. This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material segmentation to existing methods.

      <title>A Comparative Study of Specialized LLMs as Dense Retrievers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as dense retrievers, the impact of their domain-specific specialization on retrieval effectiveness remains underexplored. This investigation systematically examines how task-specific adaptations in LLMs influence their retrieval capabilities, an essential step toward developing unified retrievers capable of handling text, code, images, and multimodal content. We conduct extensive experiments with eight Qwen2.5 7B LLMs, including base, instruction-tuned, code/math-specialized, long reasoning, and vision-language models across zero-shot retrieval settings and the supervised setting. For the zero-shot retrieval settings, we consider text retrieval from the BEIR benchmark and code retrieval from the CoIR benchmark. Further, to evaluate supervised performance, all LLMs are fine-tuned on the MS MARCO dataset. We find that mathematical specialization and the long reasoning capability cause consistent degradation in three settings, indicating conflicts between mathematical reasoning and semantic matching. The vision-language model and code-specialized LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot performance compared to other LLMs, even surpassing BM25 on the code retrieval task, and maintain comparable performance to base LLMs in supervised settings. These findings suggest promising directions for the unified retrieval task leveraging cross-domain and cross-modal fusion.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces Higher Gauge Flow Models, a novel class of Generative Flow Models. Building upon ordinary Gauge Flow Models (arXiv:2507.13414), these Higher Gauge Flow Models leverage an L$_{\infty}$-algebra, effectively extending the Lie Algebra. This expansion allows for the integration of the higher geometry and higher symmetries associated with higher groups into the framework of Generative Flow Models. Experimental evaluation on a Gaussian Mixture Model dataset revealed substantial performance improvements compared to traditional Flow Models.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking a Tunable Quantum Neural Network on Trapped-Ion and Superconducting Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement a quantum generalization of a neural network on trapped-ion and IBM superconducting quantum computers to classify MNIST images, a common benchmark in computer vision. The network feedforward involves qubit rotations whose angles depend on the results of measurements in the previous layer. The network is trained via simulation, but inference is performed experimentally on quantum hardware. The classical-to-quantum correspondence is controlled by an interpolation parameter, $a$, which is zero in the classical limit. Increasing $a$ introduces quantum uncertainty into the measurements, which is shown to improve network performance at moderate values of the interpolation parameter. We then focus on particular images that fail to be classified by a classical neural network but are detected correctly in the quantum network. For such borderline cases, we observe strong deviations from the simulated behavior. We attribute this to physical noise, which causes the output to fluctuate between nearby minima of the classification energy landscape. Such strong sensitivity to physical noise is absent for clear images. We further benchmark physical noise by inserting additional single-qubit and two-qubit gate pairs into the neural network circuits. Our work provides a springboard toward more complex quantum neural networks on current devices: while the approach is rooted in standard classical machine learning, scaling up such networks may prove classically non-simulable and could offer a route to near-term quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Graph-based Recommendations with Majority-Voting LLM-Rerank Augmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommendation systems often suffer from data sparsity caused by limited user-item interactions, which degrade their performance and amplify popularity bias in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel data augmentation framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and item textual descriptions to enrich interaction data. By few-shot prompting LLMs multiple times to rerank items and aggregating the results via majority voting, we generate high-confidence synthetic user-item interactions, supported by theoretical guarantees based on the concentration of measure. To effectively leverage the augmented data in the context of a graph recommendation system, we integrate it into a graph contrastive learning framework to mitigate distributional shift and alleviate popularity bias. Extensive experiments show that our method improves accuracy and reduces popularity bias, outperforming strong baselines.</description>

      <title>XSpecMesh: Quality-Preserving Auto-Regressive Mesh Generation Acceleration via Multi-Head Speculative Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current auto-regressive models can generate high-quality, topologically precise meshes; however, they necessitate thousands-or even tens of thousands-of next-token predictions during inference, resulting in substantial latency. We introduce XSpecMesh, a quality-preserving acceleration method for auto-regressive mesh generation models. XSpecMesh employs a lightweight, multi-head speculative decoding scheme to predict multiple tokens in parallel within a single forward pass, thereby accelerating inference. We further propose a verification and resampling strategy: the backbone model verifies each predicted token and resamples any tokens that do not meet the quality criteria. In addition, we propose a distillation strategy that trains the lightweight decoding heads by distilling from the backbone model, encouraging their prediction distributions to align and improving the success rate of speculative predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 1.7x speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Our code will be released.</description>

      <title>RL-PLUS: Countering Capability Boundary Collapse of LLMs in Reinforcement Learning with Hybrid-policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00222v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of the base LLM, due to its essentially on-policy strategy coupled with LLM's immense action space and sparse reward. Critically, RLVR can lead to the capability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel hybrid-policy optimization approach for LLMs that synergizes internal exploitation with external data to achieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models. RL-PLUS integrates two core components, i.e., Multiple Importance Sampling to address distributional mismatch from external data, and Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. Compared with existing RLVR methods, RL-PLUS achieves 1) state-of-the-art performance on six math reasoning benchmarks; 2) superior performance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks; 3) consistent and significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative improvements up to 69.2\%. Moreover, the analysis of Pass@k curves indicates that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability boundary collapse problem.</description>

Abstract: Deploying Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices for long-sequence tasks remains challenging due to the quadratic time complexity of self-attention and growing Key-Value (KV) cache demands. While existing KV cache optimizations improve memory efficiency, they often fail to reduce time to first token (TTFT) and may degrade performance through token pruning. Alternative sequence modeling architectures address some of these limitations, but typically require full retraining and lack infrastructure support. EdgeInfinite offers an efficient solution by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, maintaining quality while reducing both computational and memory costs, including improved TTFT. However, its instruction-following ability is limited, and it lacks mobile-specific optimizations. To address these issues, we propose EdgeInfinite-Instruct, which introduces a Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning (S-SFT) strategy tailored to long-sequence tasks such as summarization and question answering. We further optimized EdgeInfinite-Instruct for efficient deployment on edge NPUs by employing fine-grained post-training quantization (PTQ) to reduce computational demands while maintaining accuracy, and by implementing a fixed-shape computation graph that balances memory usage and on-device efficiency through scenario-specific customization of input token and cache sizes. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and real-world mobile tasks show that our approach improves domain-specific performance while maintaining efficiency on NPU-accelerated edge devices.</description>

      <title>Learning Pivoting Manipulation with Force and Vision Feedback Using Optimization-based Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation is challenging due to complex contact interactions between objects, the environment, and robots. Model-based approaches can efficiently generate complex trajectories of robots and objects under contact constraints. However, they tend to be sensitive to model inaccuracies and require access to privileged information (e.g., object mass, size, pose), making them less suitable for novel objects. In contrast, learning-based approaches are typically more robust to modeling errors but require large amounts of data. In this paper, we bridge these two approaches to propose a framework for learning closed-loop pivoting manipulation. By leveraging computationally efficient Contact-Implicit Trajectory Optimization (CITO), we design demonstration-guided deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), leading to sample-efficient learning. We also present a sim-to-real transfer approach using a privileged training strategy, enabling the robot to perform pivoting manipulation using only proprioception, vision, and force sensing without access to privileged information. Our method is evaluated on several pivoting tasks, demonstrating that it can successfully perform sim-to-real transfer. The overview of our method and the hardware experiments are shown at https://youtu.be/akjGDgfwLbM?si=QVw6ExoPy2VsU2g6</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multi-view Open-set Learning via Ambiguity Uncertainty Calibration and View-wise Debiasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing multi-view learning models struggle in open-set scenarios due to their implicit assumption of class completeness. Moreover, static view-induced biases, which arise from spurious view-label associations formed during training, further degrade their ability to recognize unknown categories. In this paper, we propose a multi-view open-set learning framework via ambiguity uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing. To simulate ambiguous samples, we design O-Mix, a novel synthesis strategy to generate virtual samples with calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty. These samples are further processed by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network that captures atypical patterns for improved open-set adaptation. Furthermore, we incorporate an HSIC-based contrastive debiasing module that enforces independence between view-specific ambiguous and view-consistent representations, encouraging the model to learn generalizable features. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances unknown-class recognition while preserving strong closed-set performance.</description>

      <title>Supervised Dynamic Dimension Reduction with Deep Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of dimension reduction, tailored to improving time series forecasting with high-dimensional predictors. We propose a novel Supervised Deep Dynamic Principal component analysis (SDDP) framework that incorporates the target variable and lagged observations into the factor extraction process. Assisted by a temporal neural network, we construct target-aware predictors by scaling the original predictors in a supervised manner, with larger weights assigned to predictors with stronger forecasting power. A principal component analysis is then performed on the target-aware predictors to extract the estimated SDDP factors. This supervised factor extraction not only improves predictive accuracy in the downstream forecasting task but also yields more interpretable and target-specific latent factors. Building upon SDDP, we propose a factor-augmented nonlinear dynamic forecasting model that unifies a broad family of factor-model-based forecasting approaches. To further demonstrate the broader applicability of SDDP, we extend our studies to a more challenging scenario when the predictors are only partially observable. We validate the empirical performance of the proposed method on several real-world public datasets. The results show that our algorithm achieves notable improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>
