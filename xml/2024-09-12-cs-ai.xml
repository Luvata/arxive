      <title>Deep Generative Model for Mechanical System Configuration Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI has made remarkable progress in addressing various design challenges. One prominent area where generative AI could bring significant value is in engineering design. In particular, selecting an optimal set of components and their interfaces to create a mechanical system that meets design requirements is one of the most challenging and time-consuming tasks for engineers. This configuration design task is inherently challenging due to its categorical nature, multiple design requirements a solution must satisfy, and the reliance on physics simulations for evaluating potential solutions. These characteristics entail solving a combinatorial optimization problem with multiple constraints involving black-box functions. To address this challenge, we propose a deep generative model to predict the optimal combination of components and interfaces for a given design problem. To demonstrate our approach, we solve a gear train synthesis problem by first creating a synthetic dataset using a grammar, a parts catalogue, and a physics simulator. We then train a Transformer using this dataset, named GearFormer, which can not only generate quality solutions on its own, but also augment search methods such as an evolutionary algorithm and Monte Carlo tree search. We show that GearFormer outperforms such search methods on their own in terms of satisfying the specified design requirements with orders of magnitude faster generation time. Additionally, we showcase the benefit of hybrid methods that leverage both GearFormer and search methods, which further improve the quality of the solutions.</description>

      <title>MLLM-FL: Multimodal Large Language Model Assisted Federated Learning on Heterogeneous and Long-tailed Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies on federated learning (FL) often encounter performance degradation due to data heterogeneity among different clients. In light of the recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4v and LLaVA, which demonstrate their exceptional proficiency in multimodal tasks, such as image captioning and multimodal question answering. We introduce a novel federated learning framework, named Multimodal Large Language Model Assisted Federated Learning (MLLM-FL), which which employs powerful MLLMs at the server end to address the heterogeneous and long-tailed challenges. Owing to the advanced cross-modality representation capabilities and the extensive open-vocabulary prior knowledge of MLLMs, our framework is adept at harnessing the extensive, yet previously underexploited, open-source data accessible from websites and powerful server-side computational resources. Hence, the MLLM-FL not only enhances the performance but also avoids increasing the risk of privacy leakage and the computational burden on local devices, distinguishing it from prior methodologies. Our framework has three key stages. Initially, prior to local training on local datasets of clients, we conduct global visual-text pretraining of the model. This pretraining is facilitated by utilizing the extensive open-source data available online, with the assistance of multimodal large language models. Subsequently, the pretrained model is distributed among various clients for local training. Finally, once the locally trained models are transmitted back to the server, a global alignment is carried out under the supervision of MLLMs to further enhance the performance. Experimental evaluations on established benchmarks, show that our framework delivers promising performance in the typical scenarios with data heterogeneity and long-tail distribution across different clients in FL.</description>

      <title>MAGDA: Multi-agent guideline-driven diagnostic assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In emergency departments, rural hospitals, or clinics in less developed regions, clinicians often lack fast image analysis by trained radiologists, which can have a detrimental effect on patients' healthcare. Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to alleviate some pressure from these clinicians by providing insights that can help them in their decision-making. While these LLMs achieve high test results on medical exams showcasing their great theoretical medical knowledge, they tend not to follow medical guidelines. In this work, we introduce a new approach for zero-shot guideline-driven decision support. We model a system of multiple LLM agents augmented with a contrastive vision-language model that collaborate to reach a patient diagnosis. After providing the agents with simple diagnostic guidelines, they will synthesize prompts and screen the image for findings following these guidelines. Finally, they provide understandable chain-of-thought reasoning for their diagnosis, which is then self-refined to consider inter-dependencies between diseases. As our method is zero-shot, it is adaptable to settings with rare diseases, where training data is limited, but expert-crafted disease descriptions are available. We evaluate our method on two chest X-ray datasets, CheXpert and ChestX-ray 14 Longtail, showcasing performance improvement over existing zero-shot methods and generalizability to rare diseases.</description>

      <title>Superior Computer Chess with Model Predictive Control, Reinforcement Learning, and Rollout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we apply model predictive control (MPC), rollout, and reinforcement learning (RL) methodologies to computer chess. We introduce a new architecture for move selection, within which available chess engines are used as components. One engine is used to provide position evaluations in an approximation in value space MPC/RL scheme, while a second engine is used as nominal opponent, to emulate or approximate the moves of the true opponent player.
  We show that our architecture improves substantially the performance of the position evaluation engine. In other words our architecture provides an additional layer of intelligence, on top of the intelligence of the engines on which it is based. This is true for any engine, regardless of its strength: top engines such as Stockfish and Komodo Dragon (of varying strengths), as well as weaker engines.
  Structurally, our basic architecture selects moves by a one-move lookahead search, with an intermediate move generated by a nominal opponent engine, and followed by a position evaluation by another chess engine. Simpler schemes that forego the use of the nominal opponent, also perform better than the position evaluator, but not quite by as much. More complex schemes, involving multistep lookahead, may also be used and generally tend to perform better as the length of the lookahead increases.
  Theoretically, our methodology relies on generic cost improvement properties and the superlinear convergence framework of Newton's method, which fundamentally underlies approximation in value space, and related MPC/RL and rollout/policy iteration schemes. A critical requirement of this framework is that the first lookahead step should be executed exactly. This fact has guided our architectural choices, and is apparently an important factor in improving the performance of even the best available chess engines.</description>

      <title>Generative User-Experience Research for Developing Domain-specific Natural Language Processing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16143v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User experience (UX) is a part of human-computer interaction (HCI) research and focuses on increasing intuitiveness, transparency, simplicity, and trust for the system users. Most UX research for machine learning (ML) or natural language processing (NLP) focuses on a data-driven methodology. It engages domain users mainly for usability evaluation. Moreover, more typical UX methods tailor the systems towards user usability, unlike learning about the user needs first. This paper proposes a new methodology for integrating generative UX research into developing domain NLP applications. Generative UX research employs domain users at the initial stages of prototype development, i.e., ideation and concept evaluation, and the last stage for evaluating system usefulness and user utility. The methodology emerged from and is evaluated on a case study about the full-cycle prototype development of a domain-specific semantic search for daily operations in the process industry. A key finding of our case study is that involving domain experts increases their interest and trust in the final NLP application. The combined UX+NLP research of the proposed method efficiently considers data- and user-driven opportunities and constraints, which can be crucial for developing NLP applications.</description>

      <title>FairEvalLLM. A Comprehensive Framework for Benchmarking Fairness in Large Language Model Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for evaluating fairness in recommender systems powered by Large Language Models (RecLLMs), addressing the need for a unified approach that spans various fairness dimensions including sensitivity to user attributes, intrinsic fairness, and discussions of fairness based on underlying benefits. In addition, our framework introduces counterfactual evaluations and integrates diverse user group considerations to enhance the discourse on fairness evaluation for RecLLMs.
  Our key contributions include the development of a robust framework for fairness evaluation in LLM-based recommendations and a structured method to create \textit{informative user profiles} from demographic data, historical user preferences, and recent interactions. We argue that the latter is essential for enhancing personalization in such systems, especially in temporal-driven scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of our framework through practical applications on two datasets, LastFM-1K and ML-1M. We conduct experiments on a subsample of 80 users from each dataset, testing and assessing the effectiveness of various prompt construction scenarios and in-context learning, comprising more than 50 scenarios. This results in more than 4000 recommendations (80 * 50 = 4000). Our study reveals that while there are no significant unfairness issues in scenarios involving sensitive attributes, some concerns remain. However, in terms of intrinsic fairness, which does not involve direct sensitivity, unfairness across demographic groups remains significant.

      <title>COLUMBUS: Evaluating COgnitive Lateral Understanding through Multiple-choice reBUSes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While visual question-answering (VQA) benchmarks have catalyzed the development of reasoning techniques, they have focused on vertical thinking. Effective problem-solving also necessitates lateral thinking, which remains understudied in AI and has not been used to test visual perception systems. To bridge this gap, we formulate visual lateral thinking as a multiple-choice question-answering task and describe a three-step taxonomy-driven methodology for instantiating task examples. Then, we develop COLUMBUS, a synthetic benchmark that applies the task pipeline to create QA sets with text and icon rebus puzzles based on publicly available collections of compounds and common phrases. COLUMBUS comprises over 1,000 puzzles, each with four answer candidates. While the SotA vision-language models (VLMs) achieve decent performance, our evaluation demonstrates a substantial gap between humans and models. VLMs benefit from human-curated descriptions but struggle to self-generate such representations at the right level of abstraction.</description>

      <title>MA-CDMR: An Intelligent Cross-domain Multicast Routing Method based on Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning in Multi-domain SDWN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cross-domain multicast routing problem in a software-defined wireless network with multiple controllers is a classic NP-hard optimization problem. As the network size increases, designing and implementing cross-domain multicast routing paths in the network requires not only designing efficient solution algorithms to obtain the optimal cross-domain multicast tree but also ensuring the timely and flexible acquisition and maintenance of global network state information. However, existing solutions have a limited ability to sense the network traffic state, affecting the quality of service of multicast services. In addition, these methods have difficulty adapting to the highly dynamically changing network states and have slow convergence speeds. To this end, this paper aims to design and implement a multiagent deep reinforcement learning based cross-domain multicast routing method for SDWN with multicontroller domains. First, a multicontroller communication mechanism and a multicast group management module are designed to transfer and synchronize network information between different control domains of the SDWN, thus effectively managing the joining and classification of members in the cross-domain multicast group. Second, a theoretical analysis and proof show that the optimal cross-domain multicast tree includes an interdomain multicast tree and an intradomain multicast tree. An agent is established for each controller, and a cooperation mechanism between multiple agents is designed to effectively optimize cross-domain multicast routing and ensure consistency and validity in the representation of network state information for cross-domain multicast routing decisions. Third, a multiagent reinforcement learning-based method that combines online and offline training is designed to reduce the dependence on the real-time environment and increase the convergence speed of multiple agents.</description>

      <title>Simplex-enabled Safe Continual Learning Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes the SeC-Learning Machine: Simplex-enabled safe continual learning for safety-critical autonomous systems. The SeC-learning machine is built on Simplex logic (that is, ``using simplicity to control complexity'') and physics-regulated deep reinforcement learning (Phy-DRL). The SeC-learning machine thus constitutes HP (high performance)-Student, HA (high assurance)-Teacher, and Coordinator. Specifically, the HP-Student is a pre-trained high-performance but not fully verified Phy-DRL, continuing to learn in a real plant to tune the action policy to be safe. In contrast, the HA-Teacher is a mission-reduced, physics-model-based, and verified design. As a complementary, HA-Teacher has two missions: backing up safety and correcting unsafe learning. The Coordinator triggers the interaction and the switch between HP-Student and HA-Teacher. Powered by the three interactive components, the SeC-learning machine can i) assure lifetime safety (i.e., safety guarantee in any continual-learning stage, regardless of HP-Student's success or convergence), ii) address the Sim2Real gap, and iii) learn to tolerate unknown unknowns in real plants. The experiments on a cart-pole system and a real quadruped robot demonstrate the distinguished features of the SeC-learning machine, compared with continual learning built on state-of-the-art safe DRL frameworks with approaches to addressing the Sim2Real gap.</description>

      <title>Programming Refusal with Conditional Activation Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities, but precisely controlling their response behavior remains challenging. Existing activation steering methods alter LLM behavior indiscriminately, limiting their practical applicability in settings where selective responses are essential, such as content moderation or domain-specific assistants. In this paper, we propose Conditional Activation Steering (CAST), which analyzes LLM activation patterns during inference to selectively apply or withhold activation steering based on the input context. Our method is based on the observation that different categories of prompts activate distinct patterns in the model's hidden states. Using CAST, one can systematically control LLM behavior with rules like "if input is about hate speech or adult content, then refuse" or "if input is not about legal advice, then refuse." This allows for selective modification of responses to specific content while maintaining normal responses to other content, all without requiring weight optimization. We release an open-source implementation of our framework.</description>

      <title>Property Neurons in Self-Supervised Speech Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There have been many studies on analyzing self-supervised speech Transformers, in particular, with layer-wise analysis. It is, however, desirable to have an approach that can pinpoint exactly a subset of neurons that is responsible for a particular property of speech, being amenable to model pruning and model editing. In this work, we identify a set of property neurons in the feedforward layers of Transformers to study how speech-related properties, such as phones, gender, and pitch, are stored. When removing neurons of a particular property (a simple form of model editing), the respective downstream performance significantly degrades, showing the importance of the property neurons. We apply this approach to pruning the feedforward layers in Transformers, where most of the model parameters are. We show that protecting property neurons during pruning is significantly more effective than norm-based pruning.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Potential Binders: Multimodal Pretraining DEL-Fusion for Denoising DNA-Encoded Libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of drug discovery, DNA-encoded library (DEL) screening technology has emerged as an efficient method for identifying high-affinity compounds. However, DEL screening faces a significant challenge: noise arising from nonspecific interactions within complex biological systems. Neural networks trained on DEL libraries have been employed to extract compound features, aiming to denoise the data and uncover potential binders to the desired therapeutic target. Nevertheless, the inherent structure of DEL, constrained by the limited diversity of building blocks, impacts the performance of compound encoders. Moreover, existing methods only capture compound features at a single level, further limiting the effectiveness of the denoising strategy. To mitigate these issues, we propose a Multimodal Pretraining DEL-Fusion model (MPDF) that enhances encoder capabilities through pretraining and integrates compound features across various scales. We develop pretraining tasks applying contrastive objectives between different compound representations and their text descriptions, enhancing the compound encoders' ability to acquire generic features. Furthermore, we propose a novel DEL-fusion framework that amalgamates compound information at the atomic, submolecular, and molecular levels, as captured by various compound encoders. The synergy of these innovations equips MPDF with enriched, multi-scale features, enabling comprehensive downstream denoising. Evaluated on three DEL datasets, MPDF demonstrates superior performance in data processing and analysis for validation tasks. Notably, MPDF offers novel insights into identifying high-affinity molecules, paving the way for improved DEL utility in drug discovery.</description>

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to rapidly advance, there is a growing demand to integrate AI capabilities into existing business applications. However, a significant gap exists between the rapid progress in AI and how slowly AI is being embedded into business environments. Deploying well-performing lab models into production settings, especially in on-premise environments, often entails specialized expertise and imposes a heavy burden of model management, creating significant barriers to implementing AI models in real-world applications.
  KModels leverages proven libraries and platforms (Kubeflow Pipelines, KServe) to streamline AI adoption by supporting both AI developers and consumers. It allows model developers to focus solely on model development and share models as transportable units (Templates), abstracting away complex production deployment concerns. KModels enables AI consumers to eliminate the need for a dedicated data scientist, as the templates encapsulate most data science considerations while providing business-oriented control.
  This paper presents the architecture of KModels and the key decisions that shape it. We outline KModels' main components as well as its interfaces. Furthermore, we explain how KModels is highly suited for on-premise deployment but can also be used in cloud environments.
  The efficacy of KModels is demonstrated through the successful deployment of three AI models within an existing Work Order Management system. These models operate in a client's data center and are trained on local data, without data scientist intervention. One model improved the accuracy of Failure Code specification for work orders from 46% to 83%, showcasing the substantial benefit of accessible and localized AI solutions.</description>

      <title>STLLM-DF: A Spatial-Temporal Large Language Model with Diffusion for Enhanced Multi-Mode Traffic System Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) presents challenges, particularly with missing data in multi-modal transportation and the complexity of handling diverse sequential tasks within a centralized framework. To address these issues, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Large Language Model Diffusion (STLLM-DF), an innovative model that leverages Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve multi-task transportation prediction. The DDPM's robust denoising capabilities enable it to recover underlying data patterns from noisy inputs, making it particularly effective in complex transportation systems. Meanwhile, the non-pretrained LLM dynamically adapts to spatial-temporal relationships within multi-modal networks, allowing the system to efficiently manage diverse transportation tasks in both long-term and short-term predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STLLM-DF consistently outperforms existing models, achieving an average reduction of 2.40\% in MAE, 4.50\% in RMSE, and 1.51\% in MAPE. This model significantly advances centralized ITS by enhancing predictive accuracy, robustness, and overall system performance across multiple tasks, thus paving the way for more effective spatio-temporal traffic forecasting through the integration of frozen transformer language models and diffusion techniques.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{USCD}$: Improving Code Generation of LLMs by Uncertainty-Aware Selective Contrastive Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in code generation. However, the effects of hallucinations (e.g., output noise) make it particularly challenging for LLMs to generate high-quality code in one pass. In this work, we propose a simple and effective \textbf{u}ncertainty-aware \textbf{s}elective \textbf{c}ontrastive \textbf{d}ecoding ($\mathbb{USCD}$) mechanism to improve the quality of one-pass code generation in LLMs and reduce the impact of output noise. To be specific, we first elaborately designed a negative prompt (namely lame prompt) to output noise by removing input-output examples from the standard few-shot prompt. Our preliminary study shows that the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JS divergence) between token distribution uncertainty and the output noise is relatively low (approximately $0.25$), indicating their high relevance. Then, we selectively eliminate output noise induced by lame prompts based on the uncertainty of the prediction distribution from the standard prompt. Notably, our proposed plug-and-play mechanism is an inference-only method, enjoying appealing flexibility. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks, e.g., HumanEval, MBPP, and MultiPL-E, upon several LLMs (i.e., Inocder-6b, CodeLlama-7b, WizardCoder-15b, StarCoder, and Llama2-7b), demonstrate that our proposed USCD significantly improves one-pass code generation, with an average \textit{pass@$1$} scores increase of 16.59\%. We will release code and data on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Assessing SPARQL capabilities of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offers significant synergistic potential for knowledge-driven applications. One possible integration is the interpretation and generation of formal languages, such as those used in the Semantic Web, with SPARQL being a core technology for accessing KGs. In this paper, we focus on measuring out-of-the box capabilities of LLMs to work with SPARQL and more specifically with SPARQL SELECT queries applying a quantitative approach.
  We implemented various benchmarking tasks in the LLM-KG-Bench framework for automated execution and evaluation with several LLMs. The tasks assess capabilities along the dimensions of syntax, semantic read, semantic create, and the role of knowledge graph prompt inclusion.
  With this new benchmarking tasks, we evaluated a selection of GPT, Gemini, and Claude models. Our findings indicate that working with SPARQL SELECT queries is still challenging for LLMs and heavily depends on the specific LLM as well as the complexity of the task. While fixing basic syntax errors seems to pose no problems for the best of the current LLMs evaluated, creating semantically correct SPARQL SELECT queries is difficult in several cases.</description>

      <title>Alt-MoE: Multimodal Alignment via Alternating Optimization of Multi-directional MoE with Unimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Large Multi-Modal Models (LMMs) have made significant advancements in multi-modal alignment by employing lightweight connection modules to facilitate the representation and fusion of knowledge from existing pre-trained uni-modal models. However, these methods still rely on modality-specific and direction-specific connectors, leading to compartmentalized knowledge representations and reduced computational efficiency, which limits the model's ability to form unified multi-modal representations. To address these issues, we introduce a novel training framework, Alt-MoE, which employs the Mixture of Experts (MoE) as a unified multi-directional connector across modalities, and employs a multi-step sequential alternating unidirectional alignment strategy, which converges to bidirectional alignment over iterations. The extensive empirical studies revealed the following key points: 1) Alt-MoE achieves competitive results by integrating diverse knowledge representations from uni-modal models. This approach seamlessly fuses the specialized expertise of existing high-performance uni-modal models, effectively synthesizing their domain-specific knowledge into a cohesive multi-modal representation. 2) Alt-MoE efficiently scales to new tasks and modalities without altering its model architecture or training strategy. Furthermore, Alt-MoE operates in latent space, supporting vector pre-storage and real-time retrieval via lightweight multi-directional MoE, thereby facilitating massive data processing. Our methodology has been validated on several well-performing uni-modal models (LLAMA3, Qwen2, and DINOv2), achieving competitive results on a wide range of downstream tasks and datasets.</description>

      <title>DeepFM-Crispr: Prediction of CRISPR On-Target Effects via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the advent of CRISPR-Cas9, a groundbreaking gene-editing technology that enables precise genomic modifications via a short RNA guide sequence, there has been a marked increase in the accessibility and application of this technology across various fields. The success of CRISPR-Cas9 has spurred further investment and led to the discovery of additional CRISPR systems, including CRISPR-Cas13. Distinct from Cas9, which targets DNA, Cas13 targets RNA, offering unique advantages for gene modulation. We focus on Cas13d, a variant known for its collateral activity where it non-specifically cleaves adjacent RNA molecules upon activation, a feature critical to its function. We introduce DeepFM-Crispr, a novel deep learning model developed to predict the on-target efficiency and evaluate the off-target effects of Cas13d. This model harnesses a large language model to generate comprehensive representations rich in evolutionary and structural data, thereby enhancing predictions of RNA secondary structures and overall sgRNA efficacy. A transformer-based architecture processes these inputs to produce a predictive efficacy score. Comparative experiments show that DeepFM-Crispr not only surpasses traditional models but also outperforms recent state-of-the-art deep learning methods in terms of prediction accuracy and reliability.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Comparison Between ANNs and KANs For Classifying EEG Alzheimer's Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease is an incurable cognitive condition that affects thousands of people globally. While some diagnostic methods exist for Alzheimer's Disease, many of these methods cannot detect Alzheimer's in its earlier stages. Recently, researchers have explored the use of Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology for diagnosing Alzheimer's. EEG is a noninvasive method of recording the brain's electrical signals, and EEG data has shown distinct differences between patients with and without Alzheimer's. In the past, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been used to predict Alzheimer's from EEG data, but these models sometimes produce false positive diagnoses. This study aims to compare losses between ANNs and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) across multiple types of epochs, learning rates, and nodes. The results show that across these different parameters, ANNs are more accurate in predicting Alzheimer's Disease from EEG signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information retrieval (IR) is the task of finding relevant documents in response to a user query. Although Spanish is the second most spoken native language, current IR benchmarks lack Spanish data, hindering the development of information access tools for Spanish speakers. We introduce MessIRve, a large-scale Spanish IR dataset with around 730 thousand queries from Google's autocomplete API and relevant documents sourced from Wikipedia. MessIRve's queries reflect diverse Spanish-speaking regions, unlike other datasets that are translated from English or do not consider dialectal variations. The large size of the dataset allows it to cover a wide variety of topics, unlike smaller datasets. We provide a comprehensive description of the dataset, comparisons with existing datasets, and baseline evaluations of prominent IR models. Our contributions aim to advance Spanish IR research and improve information access for Spanish speakers.</description>

      <title>SongCreator: Lyrics-based Universal Song Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music is an integral part of human culture, embodying human intelligence and creativity, of which songs compose an essential part. While various aspects of song generation have been explored by previous works, such as singing voice, vocal composition and instrumental arrangement, etc., generating songs with both vocals and accompaniment given lyrics remains a significant challenge, hindering the application of music generation models in the real world. In this light, we propose SongCreator, a song-generation system designed to tackle this challenge. The model features two novel designs: a meticulously designed dual-sequence language model (DSLM) to capture the information of vocals and accompaniment for song generation, and an additional attention mask strategy for DSLM, which allows our model to understand, generate and edit songs, making it suitable for various song-related generation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SongCreator by achieving state-of-the-art or competitive performances on all eight tasks. Notably, it surpasses previous works by a large margin in lyrics-to-song and lyrics-to-vocals. Additionally, it is able to independently control the acoustic conditions of the vocals and accompaniment in the generated song through different prompts, exhibiting its potential applicability. Our samples are available at https://songcreator.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Data Linkage Across Private and Public Datasets for Collaborative Agriculture Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital agriculture leverages technology to enhance crop yield, disease resilience, and soil health, playing a critical role in agricultural research. However, it raises privacy concerns such as adverse pricing, price discrimination, higher insurance costs, and manipulation of resources, deterring farm operators from sharing data due to potential misuse. This study introduces a privacy-preserving framework that addresses these risks while allowing secure data sharing for digital agriculture. Our framework enables comprehensive data analysis while protecting privacy. It allows stakeholders to harness research-driven policies that link public and private datasets. The proposed algorithm achieves this by: (1) identifying similar farmers based on private datasets, (2) providing aggregate information like time and location, (3) determining trends in price and product availability, and (4) correlating trends with public policy data, such as food insecurity statistics. We validate the framework with real-world Farmer's Market datasets, demonstrating its efficacy through machine learning models trained on linked privacy-preserved data. The results support policymakers and researchers in addressing food insecurity and pricing issues. This work significantly contributes to digital agriculture by providing a secure method for integrating and analyzing data, driving advancements in agricultural technology and development.</description>

      <title>MTLSO: A Multi-Task Learning Approach for Logic Synthesis Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic Design Automation (EDA) is essential for IC design and has recently benefited from AI-based techniques to improve efficiency. Logic synthesis, a key EDA stage, transforms high-level hardware descriptions into optimized netlists. Recent research has employed machine learning to predict Quality of Results (QoR) for pairs of And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs) and synthesis recipes. However, the severe scarcity of data due to a very limited number of available AIGs results in overfitting, significantly hindering performance. Additionally, the complexity and large number of nodes in AIGs make plain GNNs less effective for learning expressive graph-level representations. To tackle these challenges, we propose MTLSO - a Multi-Task Learning approach for Logic Synthesis Optimization. On one hand, it maximizes the use of limited data by training the model across different tasks. This includes introducing an auxiliary task of binary multi-label graph classification alongside the primary regression task, allowing the model to benefit from diverse supervision sources. On the other hand, we employ a hierarchical graph representation learning strategy to improve the model's capacity for learning expressive graph-level representations of large AIGs, surpassing traditional plain GNNs. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving an average performance gain of 8.22\% for delay and 5.95\% for area.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multitask Learning Using Gradient-based Estimation of Task Affinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multitask learning is a widely used paradigm for training models on diverse tasks, with applications ranging from graph neural networks to language model fine-tuning. Since tasks may interfere with each other, a key notion for modeling their relationships is task affinity. This includes pairwise task affinity, computed among pairs of tasks, and higher-order affinity, computed among subsets of tasks. Naively computing either of them requires repeatedly training on data from various task combinations, which is computationally intensive. We present a new algorithm Grad-TAG that can estimate task affinities without this repeated training.
  The key idea of Grad-TAG is to train a "base" model for all tasks and then use a linearization technique to estimate the loss of the model for a specific task combination. The linearization works by computing a gradient-based approximation of the loss, using low-dimensional projections of gradients as features in a logistic regression to predict labels for the task combination. We show that the linearized model can provably approximate the loss when the gradient-based approximation is accurate, and also empirically verify that on several large models. Then, given the estimated task affinity, we design a semi-definite program for clustering similar tasks by maximizing the average density of clusters.
  We evaluate Grad-TAG's performance across seven datasets, including multi-label classification on graphs, and instruction fine-tuning of language models. Our task affinity estimates are within 2.7% distance to the true affinities while needing only 3% of FLOPs in full training. On our largest graph with 21M edges and 500 labeling tasks, our algorithm delivers estimates within 5% distance to the true affinities, using only 112 GPU hours. Our results show that Grad-TAG achieves excellent performance and runtime tradeoffs compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Latent Diffusion Bridges for Unsupervised Musical Audio Timbre Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music timbre transfer is a challenging task that involves modifying the timbral characteristics of an audio signal while preserving its melodic structure. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on dual diffusion bridges, trained using the CocoChorales Dataset, which consists of unpaired monophonic single-instrument audio data. Each diffusion model is trained on a specific instrument with a Gaussian prior. During inference, a model is designated as the source model to map the input audio to its corresponding Gaussian prior, and another model is designated as the target model to reconstruct the target audio from this Gaussian prior, thereby facilitating timbre transfer. We compare our approach against existing unsupervised timbre transfer models such as VAEGAN and Gaussian Flow Bridges (GFB). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves both better Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD) and melody preservation, as reflected by lower pitch distances (DPD) compared to VAEGAN and GFB. Additionally, we discover that the noise level from the Gaussian prior, $\sigma$, can be adjusted to control the degree of melody preservation and amount of timbre transferred.</description>

      <title>PaRCE: Probabilistic and Reconstruction-Based Competency Estimation for Safe Navigation Under Perception Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perception-based navigation systems are useful for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) navigation in complex terrains, where traditional depth-based navigation schemes are insufficient. However, these data-driven methods are highly dependent on their training data and can fail in surprising and dramatic ways with little warning. To ensure the safety of the vehicle and the surrounding environment, it is imperative that the navigation system is able to recognize the predictive uncertainty of the perception model and respond safely and effectively in the face of uncertainty. In an effort to enable safe navigation under perception uncertainty, we develop a probabilistic and reconstruction-based competency estimation (PaRCE) method to estimate the model's level of familiarity with an input image as a whole and with specific regions in the image. We find that the overall competency score can correctly predict correctly classified, misclassified, and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We also confirm that the regional competency maps can accurately distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar regions across images. We then use this competency information to develop a planning and control scheme that enables effective navigation while maintaining a low probability of error. We find that the competency-aware scheme greatly reduces the number of collisions with unfamiliar obstacles, compared to a baseline controller with no competency awareness. Furthermore, the regional competency information is very valuable in enabling efficient navigation.</description>

      <title>On the Weaknesses of Backdoor-based Model Watermarking: An Information-theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safeguarding the intellectual property of machine learning models has emerged as a pressing concern in AI security. Model watermarking is a powerful technique for protecting ownership of machine learning models, yet its reliability has been recently challenged by recent watermark removal attacks. In this work, we investigate why existing watermark embedding techniques particularly those based on backdooring are vulnerable. Through an information-theoretic analysis, we show that the resilience of watermarking against erasure attacks hinges on the choice of trigger-set samples, where current uses of out-distribution trigger-set are inherently vulnerable to white-box adversaries. Based on this discovery, we propose a novel model watermarking scheme, In-distribution Watermark Embedding (IWE), to overcome the limitations of existing method. To further minimise the gap to clean models, we analyze the role of logits as watermark information carriers and propose a new approach to better conceal watermark information within the logits. Experiments on real-world datasets including CIFAR-100 and Caltech-101 demonstrate that our method robustly defends against various adversaries with negligible accuracy loss (&lt; 0.1%).</description>

      <title>Accelerating Large Language Model Pretraining via LFR Pedagogy: Learn, Focus, and Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) pretraining traditionally relies on autoregressive language modeling on randomly sampled data blocks from web-scale datasets. We take inspiration from human learning techniques like spaced repetition to hypothesize that random data sampling for LLMs leads to high training cost and low quality models which tend to forget data. In order to effectively commit web-scale information to long-term memory, we propose the LFR (Learn, Focus, and Review) pedagogy, a new dynamic training paradigm which focuses and repeatedly reviews complex data blocks at systematic intervals based on the model's learning pace and progress. LFR records the model perplexities for different data blocks and frequently revisits blocks with higher perplexity which are more likely to be forgotten. We pretrain the GPT-2 models (124M - 1.5B) from scratch on the OpenWebText dataset using LFR. We test on downstream tasks from the language modeling, question answering, translation, and problem solving domains to achieve consistently lower perplexity and higher accuracy than the baseline OpenAI models, while obtaining a 20x pretraining speed-up.</description>

      <title>Draw an Audio: Leveraging Multi-Instruction for Video-to-Audio Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foley is a term commonly used in filmmaking, referring to the addition of daily sound effects to silent films or videos to enhance the auditory experience. Video-to-Audio (V2A), as a particular type of automatic foley task, presents inherent challenges related to audio-visual synchronization. These challenges encompass maintaining the content consistency between the input video and the generated audio, as well as the alignment of temporal and loudness properties within the video. To address these issues, we construct a controllable video-to-audio synthesis model, termed Draw an Audio, which supports multiple input instructions through drawn masks and loudness signals. To ensure content consistency between the synthesized audio and target video, we introduce the Mask-Attention Module (MAM), which employs masked video instruction to enable the model to focus on regions of interest. Additionally, we implement the Time-Loudness Module (TLM), which uses an auxiliary loudness signal to ensure the synthesis of sound that aligns with the video in both loudness and temporal dimensions. Furthermore, we have extended a large-scale V2A dataset, named VGGSound-Caption, by annotating caption prompts. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks across two large-scale V2A datasets verify Draw an Audio achieves the state-of-the-art.

      <title>Multiclass Arrhythmia Classification using Smartwatch Photoplethysmography Signals Collected in Real-life Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most deep learning models of multiclass arrhythmia classification are tested on fingertip photoplethysmographic (PPG) data, which has higher signal-to-noise ratios compared to smartwatch-derived PPG, and the best reported sensitivity value for premature atrial/ventricular contraction (PAC/PVC) detection is only 75%. To improve upon PAC/PVC detection sensitivity while maintaining high AF detection, we use multi-modal data which incorporates 1D PPG, accelerometers, and heart rate data as the inputs to a computationally efficient 1D bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (1D-Bi-GRU) model to detect three arrhythmia classes. We used motion-artifact prone smartwatch PPG data from the NIH-funded Pulsewatch clinical trial. Our multimodal model tested on 72 subjects achieved an unprecedented 83% sensitivity for PAC/PVC detection while maintaining a high accuracy of 97.31% for AF detection. These results outperformed the best state-of-the-art model by 20.81% for PAC/PVC and 2.55% for AF detection even while our model was computationally more efficient (14 times lighter and 2.7 faster).</description>

      <title>MCDGLN: Masked Connection-based Dynamic Graph Learning Network for Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by complex physiological processes. Previous research has predominantly focused on static cerebral interactions, often neglecting the brain's dynamic nature and the challenges posed by network noise. To address these gaps, we introduce the Masked Connection-based Dynamic Graph Learning Network (MCDGLN). Our approach first segments BOLD signals using sliding temporal windows to capture dynamic brain characteristics. We then employ a specialized weighted edge aggregation (WEA) module, which uses the cross convolution with channel-wise element-wise convolutional kernel, to integrate dynamic functional connectivity and to isolating task-relevant connections. This is followed by topological feature extraction via a hierarchical graph convolutional network (HGCN), with key attributes highlighted by a self-attention module. Crucially, we refine static functional connections using a customized task-specific mask, reducing noise and pruning irrelevant links. The attention-based connection encoder (ACE) then enhances critical connections and compresses static features. The combined features are subsequently used for classification. Applied to the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE I) dataset, our framework achieves a 73.3\% classification accuracy between ASD and Typical Control (TC) groups among 1,035 subjects. The pivotal roles of WEA and ACE in refining connectivity and enhancing classification accuracy underscore their importance in capturing ASD-specific features, offering new insights into the disorder.</description>

      <title>Larger Language Models Don't Care How You Think: Why Chain-of-Thought Prompting Fails in Subjective Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) in Large Language Models (LLM) has emerged as the dominant technique for performing natural language tasks, as it does not require updating the model parameters with gradient-based methods. ICL promises to "adapt" the LLM to perform the present task at a competitive or state-of-the-art level at a fraction of the computational cost. ICL can be augmented by incorporating the reasoning process to arrive at the final label explicitly in the prompt, a technique called Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, recent work has found that ICL relies mostly on the retrieval of task priors and less so on "learning" to perform tasks, especially for complex subjective domains like emotion and morality, where priors ossify posterior predictions. In this work, we examine whether "enabling" reasoning also creates the same behavior in LLMs, wherein the format of CoT retrieves reasoning priors that remain relatively unchanged despite the evidence in the prompt. We find that, surprisingly, CoT indeed suffers from the same posterior collapse as ICL for larger language models. Code is avalaible at https://github.com/gchochla/cot-priors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: "An idea is nothing more nor less than a new combination of old elements" (Young, J.W.). The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and publicly available ChatGPT have marked a significant turning point in the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into people's everyday lives. This study explores the capability of LLMs in generating novel research ideas based on information from research papers. We conduct a thorough examination of 4 LLMs in five domains (e.g., Chemistry, Computer, Economics, Medical, and Physics). We found that the future research ideas generated by Claude-2 and GPT-4 are more aligned with the author's perspective than GPT-3.5 and Gemini. We also found that Claude-2 generates more diverse future research ideas than GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Gemini 1.0. We further performed a human evaluation of the novelty, relevancy, and feasibility of the generated future research ideas. This investigation offers insights into the evolving role of LLMs in idea generation, highlighting both its capability and limitations. Our work contributes to the ongoing efforts in evaluating and utilizing language models for generating future research ideas. We make our datasets and codes publicly available.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Transformer Modelling of Density Function for Nonparametric Survival Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Survival analysis holds a crucial role across diverse disciplines, such as economics, engineering and healthcare. It empowers researchers to analyze both time-invariant and time-varying data, encompassing phenomena like customer churn, material degradation and various medical outcomes. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of such data, recent endeavors have demonstrated successful integration of deep learning methodologies to address limitations in conventional statistical approaches. However, current methods typically involve cluttered probability distribution function (PDF), have lower sensitivity in censoring prediction, only model static datasets, or only rely on recurrent neural networks for dynamic modelling. In this paper, we propose a novel survival regression method capable of producing high-quality unimodal PDFs without any prior distribution assumption, by optimizing novel Margin-Mean-Variance loss and leveraging the flexibility of Transformer to handle both temporal and non-temporal data, coined UniSurv. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that UniSurv places a significantly higher emphasis on censoring compared to other methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalizable Scene Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scene Change Detection (SCD) is vital for applications such as visual surveillance and mobile robotics. However, current SCD methods exhibit a bias to the temporal order of training datasets and limited performance on unseen domains; coventional SCD benchmarks are not able to evaluate generalization or temporal consistency. To tackle these limitations, we introduce a Generalizable Scene Change Detection Framework (GeSCF) in this work. The proposed GeSCF leverages localized semantics of a foundation model without any re-training or fine-tuning -- for generalization over unseen domains. Specifically, we design an adaptive thresholding of the similarity distribution derived from facets of the pre-trained foundation model to generate initial pseudo-change mask. We further utilize Segment Anything Model's (SAM) class-agnostic masks to refine pseudo-masks. Moreover, our proposed framework maintains commutative operations in all settings to ensure complete temporal consistency. Finally, we define new metrics, evaluation dataset, and evaluation protocol for Generalizable Scene Change Detection (GeSCD). Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeSCF excels across diverse and challenging environments -- establishing a new benchmark for SCD performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cervical cancer affects millions of women worldwide and has a significantly higher survival rate when diagnosed early. Pap smears and cervical biopsies are vital screening tools for detecting such cancer. However, the success of these screening processes depends on the skills of cytologists. A recent trend in diagnostic cytology is to apply machine-learning-based models to classify cancer using cell images. These automated models have been shown to perform just as well as, or even better than, expert cytologists. Some notable methods for classifying cervix cancers include ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, these methods are computationally expensive. We present CerviXpert, a multi-structural Convolutional Neural Network, to identify cervix cancer. We perform extensive experiments on a publicly available dataset, SiPaKMeD, to show the efficacy of our method. CerviXpert presents a promising solution for efficient cervical cancer screening and diagnosis by striking a balance between accuracy and practical feasibility.</description>

      <title>DiPT: Enhancing LLM reasoning through diversified perspective-taking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing work on improving language model reasoning typically explores a single solution path, which can be prone to errors. Inspired by perspective-taking in social studies, this paper introduces DiPT, a novel approach that complements current reasoning methods by explicitly incorporating diversified viewpoints. This approach allows the model to gain a deeper understanding of the problem's context and identify the most effective solution path during the inference stage. Additionally, it provides a general data-centric AI recipe for augmenting existing data to improve their quality for fine-tuning.
  Our empirical results demonstrate that DiPT can be flexibly integrated into existing methods that focus on a single reasoning approach, enhancing their reasoning performance and stability when presented with paraphrased problems. Furthermore, we illustrate improved context understanding by maintaining the model's safe outputs against "jailbreaking" prompts intentionally designed to bypass safeguards built into deployed models. Lastly, we show that fine-tuning with data enriched with diverse perspectives can boost the reasoning capabilities of the model compared to fine-tuning with raw data alone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is a key part of task-oriented dialogue systems, identifying important information in conversations. However, its accuracy drops significantly in spoken dialogue environments due to named entity errors from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. We introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation method that targets those entities to improve the robustness of DST model. Our novel method can control the placement of errors using keyword-highlighted prompts while introducing phonetically similar errors. As a result, our method generated sufficient error patterns on keywords, leading to improved accuracy in noised and low-accuracy ASR environments.</description>

Abstract: Handling incomplete data in multi-view classification is challenging, especially when traditional imputation methods introduce biases that compromise uncertainty estimation. Existing Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) based approaches attempt to address these issues, but they often struggle with conflicting evidence due to the limitations of the Dempster-Shafer combination rule, leading to unreliable decisions. To address these challenges, we propose the Alternating Progressive Learning Network (APLN), specifically designed to enhance EDL-based methods in incomplete MVC scenarios. Our approach mitigates bias from corrupted observed data by first applying coarse imputation, followed by mapping the data to a latent space. In this latent space, we progressively learn an evidence distribution aligned with the target domain, incorporating uncertainty considerations through EDL. Additionally, we introduce a conflict-aware Dempster-Shafer combination rule (DSCR) to better handle conflicting evidence. By sampling from the learned distribution, we optimize the latent representations of missing views, reducing bias and enhancing decision-making robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APLN, combined with DSCR, significantly outperforms traditional methods, particularly in environments characterized by high uncertainty and conflicting evidence, establishing it as a promising solution for incomplete multi-view classification.</description>

      <title>Ferret: Federated Full-Parameter Tuning at Scale for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in numerous real-world applications. Unfortunately, fine-tuning these models at scale, especially in federated settings where data privacy and communication efficiency are critical, presents significant challenges. Existing methods often resort to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to mitigate communication overhead, but this typically comes at the cost of model accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose federated full-parameter tuning at scale for LLMs (Ferret), the first first-order method with shared randomness to enable scalable full-parameter tuning of LLMs across decentralized data sources while maintaining competitive model accuracy. Ferret accomplishes this through three aspects: (1) it employs widely applied first-order methods for efficient local updates; (2) it projects these updates into a low-dimensional space to considerably reduce communication overhead; and (3) it reconstructs local updates from this low-dimensional space with shared randomness to facilitate effective full-parameter global aggregation, ensuring fast convergence and competitive final performance. Our rigorous theoretical analyses and insights along with extensive experiments, show that Ferret significantly enhances the scalability of existing federated full-parameter tuning approaches by achieving high computational efficiency, reduced communication overhead, and fast convergence, all while maintaining competitive model accuracy. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/allen4747/Ferret.</description>

      <title>Catch Me if You Can: Detecting Unauthorized Data Use in Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of deep learning (DL) has led to a surging demand for training data, which incentivizes the creators of DL models to trawl through the Internet for training materials. Meanwhile, users often have limited control over whether their data (e.g., facial images) are used to train DL models without their consent, which has engendered pressing concerns.
  This work proposes MembershipTracker, a practical data provenance tool that can empower ordinary users to take agency in detecting the unauthorized use of their data in training DL models. We view tracing data provenance through the lens of membership inference (MI). MembershipTracker consists of a lightweight data marking component to mark the target data with small and targeted changes, which can be strongly memorized by the model trained on them; and a specialized MI-based verification process to audit whether the model exhibits strong memorization on the target samples.
  Overall, MembershipTracker only requires the users to mark a small fraction of data (0.005% to 0.1% in proportion to the training set), and it enables the users to reliably detect the unauthorized use of their data (average 0% FPR@100% TPR). We show that MembershipTracker is highly effective across various settings, including industry-scale training on the full-size ImageNet-1k dataset. We finally evaluate MembershipTracker under multiple classes of countermeasures.</description>

      <title>User Preferences for Large Language Model versus Template-Based Explanations of Movie Recommendations: A Pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems have become integral to our digital experiences, from online shopping to streaming platforms. Still, the rationale behind their suggestions often remains opaque to users. While some systems employ a graph-based approach, offering inherent explainability through paths associating recommended items and seed items, non-experts could not easily understand these explanations. A popular alternative is to convert graph-based explanations into textual ones using a template and an algorithm, which we denote here as ''template-based'' explanations. Yet, these can sometimes come across as impersonal or uninspiring. A novel method would be to employ large language models (LLMs) for this purpose, which we denote as ''LLM-based''. To assess the effectiveness of LLMs in generating more resonant explanations, we conducted a pilot study with 25 participants. They were presented with three explanations: (1) traditional template-based, (2) LLM-based rephrasing of the template output, and (3) purely LLM-based explanations derived from the graph-based explanations. Although subject to high variance, preliminary findings suggest that LLM-based explanations may provide a richer and more engaging user experience, further aligning with user expectations. This study sheds light on the potential limitations of current explanation methods and offers promising directions for leveraging large language models to improve user satisfaction and trust in recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Long Video Understanding via Hierarchical Event-Based Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, integrating visual foundation models into large language models (LLMs) to form video understanding systems has attracted widespread attention. Most of the existing models compress diverse semantic information within the whole video and feed it into LLMs for content comprehension. While this method excels in short video understanding, it may result in a blend of multiple event information in long videos due to coarse compression, which causes information redundancy. Consequently, the semantics of key events might be obscured within the vast information that hinders the model's understanding capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a Hierarchical Event-based Memory-enhanced LLM (HEM-LLM) for better understanding of long videos. Firstly, we design a novel adaptive sequence segmentation scheme to divide multiple events within long videos. In this way, we can perform individual memory modeling for each event to establish intra-event contextual connections, thereby reducing information redundancy. Secondly, while modeling current event, we compress and inject the information of the previous event to enhance the long-term inter-event dependencies in videos. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on various video understanding tasks and the results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performances.</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Approach for Chord-Conditioned Song Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Song Generation task aims to synthesize music composed of vocals and accompaniment from given lyrics. While the existing method, Jukebox, has explored this task, its constrained control over the generations often leads to deficiency in music performance. To mitigate the issue, we introduce an important concept from music composition, namely chords, to song generation networks. Chords form the foundation of accompaniment and provide vocal melody with associated harmony. Given the inaccuracy of automatic chord extractors, we devise a robust cross-attention mechanism augmented with dynamic weight sequence to integrate extracted chord information into song generations and reduce frame-level flaws, and propose a novel model termed Chord-Conditioned Song Generator (CSG) based on it. Experimental evidence demonstrates our proposed method outperforms other approaches in terms of musical performance and control precision of generated songs.</description>

      <title>PharmacoMatch: Efficient 3D Pharmacophore Screening through Neural Subgraph Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing size of screening libraries poses a significant challenge for the development of virtual screening methods for drug discovery, necessitating a re-evaluation of traditional approaches in the era of big data. Although 3D pharmacophore screening remains a prevalent technique, its application to very large datasets is limited by the computational cost associated with matching query pharmacophores to database ligands. In this study, we introduce PharmacoMatch, a novel contrastive learning approach based on neural subgraph matching. Our method reinterprets pharmacophore screening as an approximate subgraph matching problem and enables efficient querying of conformational databases by encoding query-target relationships in the embedding space. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of the learned representations and benchmark our method on virtual screening datasets in a zero-shot setting. Our findings demonstrate significantly shorter runtimes for pharmacophore matching, offering a promising speed-up for screening very large datasets.</description>

      <title>LAMP: Learnable Meta-Path Guided Adversarial Contrastive Learning for Heterogeneous Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have significantly propelled the information retrieval (IR) field. Still, the effectiveness of HGNNs heavily relies on high-quality labels, which are often expensive to acquire. This challenge has shifted attention towards Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning (HGCL), which usually requires pre-defined meta-paths. However, our findings reveal that meta-path combinations significantly affect performance in unsupervised settings, an aspect often overlooked in current literature. Existing HGCL methods have considerable variability in outcomes across different meta-path combinations, thereby challenging the optimization process to achieve consistent and high performance. In response, we introduce \textsf{LAMP} (\underline{\textbf{L}}earn\underline{\textbf{A}}ble \underline{\textbf{M}}eta-\underline{\textbf{P}}ath), a novel adversarial contrastive learning approach that integrates various meta-path sub-graphs into a unified and stable structure, leveraging the overlap among these sub-graphs. To address the denseness of this integrated sub-graph, we propose an adversarial training strategy for edge pruning, maintaining sparsity to enhance model performance and robustness. \textsf{LAMP} aims to maximize the difference between meta-path and network schema views for guiding contrastive learning to capture the most meaningful information. Our extensive experimental study conducted on four diverse datasets from the Heterogeneous Graph Benchmark (HGB) demonstrates that \textsf{LAMP} significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art unsupervised models in terms of accuracy and robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As particle accelerators grow in complexity, traditional control methods face increasing challenges in achieving optimal performance. This paper envisions a paradigm shift: a decentralized multi-agent framework for accelerator control, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and distributed among autonomous agents. We present a proposition of a self-improving decentralized system where intelligent agents handle high-level tasks and communication and each agent is specialized control individual accelerator components.
  This approach raises some questions: What are the future applications of AI in particle accelerators? How can we implement an autonomous complex system such as a particle accelerator where agents gradually improve through experience and human feedback? What are the implications of integrating a human-in-the-loop component for labeling operational data and providing expert guidance? We show two examples, where we demonstrate viability of such architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a federated learning framework that enables over-the-air computation via digital communications, using a new joint source-channel coding scheme. Without relying on channel state information at devices, this scheme employs lattice codes to both quantize model parameters and exploit interference from the devices. We propose a novel receiver structure at the server, designed to reliably decode an integer combination of the quantized model parameters as a lattice point for the purpose of aggregation. We present a mathematical approach to derive a convergence bound for the proposed scheme and offer design remarks. In this context, we suggest an aggregation metric and a corresponding algorithm to determine effective integer coefficients for the aggregation in each communication round. Our results illustrate that, regardless of channel dynamics and data heterogeneity, our scheme consistently delivers superior learning accuracy across various parameters and markedly surpasses other over-the-air methodologies.</description>

      <title>VoiceWukong: Benchmarking Deepfake Voice Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of technologies like text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC), detecting deepfake voices has become increasingly crucial. However, both academia and industry lack a comprehensive and intuitive benchmark for evaluating detectors. Existing datasets are limited in language diversity and lack many manipulations encountered in real-world production environments.
  To fill this gap, we propose VoiceWukong, a benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of deepfake voice detectors. To build the dataset, we first collected deepfake voices generated by 19 advanced and widely recognized commercial tools and 15 open-source tools. We then created 38 data variants covering six types of manipulations, constructing the evaluation dataset for deepfake voice detection. VoiceWukong thus includes 265,200 English and 148,200 Chinese deepfake voice samples. Using VoiceWukong, we evaluated 12 state-of-the-art detectors. AASIST2 achieved the best equal error rate (EER) of 13.50%, while all others exceeded 20%. Our findings reveal that these detectors face significant challenges in real-world applications, with dramatically declining performance. In addition, we conducted a user study with more than 300 participants. The results are compared with the performance of the 12 detectors and a multimodel large language model (MLLM), i.e., Qwen2-Audio, where different detectors and humans exhibit varying identification capabilities for deepfake voices at different deception levels, while the LALM demonstrates no detection ability at all. Furthermore, we provide a leaderboard for deepfake voice detection, publicly available at {https://voicewukong.github.io}.</description>

      <title>Connecting Concept Convexity and Human-Machine Alignment in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how neural networks align with human cognitive processes is a crucial step toward developing more interpretable and reliable AI systems. Motivated by theories of human cognition, this study examines the relationship between \emph{convexity} in neural network representations and \emph{human-machine alignment} based on behavioral data. We identify a correlation between these two dimensions in pretrained and fine-tuned vision transformer models. Our findings suggest that the convex regions formed in latent spaces of neural networks to some extent align with human-defined categories and reflect the similarity relations humans use in cognitive tasks. While optimizing for alignment generally enhances convexity, increasing convexity through fine-tuning yields inconsistent effects on alignment, which suggests a complex relationship between the two. This study presents a first step toward understanding the relationship between the convexity of latent representations and human-machine alignment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection is a crucial process in industrial manufacturing and has made significant advancements recently. However, there is a large variance between the data used in the development and the data collected by the production environment. Therefore, we present the Texture-AD benchmark based on representative texture-based anomaly detection to evaluate the effectiveness of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms in real-world applications. This dataset includes images of 15 different cloth, 14 semiconductor wafers and 10 metal plates acquired under different optical schemes. In addition, it includes more than 10 different types of defects produced during real manufacturing processes, such as scratches, wrinkles, color variations and point defects, which are often more difficult to detect than existing datasets. All anomalous areas are provided with pixel-level annotations to facilitate comprehensive evaluation using anomaly detection models. Specifically, to adapt to diverse products in automated pipelines, we present a new evaluation method and results of baseline algorithms. The experimental results show that Texture-AD is a difficult challenge for state-of-the-art algorithms. To our knowledge, Texture-AD is the first dataset to be devoted to evaluating industrial defect detection algorithms in the real world. The dataset is available at https://XXX.</description>

      <title>Distilling Generative-Discriminative Representations for Very Low-Resolution Face Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very low-resolution face recognition is challenging due to the serious loss of informative facial details in resolution degradation. In this paper, we propose a generative-discriminative representation distillation approach that combines generative representation with cross-resolution aligned knowledge distillation. This approach facilitates very low-resolution face recognition by jointly distilling generative and discriminative models via two distillation modules. Firstly, the generative representation distillation takes the encoder of a diffusion model pretrained for face super-resolution as the generative teacher to supervise the learning of the student backbone via feature regression, and then freezes the student backbone. After that, the discriminative representation distillation further considers a pretrained face recognizer as the discriminative teacher to supervise the learning of the student head via cross-resolution relational contrastive distillation. In this way, the general backbone representation can be transformed into discriminative head representation, leading to a robust and discriminative student model for very low-resolution face recognition. Our approach improves the recovery of the missing details in very low-resolution faces and achieves better knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on face datasets demonstrate that our approach enhances the recognition accuracy of very low-resolution faces, showcasing its effectiveness and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking in Neural Network Optimization: Insights from Input Dimension Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms behind neural network optimization is crucial for improving network design and performance. While various optimization techniques have been developed, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying principles that govern these techniques remains elusive. Specifically, the role of symmetry breaking, a fundamental concept in physics, has not been fully explored in neural network optimization. This gap in knowledge limits our ability to design networks that are both efficient and effective. Here, we propose the symmetry breaking hypothesis to elucidate the significance of symmetry breaking in enhancing neural network optimization. We demonstrate that a simple input expansion can significantly improve network performance across various tasks, and we show that this improvement can be attributed to the underlying symmetry breaking mechanism. We further develop a metric to quantify the degree of symmetry breaking in neural networks, providing a practical approach to evaluate and guide network design. Our findings confirm that symmetry breaking is a fundamental principle that underpins various optimization techniques, including dropout, batch normalization, and equivariance. By quantifying the degree of symmetry breaking, our work offers a practical technique for performance enhancement and a metric to guide network design without the need for complete datasets and extensive training processes.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Integration of Large Language Models in Industrial Test Maintenance Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much of the cost and effort required during the software testing process is invested in performing test maintenance - the addition, removal, or modification of test cases to keep the test suite in sync with the system-under-test or to otherwise improve its quality. Tool support could reduce the cost - and improve the quality - of test maintenance by automating aspects of the process or by providing guidance and support to developers.
  In this study, we explore the capabilities and applications of large language models (LLMs) - complex machine learning models adapted to textual analysis - to support test maintenance. We conducted a case study at Ericsson AB where we explored the triggers that indicate the need for test maintenance, the actions that LLMs can take, and the considerations that must be made when deploying LLMs in an industrial setting. We also proposed and demonstrated implementations of two multi-agent architectures that can predict which test cases require maintenance following a change to the source code. Collectively, these contributions advance our theoretical and practical understanding of how LLMs can be deployed to benefit industrial test maintenance processes.</description>

      <title>GeMuCo: Generalized Multisensory Correlational Model for Body Schema Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans can autonomously learn the relationship between sensation and motion in their own bodies, estimate and control their own body states, and move while continuously adapting to the current environment. On the other hand, current robots control their bodies by learning the network structure described by humans from their experiences, making certain assumptions on the relationship between sensors and actuators. In addition, the network model does not adapt to changes in the robot's body, the tools that are grasped, or the environment, and there is no unified theory, not only for control but also for state estimation, anomaly detection, simulation, and so on. In this study, we propose a Generalized Multisensory Correlational Model (GeMuCo), in which the robot itself acquires a body schema describing the correlation between sensors and actuators from its own experience, including model structures such as network input/output. The robot adapts to the current environment by updating this body schema model online, estimates and controls its body state, and even performs anomaly detection and simulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by applying it to tool-use considering changes in grasping state for an axis-driven robot, to joint-muscle mapping learning for a musculoskeletal robot, and to full-body tool manipulation for a low-rigidity plastic-made humanoid.</description>

      <title>Learning Generative Interactive Environments By Trained Agent Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: World models are increasingly pivotal in interpreting and simulating the rules and actions of complex environments. Genie, a recent model, excels at learning from visually diverse environments but relies on costly human-collected data. We observe that their alternative method of using random agents is too limited to explore the environment. We propose to improve the model by employing reinforcement learning based agents for data generation. This approach produces diverse datasets that enhance the model's ability to adapt and perform well across various scenarios and realistic actions within the environment. In this paper, we first release the model GenieRedux - an implementation based on Genie. Additionally, we introduce GenieRedux-G, a variant that uses the agent's readily available actions to factor out action prediction uncertainty during validation. Our evaluation, including a replication of the Coinrun case study, shows that GenieRedux-G achieves superior visual fidelity and controllability using the trained agent exploration. The proposed approach is reproducable, scalable and adaptable to new types of environments. Our codebase is available at https://github.com/insait-institute/GenieRedux .</description>

      <title>HexaCoder: Secure Code Generation via Oracle-Guided Synthetic Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential for automatic code generation and form the basis for various tools such as GitHub Copilot. However, recent studies highlight that many LLM-generated code contains serious security vulnerabilities. While previous work tries to address this by training models that generate secure code, these attempts remain constrained by limited access to training data and labor-intensive data preparation.
  In this paper, we introduce HexaCoder, a novel approach to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate secure codes by automatically synthesizing secure codes, which reduces the effort of finding suitable training data. HexaCoder comprises two key components: an oracle-guided data synthesis pipeline and a two-step process for secure code generation. The data synthesis pipeline generates pairs of vulnerable and fixed codes for specific Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types by utilizing a state-of-the-art LLM for repairing vulnerable code. A security oracle identifies vulnerabilities, and a state-of-the-art LLM repairs them by extending and/or editing the codes, creating data pairs for fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method. Each example of our fine-tuning dataset includes the necessary security-related libraries and code that form the basis of our novel two-step generation approach. This allows the model to integrate security-relevant libraries before generating the main code, significantly reducing the number of generated vulnerable codes by up to 85% compared to the baseline methods. We perform extensive evaluations on three different benchmarks for four LLMs, demonstrating that HexaCoder not only improves the security of the generated code but also maintains a high level of functional correctness.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Large Language Model Driven Scenario Testing for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of corner cases has become increasingly crucial for efficiently testing autonomous vehicles prior to road deployment. However, existing methods struggle to accommodate diverse testing requirements and often lack the ability to generalize to unseen situations, thereby reducing the convenience and usability of the generated scenarios. A method that facilitates easily controllable scenario generation for efficient autonomous vehicles (AV) testing with realistic and challenging situations is greatly needed. To address this, we proposed OmniTester: a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) based framework that fully leverages the extensive world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. OmniTester is designed to generate realistic and diverse scenarios within a simulation environment, offering a robust solution for testing and evaluating AVs. In addition to prompt engineering, we employ tools from Simulation of Urban Mobility to simplify the complexity of codes generated by LLMs. Furthermore, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented Generation and a self-improvement mechanism to enhance the LLM's understanding of scenarios, thereby increasing its ability to produce more realistic scenes. In the experiments, we demonstrated the controllability and realism of our approaches in generating three types of challenging and complex scenarios. Additionally, we showcased its effectiveness in reconstructing new scenarios described in crash report, driven by the generalization capability of LLMs.</description>

      <title>An Effective Context-Balanced Adaptation Approach for Long-Tailed Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have become standard practice for various commercial applications. However, in real-world scenarios, the long-tailed nature of word distribution often leads E2E ASR models to perform well on common words but fall short in recognizing uncommon ones. Recently, the notion of a contextual adapter (CA) was proposed to infuse external knowledge represented by a context word list into E2E ASR models. Although CA can improve recognition performance on rare words, two crucial data imbalance problems remain. First, when using low-frequency words as context words during training, since these words rarely occur in the utterance, CA becomes prone to overfit on attending to the &lt;no-context&gt; token due to higher-frequency words not being present in the context list. Second, the long-tailed distribution within the context list itself still causes the model to perform poorly on low-frequency context words. In light of this, we explore in-depth the impact of altering the context list to have words with different frequency distributions on model performance, and meanwhile extend CA with a simple yet effective context-balanced learning objective. A series of experiments conducted on the AISHELL-1 benchmark dataset suggests that using all vocabulary words from the training corpus as the context list and pairing them with our balanced objective yields the best performance, demonstrating a significant reduction in character error rate (CER) by up to 1.21% and a more pronounced 9.44% reduction in the error rate of zero-shot words.</description>

      <title>Elucidating Optimal Reward-Diversity Tradeoffs in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have become prominent tools for generating high-fidelity images from text prompts. However, when trained on unfiltered internet data, these models can produce unsafe, incorrect, or stylistically undesirable images that are not aligned with human preferences. To address this, recent approaches have incorporated human preference datasets to fine-tune T2I models or to optimize reward functions that capture these preferences. Although effective, these methods are vulnerable to reward hacking, where the model overfits to the reward function, leading to a loss of diversity in the generated images. In this paper, we prove the inevitability of reward hacking and study natural regularization techniques like KL divergence and LoRA scaling, and their limitations for diffusion models. We also introduce Annealed Importance Guidance (AIG), an inference-time regularization inspired by Annealed Importance Sampling, which retains the diversity of the base model while achieving Pareto-Optimal reward-diversity tradeoffs. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of AIG for Stable Diffusion models, striking the optimal balance between reward optimization and image diversity. Furthermore, a user study confirms that AIG improves diversity and quality of generated images across different model architectures and reward functions.</description>

      <title>Aligning Machine and Human Visual Representations across Abstraction Levels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved success across a wide range of applications, including as models of human behavior in vision tasks. However, neural network training and human learning differ in fundamental ways, and neural networks often fail to generalize as robustly as humans do, raising questions regarding the similarity of their underlying representations. What is missing for modern learning systems to exhibit more human-like behavior? We highlight a key misalignment between vision models and humans: whereas human conceptual knowledge is hierarchically organized from fine- to coarse-scale distinctions, model representations do not accurately capture all these levels of abstraction. To address this misalignment, we first train a teacher model to imitate human judgments, then transfer human-like structure from its representations into pretrained state-of-the-art vision foundation models. These human-aligned models more accurately approximate human behavior and uncertainty across a wide range of similarity tasks, including a new dataset of human judgments spanning multiple levels of semantic abstractions. They also perform better on a diverse set of machine learning tasks, increasing generalization and out-of-distribution robustness. Thus, infusing neural networks with additional human knowledge yields a best-of-both-worlds representation that is both more consistent with human cognition and more practically useful, thus paving the way toward more robust, interpretable, and human-like artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>Sine, Transient, Noise Neural Modeling of Piano Notes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for emulating piano sounds. We propose to exploit the sine, transient, and noise decomposition to design a differentiable spectral modeling synthesizer replicating piano notes. Three sub-modules learn these components from piano recordings and generate the corresponding harmonic, transient, and noise signals. Splitting the emulation into three independently trainable models reduces the modeling tasks' complexity. The quasi-harmonic content is produced using a differentiable sinusoidal model guided by physics-derived formulas, whose parameters are automatically estimated from audio recordings. The noise sub-module uses a learnable time-varying filter, and the transients are generated using a deep convolutional network. From singular notes, we emulate the coupling between different keys in trichords with a convolutional-based network. Results show the model matches the partial distribution of the target while predicting the energy in the higher part of the spectrum presents more challenges. The energy distribution in the spectra of the transient and noise components is accurate overall. While the model is more computationally and memory efficient, perceptual tests reveal limitations in accurately modeling the attack phase of notes. Despite this, it generally achieves perceptual accuracy in emulating single notes and trichords.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become a dominant approach in natural language processing, yet their internal knowledge structures remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we analyze the internal knowledge structures of LLMs using historical medal tallies from the Olympic Games. We task the models with providing the medal counts for each team and identifying which teams achieved specific rankings. Our results reveal that while state-of-the-art LLMs perform remarkably well in reporting medal counts for individual teams, they struggle significantly with questions about specific rankings. This suggests that the internal knowledge structures of LLMs are fundamentally different from those of humans, who can easily infer rankings from known medal counts. To support further research, we publicly release our code, dataset, and model outputs.</description>

Abstract: The correct adoption of cryptography APIs is challenging for mainstream developers, often resulting in widespread API misuse. Meanwhile, cryptography misuse detectors have demonstrated inconsistent performance and remain largely inaccessible to most developers. We investigated the extent to which ChatGPT can detect cryptography misuses and compared its performance with that of the state-of-the-art static analysis tools. Our investigation, mainly based on the CryptoAPI-Bench benchmark, demonstrated that ChatGPT is effective in identifying cryptography API misuses, and with the use of prompt engineering, it can even outperform leading static cryptography misuse detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper addresses a problem of sequential bilateral bargaining with incomplete information. We proposed a decision model that helps agents to successfully bargain by performing indirect negotiation and learning the opponent's model. Methodologically the paper casts heuristically-motivated bargaining of a self-interested independent player into a framework of Bayesian learning and Markov decision processes. The special form of the reward implicitly motivates the players to negotiate indirectly, via closed-loop interaction. We illustrate the approach by applying our model to the Nash demand game, which is an abstract model of bargaining. The results indicate that the established negotiation: i) leads to coordinating players' actions; ii) results in maximising success rate of the game and iii) brings more individual profit to the players.</description>

      <title>Quantifying and Enabling the Interpretability of CLIP-like Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CLIP is one of the most popular foundational models and is heavily used for many vision-language tasks. However, little is known about the inner workings of CLIP. To bridge this gap we propose a study to quantify the interpretability in CLIP like models. We conduct this study on six different CLIP models from OpenAI and OpenCLIP which vary by size, type of pre-training data and patch size. Our approach begins with using the TEXTSPAN algorithm and in-context learning to break down individual attention heads into specific properties. We then evaluate how easily these heads can be interpreted using new metrics which measure property consistency within heads and property disentanglement across heads. Our findings reveal that larger CLIP models are generally more interpretable than their smaller counterparts. To further assist users in understanding the inner workings of CLIP models, we introduce CLIP-InterpreT, a tool designed for interpretability analysis. CLIP-InterpreT offers five types of analyses: property-based nearest neighbor search, per-head topic segmentation, contrastive segmentation, per-head nearest neighbors of an image, and per-head nearest neighbors of text.</description>

      <title>Developing the Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network Model to Predict Hip Replacement using Electronic Health Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Hip replacement procedures improve patient lives by relieving pain and restoring mobility. Predicting hip replacement in advance could reduce pain by enabling timely interventions, prioritising individuals for surgery or rehabilitation, and utilising physiotherapy to potentially delay the need for joint replacement. This study predicts hip replacement a year in advance to enhance quality of life and health service efficiency. Methods: Adapting previous work using Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (TG-CNN) models, we construct temporal graphs from primary care medical event codes, sourced from ResearchOne EHRs of 40-75-year-old patients, to predict hip replacement risk. We match hip replacement cases to controls by age, sex, and Index of Multiple Deprivation. The model, trained on 9,187 cases and 9,187 controls, predicts hip replacement one year in advance. We validate the model on two unseen datasets, recalibrating for class imbalance. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study and compare against four baseline models. Results: Our best model predicts hip replacement risk one year in advance with an AUROC of 0.724 (95% CI: 0.715-0.733) and an AUPRC of 0.185 (95% CI: 0.160-0.209), achieving a calibration slope of 1.107 (95% CI: 1.074-1.139) after recalibration. Conclusions: The TG-CNN model effectively predicts hip replacement risk by identifying patterns in patient trajectories, potentially improving understanding and management of hip-related conditions.</description>

      <title>An Ontology-based Approach Towards Traceable Behavior Specifications in Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicles in public traffic that are equipped with Automated Driving Systems are subject to a number of expectations: Among other aspects, their behavior should be safe, conforming to the rules of the road and provide mobility to their users. This poses challenges for the developers of such systems: Developers are responsible for specifying this behavior, for example, in terms of requirements at system design time. As we will discuss in the article, this specification always involves the need for assumptions and trade-offs. As a result, insufficiencies in such a behavior specification can occur that can potentially lead to unsafe system behavior. In order to support the identification of specification insufficiencies, requirements and respective assumptions need to be made explicit. In this article, we propose the Semantic Norm Behavior Analysis as an ontology-based approach to specify the behavior for an Automated Driving System equipped vehicle. We use ontologies to formally represent specified behavior for a targeted operational environment, and to establish traceability between specified behavior and the addressed stakeholder needs. Furthermore, we illustrate the application of the Semantic Norm Behavior Analysis in two example scenarios and evaluate our results.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based Scenario Generation for Robust Hybrid AI for Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in search and rescue, emergency management, and law enforcement has gained traction with the advent of low-cost platforms and sensor payloads. The emergence of hybrid neural and symbolic AI approaches for complex reasoning is expected to further push the boundaries of these applications with decreasing levels of human intervention. However, current UAV simulation environments lack semantic context suited to this hybrid approach. To address this gap, HAMERITT (Hybrid Ai Mission Environment for RapId Training and Testing) provides a simulation-based autonomy software framework that supports the training, testing and assurance of neuro-symbolic algorithms for autonomous maneuver and perception reasoning. HAMERITT includes scenario generation capabilities that offer mission-relevant contextual symbolic information in addition to raw sensor data. Scenarios include symbolic descriptions for entities of interest and their relations to scene elements, as well as spatial-temporal constraints in the form of time-bounded areas of interest with prior probabilities and restricted zones within those areas. HAMERITT also features support for training distinct algorithm threads for maneuver vs. perception within an end-to-end mission run. Future work includes improving scenario realism and scaling symbolic context generation through automated workflow.</description>

      <title>Label-free Monitoring of Self-Supervised Learning Progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is an effective method for exploiting unlabelled data to learn a high-level embedding space that can be used for various downstream tasks. However, existing methods to monitor the quality of the encoder -- either during training for one model or to compare several trained models -- still rely on access to annotated data. When SSL methodologies are applied to new data domains, a sufficiently large labelled dataset may not always be available. In this study, we propose several evaluation metrics which can be applied on the embeddings of unlabelled data and investigate their viability by comparing them to linear probe accuracy (a common metric which utilizes an annotated dataset). In particular, we apply $k$-means clustering and measure the clustering quality with the silhouette score and clustering agreement. We also measure the entropy of the embedding distribution. We find that while the clusters did correspond better to the ground truth annotations as training of the network progressed, label-free clustering metrics correlated with the linear probe accuracy only when training with SSL methods SimCLR and MoCo-v2, but not with SimSiam. Additionally, although entropy did not always have strong correlations with LP accuracy, this appears to be due to instability arising from early training, with the metric stabilizing and becoming more reliable at later stages of learning. Furthermore, while entropy generally decreases as learning progresses, this trend reverses for SimSiam. More research is required to establish the cause for this unexpected behaviour. Lastly, we find that while clustering based approaches are likely only viable for same-architecture comparisons, entropy may be architecture-independent.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Imitation under Mismatched Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human demonstrations as prompts are a powerful way to program robots to do long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, directly translating such demonstrations into robot-executable actions poses significant challenges due to execution mismatches, such as different movement styles and physical capabilities. Existing methods either rely on robot-demonstrator paired data, which is infeasible to scale, or overly rely on frame-level visual similarities, which fail to hold. To address these challenges, we propose RHyME, a novel framework that automatically establishes task execution correspondences between the robot and the demonstrator by using optimal transport costs. Given long-horizon robot demonstrations, RHyME synthesizes semantically equivalent human demonstrations by retrieving and composing similar short-horizon human clips, facilitating effective policy training without the need for paired data. We show that RHyME outperforms a range of baselines across various cross-embodiment datasets on all degrees of mismatches. Through detailed analysis, we uncover insights for learning and leveraging cross-embodiment visual representations.</description>

      <title>A Practice of Post-Training on Llama-3 70B with Optimal Selection of Additional Language Mixture Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) often needs to be Continual Pre-Trained (CPT) to obtain the unfamiliar language skill or adapt into new domains. The huge training cost of CPT often asks for cautious choice of key hyper-parameters such as the mixture ratio of extra language or domain corpus. However, there is no systematic study which bridge the gap between the optimal mixture ratio and the actual model performance, and the gap between experimental scaling law and the actual deployment in the full model size. In this paper, we perform CPT on Llama-3 8B and 70B to enhance its Chinese ability. We study the optimal correlation between the Additional Language Mixture Ratio (ALMR) and the Learning Rate (LR) on the 8B size which directly indicate the optimal experimental set up. By thorough choice of hyper-parameter, and subsequent fine-tuning, the model capability is improved not only on the Chinese-related benchmark, but also some specific domains including math, coding and emotional intelligence. We deploy the final 70B version of LLM on an real-life chat system which obtain satisfying performance.</description>

      <title>MoWE-Audio: Multitask AudioLLMs with Mixture of Weak Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced natural language processing capabilities, facilitating the development of AudioLLMs that process and understand speech and audio inputs alongside text. Existing AudioLLMs typically combine a pre-trained audio encoder with a pre-trained LLM, which are subsequently finetuned on specific audio tasks. However, the pre-trained audio encoder has constrained capacity to capture features for new tasks and datasets. To address this, we propose to incorporate mixtures of `weak' encoders (MoWE) into the AudioLLM framework. MoWE supplements a base encoder with a pool of relatively light weight encoders, selectively activated based on the audio input to enhance feature extraction without significantly increasing model size. Our empirical results demonstrate that MoWE effectively improves multi-task performance, broadening the applicability of AudioLLMs to more diverse audio tasks.</description>

      <title>EyeCLIP: A visual-language foundation model for multi-modal ophthalmic image analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early detection of eye diseases like glaucoma, macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy is crucial for preventing vision loss. While artificial intelligence (AI) foundation models hold significant promise for addressing these challenges, existing ophthalmic foundation models primarily focus on a single modality, whereas diagnosing eye diseases requires multiple modalities. A critical yet often overlooked aspect is harnessing the multi-view information across various modalities for the same patient. Additionally, due to the long-tail nature of ophthalmic diseases, standard fully supervised or unsupervised learning approaches often struggle. Therefore, it is essential to integrate clinical text to capture a broader spectrum of diseases. We propose EyeCLIP, a visual-language foundation model developed using over 2.77 million multi-modal ophthalmology images with partial text data. To fully leverage the large multi-modal unlabeled and labeled data, we introduced a pretraining strategy that combines self-supervised reconstructions, multi-modal image contrastive learning, and image-text contrastive learning to learn a shared representation of multiple modalities. Through evaluation using 14 benchmark datasets, EyeCLIP can be transferred to a wide range of downstream tasks involving ocular and systemic diseases, achieving state-of-the-art performance in disease classification, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval. EyeCLIP represents a significant advancement over previous methods, especially showcasing few-shot, even zero-shot capabilities in real-world long-tail scenarios.</description>

      <title>World-Grounded Human Motion Recovery via Gravity-View Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for recovering world-grounded human motion from monocular video. The main challenge lies in the ambiguity of defining the world coordinate system, which varies between sequences. Previous approaches attempt to alleviate this issue by predicting relative motion in an autoregressive manner, but are prone to accumulating errors. Instead, we propose estimating human poses in a novel Gravity-View (GV) coordinate system, which is defined by the world gravity and the camera view direction. The proposed GV system is naturally gravity-aligned and uniquely defined for each video frame, largely reducing the ambiguity of learning image-pose mapping. The estimated poses can be transformed back to the world coordinate system using camera rotations, forming a global motion sequence. Additionally, the per-frame estimation avoids error accumulation in the autoregressive methods. Experiments on in-the-wild benchmarks demonstrate that our method recovers more realistic motion in both the camera space and world-grounded settings, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed.

      <title>LLaMA-Omni: Seamless Speech Interaction with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models like GPT-4o enable real-time interaction with large language models (LLMs) through speech, significantly enhancing user experience compared to traditional text-based interaction. However, there is still a lack of exploration on how to build speech interaction models based on open-source LLMs. To address this, we propose LLaMA-Omni, a novel model architecture designed for low-latency and high-quality speech interaction with LLMs. LLaMA-Omni integrates a pretrained speech encoder, a speech adaptor, an LLM, and a streaming speech decoder. It eliminates the need for speech transcription, and can simultaneously generate text and speech responses directly from speech instructions with extremely low latency. We build our model based on the latest Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model. To align the model with speech interaction scenarios, we construct a dataset named InstructS2S-200K, which includes 200K speech instructions and corresponding speech responses. Experimental results show that compared to previous speech-language models, LLaMA-Omni provides better responses in both content and style, with a response latency as low as 226ms. Additionally, training LLaMA-Omni takes less than 3 days on just 4 GPUs, paving the way for the efficient development of speech-language models in the future.</description>

      <title>Insuring Uninsurable Risks from AI: The State as Insurer of Last Resort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many experts believe that AI systems will sooner or later pose uninsurable risks, including existential risks. This creates an extreme judgment-proof problem: few if any parties can be held accountable ex post in the event of such a catastrophe. This paper proposes a novel solution: a government-provided, mandatory indemnification program for AI developers. The program uses risk-priced indemnity fees to induce socially optimal levels of care. Risk-estimates are determined by surveying experts, including indemnified developers. The Bayesian Truth Serum mechanism is employed to incent honest and effortful responses. Compared to alternatives, this approach arguably better leverages all private information, and provides a clearer signal to indemnified developers regarding what risks they must mitigate to lower their fees. It's recommended that collected fees be used to help fund the safety research developers need, employing a fund matching mechanism (Quadratic Financing) to induce an optimal supply of this public good. Under Quadratic Financing, safety research projects would compete for private contributions from developers, signaling how much each is to be supplemented with public funds.</description>

      <title>Liability and Insurance for Catastrophic Losses: the Nuclear Power Precedent and Lessons for AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI systems become more autonomous and capable, experts warn of them potentially causing catastrophic losses. Drawing on the successful precedent set by the nuclear power industry, this paper argues that developers of frontier AI models should be assigned limited, strict, and exclusive third party liability for harms resulting from Critical AI Occurrences (CAIOs) - events that cause or easily could have caused catastrophic losses. Mandatory insurance for CAIO liability is recommended to overcome developers' judgment-proofness, mitigate winner's curse dynamics, and leverage insurers' quasi-regulatory abilities. Based on theoretical arguments and observations from the analogous nuclear power context, insurers are expected to engage in a mix of causal risk-modeling, monitoring, lobbying for stricter regulation, and providing loss prevention guidance in the context of insuring against heavy-tail risks from AI. While not a substitute for regulation, clear liability assignment and mandatory insurance can help efficiently allocate resources to risk-modeling and safe design, facilitating future regulatory efforts.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Sub-Genre Classification For Mainstage Dance Music</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music classification, with a wide range of applications, is one of the most prominent tasks in music information retrieval. To address the absence of comprehensive datasets and high-performing methods in the classification of mainstage dance music, this work introduces a novel benchmark comprising a new dataset and a baseline. Our dataset extends the number of sub-genres to cover most recent mainstage live sets by top DJs worldwide in music festivals. A continuous soft labeling approach is employed to account for tracks that span multiple sub-genres, preserving the inherent sophistication. For the baseline, we developed deep learning models that outperform current state-of-the-art multimodel language models, which struggle to identify house music sub-genres, emphasizing the need for specialized models trained on fine-grained datasets. Our benchmark is applicable to serve for application scenarios such as music recommendation, DJ set curation, and interactive multimedia, where we also provide video demos.

      <title>Geometric-Averaged Preference Optimization for Soft Preference Labels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many algorithms for aligning LLMs with human preferences assume that human preferences are binary and deterministic. However, it is reasonable to think that they can vary with different individuals, and thus should be distributional to reflect the fine-grained relationship between the responses. In this work, we introduce the distributional soft preference labels and improve Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a weighted geometric average of the LLM output likelihood in the loss function. In doing so, the scale of learning loss is adjusted based on the soft labels, and the loss with equally preferred responses would be close to zero. This simple modification can be easily applied to any DPO family and helps the models escape from the over-optimization and objective mismatch prior works suffer from. In our experiments, we simulate the soft preference labels with AI feedback from LLMs and demonstrate that geometric averaging consistently improves performance on standard benchmarks for alignment research. In particular, we observe more preferable responses than binary labels and significant improvements with data where modestly-confident labels are in the majority.</description>

      <title>HybridFC: A Hybrid Fact-Checking Approach for Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider fact-checking approaches that aim to predict the veracity of assertions in knowledge graphs. Five main categories of fact-checking approaches for knowledge graphs have been proposed in the recent literature, of which each is subject to partially overlapping limitations. In particular, current text-based approaches are limited by manual feature engineering. Path-based and rule-based approaches are limited by their exclusive use of knowledge graphs as background knowledge, and embedding-based approaches suffer from low accuracy scores on current fact-checking tasks. We propose a hybrid approach -- dubbed HybridFC -- that exploits the diversity of existing categories of fact-checking approaches within an ensemble learning setting to achieve a significantly better prediction performance. In particular, our approach outperforms the state of the art by 0.14 to 0.27 in terms of Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve on the FactBench dataset. Our code is open-source and can be found at https://github.com/dice-group/HybridFC.</description>

      <title>Hint-AD: Holistically Aligned Interpretability in End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end architectures in autonomous driving (AD) face a significant challenge in interpretability, impeding human-AI trust. Human-friendly natural language has been explored for tasks such as driving explanation and 3D captioning. However, previous works primarily focused on the paradigm of declarative interpretability, where the natural language interpretations are not grounded in the intermediate outputs of AD systems, making the interpretations only declarative. In contrast, aligned interpretability establishes a connection between language and the intermediate outputs of AD systems. Here we introduce Hint-AD, an integrated AD-language system that generates language aligned with the holistic perception-prediction-planning outputs of the AD model. By incorporating the intermediate outputs and a holistic token mixer sub-network for effective feature adaptation, Hint-AD achieves desirable accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art results in driving language tasks including driving explanation, 3D dense captioning, and command prediction. To facilitate further study on driving explanation task on nuScenes, we also introduce a human-labeled dataset, Nu-X. Codes, dataset, and models will be publicly available.</description>

Abstract: Ambient intelligence refers to technological enhanced electronic environments which are both responsive and sensitive to the presence of people within their environment. Environments that are integrated with ambient intelligence tends to adapt to the needs of individuals within the environment in an unobtrusive manner in such a way as to enhance everyday life thereby making interaction with technology extremely seamless and well integrated. This capability was made possible because it is a concept that combines several key technologies such as IoT (Internet of Things) technology, sensor technology, AI (Artificial Intelligence), and advanced human-computer interaction all embedded and integrated together with the environment.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Uncertainty for Querying Inconsistent Description Logics Knowledge Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The necessity to manage inconsistency in Description Logics Knowledge Bases (KBs) has come to the fore with the increasing importance gained by the Semantic Web, where information comes from different sources that constantly change their content and may contain contradictory descriptions when considered either alone or together. Classical reasoning algorithms do not handle inconsistent KBs, forcing the debugging of the KB in order to remove the inconsistency. In this paper, we exploit an existing probabilistic semantics called DISPONTE to overcome this problem and allow queries also in case of inconsistent KBs. We implemented our approach in the reasoners TRILL and BUNDLE and empirically tested the validity of our proposal. Moreover, we formally compare the presented approach to that of the repair semantics, one of the most established semantics when considering DL reasoning tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06799v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced Earth sciences, yet its full potential in to comprehensively modeling Earth's complex dynamics remains unrealized. Geoscience foundation models (GFMs) emerge as a paradigm-shifting solution, integrating extensive cross-disciplinary data to enhance the simulation and understanding of Earth system dynamics. These data-centric AI models extract insights from petabytes of structured and unstructured data, effectively addressing the complexities of Earth systems that traditional models struggle to capture. The unique strengths of GFMs include flexible task specification, diverse input-output capabilities, and multi-modal knowledge representation, enabling analyses that surpass those of individual data sources or traditional AI methods. This review not only highlights the key advantages of GFMs, but also presents essential techniques for their construction, with a focus on transformers, pre-training, and adaptation strategies. Subsequently, we examine recent advancements in GFMs, including large language models, vision models, and vision-language models, particularly emphasizing the potential applications in remote sensing. Additionally, the review concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and future trends in GFMs, addressing five critical aspects: data integration, model complexity, uncertainty quantification, interdisciplinary collaboration, and concerns related to privacy, trust, and security. This review offers a comprehensive overview of emerging geoscientific research paradigms, emphasizing the untapped opportunities at the intersection of advanced AI techniques and geoscience. It examines major methodologies, showcases advances in large-scale models, and discusses the challenges and prospects that will shape the future landscape of GFMs.</description>

      <title>A Heterogeneous Graph-Based Multi-Task Learning for Fault Event Diagnosis in Smart Grid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise and timely fault diagnosis is a prerequisite for a distribution system to ensure minimum downtime and maintain reliable operation. This necessitates access to a comprehensive procedure that can provide the grid operators with insightful information in the case of a fault event. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous multi-task learning graph neural network (MTL-GNN) capable of detecting, locating and classifying faults in addition to providing an estimate of the fault resistance and current. Using a graph neural network (GNN) allows for learning the topological representation of the distribution system as well as feature learning through a message-passing scheme. We investigate the robustness of our proposed model using the IEEE-123 test feeder system. This work also proposes a novel GNN-based explainability method to identify key nodes in the distribution system which then facilitates informed sparse measurements. Numerical tests validate the performance of the model across all tasks.</description>

      <title>State-of-the-art review and synthesis: A requirement-based roadmap for standardized predictive maintenance automation using digital twin technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent digital advances have popularized predictive maintenance (PMx), offering enhanced efficiency, automation, accuracy, cost savings, and independence in maintenance processes. Yet, PMx continues to face numerous limitations such as poor explainability, sample inefficiency of data-driven methods, complexity of physics-based methods, and limited generalizability and scalability of knowledge-based methods. This paper proposes leveraging Digital Twins (DTs) to address these challenges and enable automated PMx adoption on a larger scale. While DTs have the potential to be transformative, they have not yet reached the maturity needed to bridge these gaps in a standardized manner. Without a standard definition guiding this evolution, the transformation lacks a solid foundation for development. This paper provides a requirement-based roadmap to support standardized PMx automation using DT technologies. Our systematic approach comprises two primary stages. First, we methodically identify the Informational Requirements (IRs) and Functional Requirements (FRs) for PMx, which serve as a foundation from which any unified framework must emerge. Our approach to defining and using IRs and FRs as the backbone of any PMx DT is supported by the proven success of these requirements as blueprints in other areas, such as product development in the software industry. Second, we conduct a thorough literature review across various fields to assess how these IRs and FRs are currently being applied within DTs, enabling us to identify specific areas where further research is needed to support the progress and maturation of requirement-based PMx DTs.</description>

      <title>Is Epistemic Uncertainty Faithfully Represented by Evidential Deep Learning Methods?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trustworthy ML systems should not only return accurate predictions, but also a reliable representation of their uncertainty. Bayesian methods are commonly used to quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, but alternative approaches, such as evidential deep learning methods, have become popular in recent years. The latter group of methods in essence extends empirical risk minimization (ERM) for predicting second-order probability distributions over outcomes, from which measures of epistemic (and aleatoric) uncertainty can be extracted. This paper presents novel theoretical insights of evidential deep learning, highlighting the difficulties in optimizing second-order loss functions and interpreting the resulting epistemic uncertainty measures. With a systematic setup that covers a wide range of approaches for classification, regression and counts, it provides novel insights into issues of identifiability and convergence in second-order loss minimization, and the relative (rather than absolute) nature of epistemic uncertainty measures.</description>

      <title>Sparse Attention Regression Network Based Soil Fertility Prediction With Ummaso</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The challenge of imbalanced soil nutrient datasets significantly hampers accurate predictions of soil fertility. To tackle this, a new method is suggested in this research, combining Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). The main aim is to counter the impact of uneven data distribution and improve soil fertility models' predictive precision. The model introduced uses Sparse Attention Regression, effectively incorporating pertinent features from the imbalanced dataset. UMAP is utilized initially to reduce data complexity, unveiling hidden structures and important patterns. Following this, LASSO is applied to refine features and enhance the model's interpretability. The experimental outcomes highlight the effectiveness of the UMAP and LASSO hybrid approach. The proposed model achieves outstanding performance metrics, reaching a predictive accuracy of 98%, demonstrating its capability in accurate soil fertility predictions. Additionally, it showcases a Precision of 91.25%, indicating its adeptness in identifying fertile soil instances accurately. The Recall metric stands at 90.90%, emphasizing the model's ability to capture true positive cases effectively.</description>

      <title>ADESSE: Advice Explanations in Complex Repeated Decision-Making Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of human-centered AI, fostering a synergistic relationship between humans and AI agents in decision-making processes stands as a paramount challenge. This work considers a problem setup where an intelligent agent comprising a neural network-based prediction component and a deep reinforcement learning component provides advice to a human decision-maker in complex repeated decision-making environments. Whether the human decision-maker would follow the agent's advice depends on their beliefs and trust in the agent and on their understanding of the advice itself. To this end, we developed an approach named ADESSE to generate explanations about the adviser agent to improve human trust and decision-making. Computational experiments on a range of environments with varying model sizes demonstrate the applicability and scalability of ADESSE. Furthermore, an interactive game-based user study shows that participants were significantly more satisfied, achieved a higher reward in the game, and took less time to select an action when presented with explanations generated by ADESSE. These findings illuminate the critical role of tailored, human-centered explanations in AI-assisted decision-making.</description>

Abstract: This work explores how to fine-tune large language models using prompt engineering techniques with contextual information for generating an accurate text description of the full story, ready to be forwarded to off-the-shelve speech synthesis tools. We propose to use existing computer vision and optical character recognition techniques to build a grounded context from the comic strip image content, such as panels, characters, text, reading order and the association of bubbles and characters. Then we infer character identification and generate comic book script with context-aware panel description including character's appearance, posture, mood, dialogues etc. We believe that such enriched content description can be easily used to produce audiobook and eBook with various voices for characters, captions and playing sound effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has achieved remarkable success in addressing the challenges of Large Language Models (LLMs) without necessitating retraining. By referencing an external knowledge base, RAG refines LLM outputs, effectively mitigating issues such as ``hallucination'', lack of domain-specific knowledge, and outdated information. However, the complex structure of relationships among different entities in databases presents challenges for RAG systems. In response, GraphRAG leverages structural information across entities to enable more precise and comprehensive retrieval, capturing relational knowledge and facilitating more accurate, context-aware responses. Given the novelty and potential of GraphRAG, a systematic review of current technologies is imperative. This paper provides the first comprehensive overview of GraphRAG methodologies. We formalize the GraphRAG workflow, encompassing Graph-Based Indexing, Graph-Guided Retrieval, and Graph-Enhanced Generation. We then outline the core technologies and training methods at each stage. Additionally, we examine downstream tasks, application domains, evaluation methodologies, and industrial use cases of GraphRAG. Finally, we explore future research directions to inspire further inquiries and advance progress in the field. In order to track recent progress in this field, we set up a repository at \url{https://github.com/pengboci/GraphRAG-Survey}.</description>

      <title>On Stateful Value Factorization in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Value factorization is a popular paradigm for designing scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. However, current factorization methods make choices without full justification that may limit their performance. For example, the theory in prior work uses stateless (i.e., history) functions, while the practical implementations use state information -- making the motivating theory a mismatch for the implementation. Also, methods have built off of previous approaches, inheriting their architectures without exploring other, potentially better ones. To address these concerns, we formally analyze the theory of using the state instead of the history in current methods -- reconnecting theory and practice. We then introduce DuelMIX, a factorization algorithm that learns distinct per-agent utility estimators to improve performance and achieve full expressiveness. Experiments on StarCraft II micromanagement and Box Pushing tasks demonstrate the benefits of our intuitions.</description>

      <title>Surrogate uncertainty estimation for your time series forecasting black-box: learn when to trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models play a vital role in time series forecasting. These models, however, often overlook an important element: point uncertainty estimates. Incorporating these estimates is crucial for effective risk management, informed model selection, and decision-making.To address this issue, our research introduces a method for uncertainty estimation. We employ a surrogate Gaussian process regression model. It enhances any base regression model with reasonable uncertainty estimates. This approach stands out for its computational efficiency. It only necessitates training one supplementary surrogate and avoids any data-specific assumptions. Furthermore, this method for work requires only the presence of the base model as a black box and its respective training data. The effectiveness of our approach is supported by experimental results. Using various time-series forecasting data, we found that our surrogate model-based technique delivers significantly more accurate confidence intervals. These techniques outperform both bootstrap-based and built-in methods in a medium-data regime. This superiority holds across a range of base model types, including a linear regression, ARIMA, gradient boosting and a neural network.</description>

      <title>System Neural Diversity: Measuring Behavioral Heterogeneity in Multi-Agent Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary science provides evidence that diversity confers resilience in natural systems. Yet, traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques commonly enforce homogeneity to increase training sample efficiency. When a system of learning agents is not constrained to homogeneous policies, individuals may develop diverse behaviors, resulting in emergent complementarity that benefits the system. Despite this, there is a surprising lack of tools that quantify behavioral diversity. Such techniques would pave the way towards understanding the impact of diversity in collective artificial intelligence and enabling its control. In this paper, we introduce System Neural Diversity (SND): a measure of behavioral heterogeneity in multi-agent systems. We discuss and prove its theoretical properties, and compare it with alternate, state-of-the-art behavioral diversity metrics used in the robotics domain. Through simulations of a variety of cooperative multi-robot tasks, we show how our metric constitutes an important tool that enables measurement and control of behavioral heterogeneity. In dynamic tasks, where the problem is affected by repeated disturbances during training, we show that SND allows us to measure latent resilience skills acquired by the agents, while other proxies, such as task performance (reward), fail to. Finally, we show how the metric can be employed to control diversity, allowing us to enforce a desired heterogeneity set-point or range. We demonstrate how this paradigm can be used to bootstrap the exploration phase, finding optimal policies faster, thus enabling novel and more efficient MARL paradigms.</description>

      <title>DNN-Defender: A Victim-Focused In-DRAM Defense Mechanism for Taming Adversarial Weight Attack on DNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With deep learning deployed in many security-sensitive areas, machine learning security is becoming progressively important. Recent studies demonstrate attackers can exploit system-level techniques exploiting the RowHammer vulnerability of DRAM to deterministically and precisely flip bits in Deep Neural Networks (DNN) model weights to affect inference accuracy. The existing defense mechanisms are software-based, such as weight reconstruction requiring expensive training overhead or performance degradation. On the other hand, generic hardware-based victim-/aggressor-focused mechanisms impose expensive hardware overheads and preserve the spatial connection between victim and aggressor rows. In this paper, we present the first DRAM-based victim-focused defense mechanism tailored for quantized DNNs, named DNN-Defender that leverages the potential of in-DRAM swapping to withstand the targeted bit-flip attacks with a priority protection mechanism. Our results indicate that DNN-Defender can deliver a high level of protection downgrading the performance of targeted RowHammer attacks to a random attack level. In addition, the proposed defense has no accuracy drop on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets without requiring any software training or incurring hardware overhead.</description>

      <title>INFLECT-DGNN: Influencer Prediction with Dynamic Graph Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Leveraging network information for predictive modeling has become widespread in many domains. Within the realm of referral and targeted marketing, influencer detection stands out as an area that could greatly benefit from the incorporation of dynamic network representation due to the continuous evolution of customer-brand relationships. In this paper, we present INFLECT-DGNN, a new method for profit-driven INFLuencer prEdiCTion with Dynamic Graph Neural Networks that innovatively combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with weighted loss functions, synthetic minority oversampling adapted to graph data, and a carefully crafted rolling-window strategy. We introduce a novel profit-driven framework that supports decision-making based on model predictions. To test the framework, we use a unique corporate dataset with diverse networks, capturing the customer interactions across three cities with different socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Our results show how using RNNs to encode temporal attributes alongside GNNs significantly improves predictive performance, while the profit-driven framework determines the optimal classification threshold for profit maximization. We compare the results of different models to demonstrate the importance of capturing network representation, temporal dependencies, and using a profit-driven evaluation. Our research has significant implications for the fields of referral and targeted marketing, expanding the technical use of deep graph learning within corporate environments.</description>

      <title>NeFL: Nested Model Scaling for Federated Learning with System Heterogeneous Clients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables distributed training while preserving data privacy, but stragglers-slow or incapable clients-can significantly slow down the total training time and degrade performance. To mitigate the impact of stragglers, system heterogeneity, including heterogeneous computing and network bandwidth, has been addressed. While previous studies have addressed system heterogeneity by splitting models into submodels, they offer limited flexibility in model architecture design, without considering potential inconsistencies arising from training multiple submodel architectures. We propose nested federated learning (NeFL), a generalized framework that efficiently divides deep neural networks into submodels using both depthwise and widthwise scaling. To address the inconsistency arising from training multiple submodel architectures, NeFL decouples a subset of parameters from those being trained for each submodel. An averaging method is proposed to handle these decoupled parameters during aggregation. NeFL enables resource-constrained devices to effectively participate in the FL pipeline, facilitating larger datasets for model training. Experiments demonstrate that NeFL achieves performance gain, especially for the worst-case submodel compared to baseline approaches (7.63% improvement on CIFAR-100). Furthermore, NeFL aligns with recent advances in FL, such as leveraging pre-trained models and accounting for statistical heterogeneity. Our code is available online.</description>

      <title>Feedback-guided Data Synthesis for Imbalanced Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current status quo in machine learning is to use static datasets of real images for training, which often come from long-tailed distributions. With the recent advances in generative models, researchers have started augmenting these static datasets with synthetic data, reporting moderate performance improvements on classification tasks. We hypothesize that these performance gains are limited by the lack of feedback from the classifier to the generative model, which would promote the usefulness of the generated samples to improve the classifier's performance. In this work, we introduce a framework for augmenting static datasets with useful synthetic samples, which leverages one-shot feedback from the classifier to drive the sampling of the generative model. In order for the framework to be effective, we find that the samples must be close to the support of the real data of the task at hand, and be sufficiently diverse. We validate three feedback criteria on a long-tailed dataset (ImageNet-LT) as well as a group-imbalanced dataset (NICO++). On ImageNet-LT, we achieve state-of-the-art results, with over 4 percent improvement on underrepresented classes while being twice efficient in terms of the number of generated synthetic samples. NICO++ also enjoys marked boosts of over 5 percent in worst group accuracy. With these results, our framework paves the path towards effectively leveraging state-of-the-art text-to-image models as data sources that can be queried to improve downstream applications.</description>

      <title>Greedy Perspectives: Multi-Drone View Planning for Collaborative Perception in Cluttered Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10863v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deployment of teams of aerial robots could enable large-scale filming of dynamic groups of people (actors) in complex environments for applications in areas such as team sports and cinematography. Toward this end, methods for submodular maximization via sequential greedy planning can enable scalable optimization of camera views across teams of robots but face challenges with efficient coordination in cluttered environments. Obstacles can produce occlusions and increase chances of inter-robot collision which can violate requirements for near-optimality guarantees. To coordinate teams of aerial robots in filming groups of people in dense environments, a more general view-planning approach is required. We explore how collision and occlusion impact performance in filming applications through the development of a multi-robot multi-actor view planner with an occlusion-aware objective for filming groups of people and compare with a formation planner and a greedy planner that ignores inter-robot collisions. We evaluate our approach based on five test environments and complex multi-actor behaviors. Compared with a formation planner, our sequential planner generates 14% greater view reward for filming the actors in three scenarios and comparable performance to formation planning on two others. We also observe near identical view rewards for sequential planning both with and without inter-robot collision constraints which indicates that robots are able to avoid collisions without impairing performance in the perception task. Overall, we demonstrate effective coordination of teams of aerial robots in environments cluttered with obstacles that may cause collisions or occlusions and for filming groups that may split, merge, or spread apart.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Focal and Full-Range Attention Based Graph Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paradigm of Transformers using the self-attention mechanism has manifested its advantage in learning graph-structured data. Yet, Graph Transformers are capable of modeling full range dependencies but are often deficient in extracting information from locality. A common practice is to utilize Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) as an auxiliary to capture local information, which however are still inadequate for comprehending substructures. In this paper, we present a purely attention-based architecture, namely Focal and Full-Range Graph Transformer (FFGT), which can mitigate the loss of local information in learning global correlations. The core component of FFGT is a new mechanism of compound attention, which combines the conventional full-range attention with K-hop focal attention on ego-nets to aggregate both global and local information. Beyond the scope of canonical Transformers, the FFGT has the merit of being more substructure-aware. Our approach enhances the performance of existing Graph Transformers on various open datasets, while achieves compatible SOTA performance on several Long-Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB) datasets even with a vanilla transformer. We further examine influential factors on the optimal focal length of attention via introducing a novel synthetic dataset based on SBM-PATTERN.</description>

      <title>vTrain: A Simulation Framework for Evaluating Cost-effective and Compute-optimal Large Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become widespread in various application domains, a critical challenge the AI community is facing is how to train these large AI models in a cost-effective manner. Existing LLM training plans typically employ a heuristic based parallel training strategy which is based on empirical observations rather than grounded upon a thorough examination of the search space of LLM parallelization. Such limitation renders existing systems to leave significant performance left on the table, wasting millions of dollars worth of training cost. This paper presents our profiling-driven simulator called vTrain, providing AI practitioners a fast yet accurate software framework to determine an efficient and cost-effective LLM training system configuration. We demonstrate vTrain's practicality through several case studies, e.g., effectively evaluating optimal training parallelization strategies that balances training time and its associated training cost, efficient multi-tenant GPU cluster schedulers targeting multiple LLM training jobs, and determining a compute-optimal LLM model architecture given a fixed compute budget.</description>

      <title>The Benefits of a Concise Chain of Thought on Problem-Solving in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Concise Chain-of-Thought (CCoT) prompting. We compared standard CoT and CCoT prompts to see how conciseness impacts response length and correct-answer accuracy. We evaluated this using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with a multiple-choice question-and-answer (MCQA) benchmark. CCoT reduced average response length by 48.70% for both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 while having a negligible impact on problem-solving performance. However, on math problems, GPT-3.5 with CCoT incurs a performance penalty of 27.69%. Overall, CCoT leads to an average per-token cost reduction of 22.67%.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Sharpness-aware Minimization Through A Simple Renormalization Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has attracted much attention because of its surprising effectiveness in improving generalization performance. However, compared to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), it is more prone to getting stuck at the saddle points, which as a result may lead to performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose a simple renormalization strategy, dubbed Stable SAM (SSAM), so that the gradient norm of the descent step maintains the same as that of the ascent step. Our strategy is easy to implement and flexible enough to integrate with SAM and its variants, almost at no computational cost. With elementary tools from convex optimization and learning theory, we also conduct a theoretical analysis of sharpness-aware training, revealing that compared to SGD, the effectiveness of SAM is only assured in a limited regime of learning rate. In contrast, we show how SSAM extends this regime of learning rate and then it can consistently perform better than SAM with the minor modification. Finally, we demonstrate the improved performance of SSAM on several representative data sets and tasks.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Self-Supervised Learning for Non-Sequential Tabular Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01204v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been incorporated into many state-of-the-art models in various domains, where SSL defines pretext tasks based on unlabeled datasets to learn contextualized and robust representations. Recently, SSL has become a new trend in exploring the representation learning capability in the realm of tabular data, which is more challenging due to not having explicit relations for learning descriptive representations. This survey aims to systematically review and summarize the recent progress and challenges of SSL for non-sequential tabular data (SSL4NS-TD). We first present a formal definition of NS-TD and clarify its correlation to related studies. Then, these approaches are categorized into three groups - predictive learning, contrastive learning, and hybrid learning, with their motivations and strengths of representative methods in each direction. Moreover, application issues of SSL4NS-TD are presented, including automatic data engineering, cross-table transferability, and domain knowledge integration. In addition, we elaborate on existing benchmarks and datasets for NS-TD applications to analyze the performance of existing tabular models. Finally, we discuss the challenges of SSL4NS-TD and provide potential directions for future research. We expect our work to be useful in terms of encouraging more research on lowering the barrier to entry SSL for the tabular domain, and of improving the foundations for implicit tabular data.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Learn Independent Causal Mechanisms?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite impressive performance on language modelling and complex reasoning tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) fall short on the same tasks in uncommon settings or with distribution shifts, exhibiting a lack of generalisation ability. By contrast, systems such as causal models, that learn abstract variables and causal relationships, can demonstrate increased robustness against changes in the distribution. One reason for this success is the existence and use of Independent Causal Mechanisms (ICMs) representing high-level concepts that only sparsely interact. In this work, we apply two concepts from causality to learn ICMs within LLMs. We develop a new LLM architecture composed of multiple sparsely interacting language modelling modules. We show that such causal constraints can improve out-of-distribution performance on abstract and causal reasoning tasks. We also investigate the level of independence and domain specialisation and show that LLMs rely on pre-trained partially domain-invariant mechanisms resilient to fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Extending 6D Object Pose Estimators for Stereo Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of objects accurately, quickly, and robustly remains a difficult task. However, recent methods for directly regressing poses from RGB images using dense features have achieved state-of-the-art results. Stereo vision, which provides an additional perspective on the object, can help reduce pose ambiguity and occlusion. Moreover, stereo can directly infer the distance of an object, while mono-vision requires internalized knowledge of the object's size. To extend the state-of-the-art in 6D object pose estimation to stereo, we created a BOP compatible stereo version of the YCB-V dataset. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation algorithms by utilizing stereo vision and can easily be adopted for other dense feature-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>User-LLM: Efficient LLM Contextualization with User Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, but effectively incorporating complex and potentially noisy user timeline data into LLMs remains a challenge. Current approaches often involve translating user timelines into text descriptions before feeding them to LLMs, which can be inefficient and may not fully capture the nuances of user behavior. Inspired by how LLMs are effectively integrated with images through direct embeddings, we propose User-LLM, a novel framework that leverages user embeddings to directly contextualize LLMs with user history interactions. These embeddings, generated by a user encoder pretrained using self-supervised learning on diverse user interactions, capture latent user behaviors and interests as well as their evolution over time. We integrate these user embeddings with LLMs through cross-attention, enabling LLMs to dynamically adapt their responses based on the context of a user's past actions and preferences.
  Our approach achieves significant efficiency gains by representing user timelines directly as embeddings, leading to substantial inference speedups of up to 78.1X. Comprehensive experiments on MovieLens, Amazon Review, and Google Local Review datasets demonstrate that User-LLM outperforms text-prompt-based contextualization on tasks requiring deep user understanding, with improvements of up to 16.33%, particularly excelling on long sequences that capture subtle shifts in user behavior. Furthermore, the incorporation of Perceiver layers streamlines the integration between user encoders and LLMs, yielding additional computational savings.</description>

      <title>Particip-AI: A Democratic Surveying Framework for Anticipating Future AI Use Cases, Harms and Benefits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14791v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General purpose AI, such as ChatGPT, seems to have lowered the barriers for the public to use AI and harness its power. However, the governance and development of AI still remain in the hands of a few, and the pace of development is accelerating without a comprehensive assessment of risks. As a first step towards democratic risk assessment and design of general purpose AI, we introduce PARTICIP-AI, a carefully designed framework for laypeople to speculate and assess AI use cases and their impacts. Our framework allows us to study more nuanced and detailed public opinions on AI through collecting use cases, surfacing diverse harms through risk assessment under alternate scenarios (i.e., developing and not developing a use case), and illuminating tensions over AI development through making a concluding choice on its development. To showcase the promise of our framework towards informing democratic AI development, we run a medium-scale study with inputs from 295 demographically diverse participants. Our analyses show that participants' responses emphasize applications for personal life and society, contrasting with most current AI development's business focus. We also surface diverse set of envisioned harms such as distrust in AI and institutions, complementary to those defined by experts. Furthermore, we found that perceived impact of not developing use cases significantly predicted participants' judgements of whether AI use cases should be developed, and highlighted lay users' concerns of techno-solutionism. We conclude with a discussion on how frameworks like PARTICIP-AI can further guide democratic AI development and governance.</description>

      <title>SPMamba: State-space model is all you need in speech separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing CNN-based speech separation models face local receptive field limitations and cannot effectively capture long time dependencies. Although LSTM and Transformer-based speech separation models can avoid this problem, their high complexity makes them face the challenge of computational resources and inference efficiency when dealing with long audio. To address this challenge, we introduce an innovative speech separation method called SPMamba. This model builds upon the robust TF-GridNet architecture, replacing its traditional BLSTM modules with bidirectional Mamba modules. These modules effectively model the spatiotemporal relationships between the time and frequency dimensions, allowing SPMamba to capture long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity. Specifically, the bidirectional processing within the Mamba modules enables the model to utilize both past and future contextual information, thereby enhancing separation performance. Extensive experiments conducted on public datasets, including WSJ0-2Mix, WHAM!, and Libri2Mix, as well as the newly constructed Echo2Mix dataset, demonstrated that SPMamba significantly outperformed existing state-of-the-art models, achieving superior results while also reducing computational complexity. These findings highlighted the effectiveness of SPMamba in tackling the intricate challenges of speech separation in complex environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the pre-training of music. While the prevalent use of MIDI in music modeling is well-established, our findings suggest that LLMs are inherently more compatible with ABC Notation, which aligns more closely with their design and strengths, thereby enhancing the model's performance in musical composition. To address the challenges associated with misaligned measures from different tracks during generation, we propose the development of a Synchronized Multi-Track ABC Notation (SMT-ABC Notation), which aims to preserve coherence across multiple musical tracks. Our contributions include a series of models capable of handling up to 8192 tokens, covering 90% of the symbolic music data in our training set. Furthermore, we explore the implications of the Symbolic Music Scaling Law (SMS Law) on model performance. The results indicate a promising direction for future research in music generation, offering extensive resources for community-led research through our open-source contributions.</description>

      <title>Relational Prompt-based Pre-trained Language Models for Social Event Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social Event Detection (SED) aims to identify significant events from social streams, and has a wide application ranging from public opinion analysis to risk management. In recent years, Graph Neural Network (GNN) based solutions have achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, GNN-based methods often struggle with missing and noisy edges between messages, affecting the quality of learned message embedding. Moreover, these methods statically initialize node embedding before training, which, in turn, limits the ability to learn from message texts and relations simultaneously. In this paper, we approach social event detection from a new perspective based on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), and present RPLM_SED (Relational prompt-based Pre-trained Language Models for Social Event Detection). We first propose a new pairwise message modeling strategy to construct social messages into message pairs with multi-relational sequences. Secondly, a new multi-relational prompt-based pairwise message learning mechanism is proposed to learn more comprehensive message representation from message pairs with multi-relational prompts using PLMs. Thirdly, we design a new clustering constraint to optimize the encoding process by enhancing intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster dispersion, making the message representation more distinguishable. We evaluate the RPLM_SED on three real-world datasets, demonstrating that the RPLM_SED model achieves state-of-the-art performance in offline, online, low-resource, and long-tail distribution scenarios for social event detection tasks.</description>

      <title>Explanation as a Watermark: Towards Harmless and Multi-bit Model Ownership Verification via Watermarking Feature Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ownership verification is currently the most critical and widely adopted post-hoc method to safeguard model copyright. In general, model owners exploit it to identify whether a given suspicious third-party model is stolen from them by examining whether it has particular properties `inherited' from their released models. Currently, backdoor-based model watermarks are the primary and cutting-edge methods to implant such properties in the released models. However, backdoor-based methods have two fatal drawbacks, including harmfulness and ambiguity. The former indicates that they introduce maliciously controllable misclassification behaviors ($i.e.$, backdoor) to the watermarked released models. The latter denotes that malicious users can easily pass the verification by finding other misclassified samples, leading to ownership ambiguity.
  In this paper, we argue that both limitations stem from the `zero-bit' nature of existing watermarking schemes, where they exploit the status ($i.e.$, misclassified) of predictions for verification. Motivated by this understanding, we design a new watermarking paradigm, $i.e.$, Explanation as a Watermark (EaaW), that implants verification behaviors into the explanation of feature attribution instead of model predictions. Specifically, EaaW embeds a `multi-bit' watermark into the feature attribution explanation of specific trigger samples without changing the original prediction. We correspondingly design the watermark embedding and extraction algorithms inspired by explainable artificial intelligence. In particular, our approach can be used for different tasks ($e.g.$, image classification and text generation). Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and harmlessness of our EaaW and its resistance to potential attacks.</description>

      <title>Concealing Backdoor Model Updates in Federated Learning by Trigger-Optimized Data Poisoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning method that enables participants to collaboratively train a model without sharing their private data. Despite its privacy and scalability benefits, FL is susceptible to backdoor attacks, where adversaries poison the local training data of a subset of clients using a backdoor trigger, aiming to make the aggregated model produce malicious results when the same backdoor condition is met by an inference-time input. Existing backdoor attacks in FL suffer from common deficiencies: fixed trigger patterns and reliance on the assistance of model poisoning. State-of-the-art defenses based on analyzing clients' model updates exhibit a good defense performance on these attacks because of the significant divergence between malicious and benign client model updates. To effectively conceal malicious model updates among benign ones, we propose DPOT, a backdoor attack strategy in FL that dynamically constructs backdoor objectives by optimizing a backdoor trigger, making backdoor data have minimal effect on model updates. We provide theoretical justifications for DPOT's attacking principle and display experimental results showing that DPOT, via only a data-poisoning attack, effectively undermines state-of-the-art defenses and outperforms existing backdoor attack techniques on various datasets.</description>

      <title>Deeper-PINNs: Element-wise Multiplication Based Physics-informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a promising framework for resolving partial differential equations (PDEs), physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have received widespread attention from industrial and scientific fields. However, lack of expressive ability and initialization pathology issues are found to prevent the application of PINNs in complex PDEs. In this work, we propose Deeper Physics-Informed Neural Network (Deeper-PINN) to resolve these issues. The element-wise multiplication operation is adopted to transform features into high-dimensional, non-linear spaces. Benefiting from element-wise multiplication operation, Deeper-PINNs can alleviate the initialization pathologies of PINNs and enhance the expressive capability of PINNs. The proposed structure is verified on various benchmarks. The results show that Deeper-PINNs can effectively resolve the initialization pathology and exhibit strong expressive ability.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Open-Source Framework for Assessing QoE in Multimedia Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Internet is integral to modern life, influencing communication, business, and lifestyles globally. As dependence on Internet services grows, the demand for high-quality service delivery increases. Service providers must maintain high standards of quality of service and quality of experience (QoE) to ensure user satisfaction. QoE, which reflects user satisfaction with service quality, is a key metric for multimedia services, yet it is challenging to measure due to its subjective nature and the complexities of real-time feedback. This paper introduces a machine learning-based framework for objectively assessing QoE in multimedia networks. The open-source framework complies with the ITU-T P.1203 standard. It automates data collection and user satisfaction prediction using key network parameters such as delay, jitter, packet loss, bitrate, and throughput. Using a dataset of over 20,000 records from various network conditions, the Random Forest model predicts the mean opinion score with 95.8% accuracy. Our framework addresses the limitations of existing QoE models by integrating real-time data collection, machine learning predictions, and adherence to international standards. This approach enhances QoE evaluation accuracy and allows dynamic network resource management, optimizing performance and cost-efficiency. Its open-source nature encourages adaptation and extension for various multimedia services. The findings significantly affect the telecommunications industry in managing and optimizing multimedia services. The network centric QoE prediction of the framework offers a scalable solution to improve user satisfaction without the need for content-specific data. Future enhancements could include advanced machine learning models and broader applicability to digital services. This research contributes a practical, standardized tool for QoE assessment across diverse networks and platforms.</description>

      <title>Identifiable Exchangeable Mechanisms for Causal Structure and Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying latent representations or causal structures is important for good generalization and downstream task performance. However, both fields have been developed rather independently. We observe that several methods in both representation and causal structure learning rely on the same data-generating process (DGP), namely, exchangeable but not i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) data. We provide a unified framework, termed Identifiable Exchangeable Mechanisms (IEM), for representation and structure learning under the lens of exchangeability. IEM provides new insights that let us relax the necessary conditions for causal structure identification in exchangeable non--i.i.d. data. We also demonstrate the existence of a duality condition in identifiable representation learning, leading to new identifiability results. We hope this work will pave the way for further research in causal representation learning.</description>

      <title>STD-PLM: Understanding Both Spatial and Temporal Properties of Spatial-Temporal Data with PLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial-temporal forecasting and imputation are important for real-world intelligent systems. Most existing methods are tailored for individual forecasting or imputation tasks but are not designed for both. Additionally, they are less effective for zero-shot and few-shot learning. While pre-trained language model (PLM) have exhibited strong pattern recognition and reasoning abilities across various tasks, including few-shot and zero-shot learning, their applications in spatial-temporal data understanding has been constrained by insufficient modeling of complex correlations such as the temporal correlations, spatial connectivity, non-pairwise and high-order spatial-temporal correlations within data. In this paper, we propose STD-PLM for understanding both spatial and temporal properties of \underline{S}patial-\underline{T}emporal \underline{D}ata with \underline{PLM}, which is capable of implementing both spatial-temporal forecasting and imputation tasks. STD-PLM understands spatial-temporal correlations via explicitly designed spatial and temporal tokenizers. Topology-aware node embeddings are designed for PLM to comprehend and exploit the topology structure of data in inductive manner. Furthermore, to mitigate the efficiency issues introduced by the PLM, we design a sandglass attention module (SGA) combined with a specific constrained loss function, which significantly improves the model's efficiency while ensuring performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STD-PLM exhibits competitive performance and generalization capabilities across the forecasting and imputation tasks on various datasets. Moreover, STD-PLM achieves promising results on both few-shot and zero-shot tasks.The code is made available at \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/STD-PLM-F3BA}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/STD-PLM-F3BA}</description>

      <title>Check-Eval: A Checklist-based Approach for Evaluating Text Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the quality of text generated by large language models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge. Traditional metrics often fail to align well with human judgments, particularly in tasks requiring creativity and nuance. In this paper, we propose \textsc{Check-Eval}, a novel evaluation framework leveraging LLMs to assess the quality of generated text through a checklist-based approach. \textsc{Check-Eval} can be employed as both a reference-free and reference-dependent evaluation method, providing a structured and interpretable assessment of text quality. The framework consists of two main stages: checklist generation and checklist evaluation. We validate \textsc{Check-Eval} on two benchmark datasets: Portuguese Legal Semantic Textual Similarity and \textsc{SummEval}. Our results demonstrate that \textsc{Check-Eval} achieves higher correlations with human judgments compared to existing metrics, such as \textsc{G-Eval} and \textsc{GPTScore}, underscoring its potential as a more reliable and effective evaluation framework for natural language generation tasks. The code for our experiments is available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/check-eval-0DB4}</description>

      <title>LLMmap: Fingerprinting For Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce LLMmap, a first-generation fingerprinting technique targeted at LLM-integrated applications. LLMmap employs an active fingerprinting approach, sending carefully crafted queries to the application and analyzing the responses to identify the specific LLM version in use. Our query selection is informed by domain expertise on how LLMs generate uniquely identifiable responses to thematically varied prompts. With as few as 8 interactions, LLMmap can accurately identify 42 different LLM versions with over 95% accuracy. More importantly, LLMmap is designed to be robust across different application layers, allowing it to identify LLM versions--whether open-source or proprietary--from various vendors, operating under various unknown system prompts, stochastic sampling hyperparameters, and even complex generation frameworks such as RAG or Chain-of-Thought. We discuss potential mitigations and demonstrate that, against resourceful adversaries, effective countermeasures may be challenging or even unrealizable.</description>

      <title>Rome was Not Built in a Single Step: Hierarchical Prompting for LLM-based Chip Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are effective in computer hardware synthesis via hardware description language (HDL) generation. However, LLM-assisted approaches for HDL generation struggle when handling complex tasks. We introduce a suite of hierarchical prompting techniques which facilitate efficient stepwise design methods, and develop a generalizable automation pipeline for the process. To evaluate these techniques, we present a benchmark set of hardware designs which have solutions with or without architectural hierarchy. Using these benchmarks, we compare various open-source and proprietary LLMs, including our own fine-tuned Code Llama-Verilog model. Our hierarchical methods automatically produce successful designs for complex hardware modules that standard flat prompting methods cannot achieve, allowing smaller open-source LLMs to compete with large proprietary models. Hierarchical prompting reduces HDL generation time and yields savings on LLM costs. Our experiments detail which LLMs are capable of which applications, and how to apply hierarchical methods in various modes. We explore case studies of generating complex cores using automatic scripted hierarchical prompts, including the first-ever LLM-designed processor with no human feedback. Tools for the Recurrent Optimization via Machine Editing (ROME) method can be found at https://github.com/ajn313/ROME-LLM</description>

      <title>Probabilistic energy forecasting through quantile regression in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate energy demand forecasting is crucial for sustainable and resilient energy development. To meet the Net Zero Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) $4.5$ scenario in the DACH countries, increased renewable energy production, energy storage, and reduced commercial building consumption are needed. This scenario's success depends on hydroelectric capacity and climatic factors. Informed decisions require quantifying uncertainty in forecasts. This study explores a non-parametric method based on \emph{reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS)}, known as kernel quantile regression, for energy prediction. Our experiments demonstrate its reliability and sharpness, and we benchmark it against state-of-the-art methods in load and price forecasting for the DACH region. We offer our implementation in conjunction with additional scripts to ensure the reproducibility of our research.</description>

      <title>VITA: Towards Open-Source Interactive Omni Multimodal LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable multimodal capabilities and interactive experience of GPT-4o underscore their necessity in practical applications, yet open-source models rarely excel in both areas. In this paper, we introduce VITA, the first-ever open-source Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adept at simultaneous processing and analysis of Video, Image, Text, and Audio modalities, and meanwhile has an advanced multimodal interactive experience. Starting from Mixtral 8x7B as a language foundation, we expand its Chinese vocabulary followed by bilingual instruction tuning. We further endow the language model with visual and audio capabilities through two-stage multi-task learning of multimodal alignment and instruction tuning. VITA demonstrates robust foundational capabilities of multilingual, vision, and audio understanding, as evidenced by its strong performance across a range of both unimodal and multimodal benchmarks. Beyond foundational capabilities, we have made considerable progress in enhancing the natural multimodal human-computer interaction experience. VITA is the first step for the open-source community to explore the seamless integration of multimodal understanding and interaction. While there is still lots of work to be done on VITA to get close to close-source counterparts, we hope that its role as a pioneer can serve as a cornerstone for subsequent research.

      <title>PhishLang: A Lightweight, Client-Side Phishing Detection Framework using MobileBERT for Real-Time, Explainable Threat Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PhishLang, an open-source, lightweight language model specifically designed for phishing website detection through contextual analysis of the website. Unlike traditional heuristic or machine learning models that rely on static features and struggle to adapt to new threats, and deep learning models that are computationally intensive, our model leverages MobileBERT, a fast and memory-efficient variant of the BERT architecture, to learn granular features characteristic of phishing attacks. PhishLang operates with minimal data preprocessing and offers performance comparable to leading deep learning anti-phishing tools, while being significantly faster and less resource-intensive. Over a 3.5-month testing period, PhishLang successfully identified 25,796 phishing URLs, many of which were undetected by popular antiphishing blocklists, thus demonstrating its potential to enhance current detection measures. Capitalizing on PhishLang's resource efficiency, we release the first open-source fully client-side Chromium browser extension that provides inference locally without requiring to consult an online blocklist and can be run on low-end systems with no impact on inference times. Our implementation not only outperforms prevalent (server-side) phishing tools, but is significantly more effective than the limited commercial client-side measures available. Furthermore, we study how PhishLang can be integrated with GPT-3.5 Turbo to create explainable blocklisting -- which, upon detection of a website, provides users with detailed contextual information about the features that led to a website being marked as phishing.</description>

      <title>Dreaming is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classification tasks, achieving a harmonious balance between exploration and precision is of paramount importance. To this end, this research introduces two novel deep learning models, SleepNet and DreamNet, to strike this balance. SleepNet seamlessly integrates supervised learning with unsupervised ``sleep" stages using pre-trained encoder models. Dedicated neurons within SleepNet are embedded in these unsupervised features, forming intermittent ``sleep" blocks that facilitate exploratory learning. Building upon the foundation of SleepNet, DreamNet employs full encoder-decoder frameworks to reconstruct the hidden states, mimicking the human "dreaming" process. This reconstruction process enables further exploration and refinement of the learned representations. Moreover, the principle ideas of our SleepNet and DreamNet are generic and can be applied to both computer vision and natural language processing downstream tasks. Through extensive empirical evaluations on diverse image and text datasets, SleepNet and DreanNet have demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models, showcasing the strengths of unsupervised exploration and supervised precision afforded by our innovative approaches.</description>

      <title>Dialogue You Can Trust: Human and AI Perspectives on Generated Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As dialogue systems and chatbots increasingly integrate into everyday interactions, the need for efficient and accurate evaluation methods becomes paramount. This study explores the comparative performance of human and AI assessments across a range of dialogue scenarios, focusing on seven key performance indicators (KPIs): Coherence, Innovation, Concreteness, Goal Contribution, Commonsense Contradiction, Incorrect Fact, and Redundancy. Utilizing the GPT-4o API, we generated a diverse dataset of conversations and conducted a two-part experimental analysis. In Experiment 1, we evaluated multi-party conversations on Coherence, Innovation, Concreteness, and Goal Contribution, revealing that GPT models align closely with human judgments. Notably, both human and AI evaluators exhibited a tendency towards binary judgment rather than linear scaling, highlighting a shared challenge in these assessments. Experiment 2 extended the work of Finch et al. (2023) by focusing on dyadic dialogues and assessing Commonsense Contradiction, Incorrect Fact, and Redundancy. The results indicate that while GPT-4o demonstrates strong performance in maintaining factual accuracy and commonsense reasoning, it still struggles with reducing redundancy and self-contradiction. Our findings underscore the potential of GPT models to closely replicate human evaluation in dialogue systems, while also pointing to areas for improvement. This research offers valuable insights for advancing the development and implementation of more refined dialogue evaluation methodologies, contributing to the evolution of more effective and human-like AI communication tools.</description>

      <title>GET-UP: GEomeTric-aware Depth Estimation with Radar Points UPsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Depth estimation plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle's 3D surroundings. Radar, with its robustness to adverse weather conditions and capability to measure distances, has drawn significant interest for radar-camera depth estimation. However, existing algorithms process the inherently noisy and sparse radar data by projecting 3D points onto the image plane for pixel-level feature extraction, overlooking the valuable geometric information contained within the radar point cloud. To address this gap, we propose GET-UP, leveraging attention-enhanced Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to exchange and aggregate both 2D and 3D information from radar data. This approach effectively enriches the feature representation by incorporating spatial relationships compared to traditional methods that rely only on 2D feature extraction. Furthermore, we incorporate a point cloud upsampling task to densify the radar point cloud, rectify point positions, and derive additional 3D features under the guidance of lidar data. Finally, we fuse radar and camera features during the decoding phase for depth estimation. We benchmark our proposed GET-UP on the nuScenes dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a 15.3% and 14.7% improvement in MAE and RMSE over the previously best-performing model.

      <title>How Much Data is Enough Data? Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for In-House Translation: Performance Evaluation Across Multiple Dataset Sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoder-only LLMs have shown impressive performance in MT due to their ability to learn from extensive datasets and generate high-quality translations. However, LLMs often struggle with the nuances and style required for organisation-specific translation. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly Llama 3 8B Instruct, leveraging translation memories (TMs), as a valuable resource to enhance accuracy and efficiency. We investigate the impact of fine-tuning the Llama 3 model using TMs from a specific organisation in the software sector. Our experiments cover five translation directions across languages of varying resource levels (English to Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, German, Finnish, and Korean). We analyse diverse sizes of training datasets (1k to 207k segments) to evaluate their influence on translation quality. We fine-tune separate models for each training set and evaluate their performance based on automatic metrics, BLEU, chrF++, TER, and COMET. Our findings reveal improvement in translation performance with larger datasets across all metrics. On average, BLEU and COMET scores increase by 13 and 25 points, respectively, on the largest training set against the baseline model. Notably, there is a performance deterioration in comparison with the baseline model when fine-tuning on only 1k and 2k examples; however, we observe a substantial improvement as the training dataset size increases. The study highlights the potential of integrating TMs with LLMs to create bespoke translation models tailored to the specific needs of businesses, thus enhancing translation quality and reducing turn-around times. This approach offers a valuable insight for organisations seeking to leverage TMs and LLMs for optimal translation outcomes, especially in narrower domains.</description>

      <title>Hermes: Memory-Efficient Pipeline Inference for Large Models on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of Transformer-based large models has achieved numerous success in recent years. However, the exponential growth in the parameters of large models introduces formidable memory challenge for edge deployment. Prior works to address this challenge mainly focus on optimizing the model structure and adopting memory swapping methods. However, the former reduces the inference accuracy, and the latter raises the inference latency. This paper introduces PIPELOAD, a novel memory-efficient pipeline execution mechanism. It reduces memory usage by incorporating dynamic memory management and minimizes inference latency by employing parallel model loading. Based on PIPELOAD mechanism, we present Hermes, a framework optimized for large model inference on edge devices. We evaluate Hermes on Transformer-based models of different sizes. Our experiments illustrate that Hermes achieves up to 4.24 X increase in inference speed and 86.7% lower memory consumption than the state-of-the-art pipeline mechanism for BERT and ViT models, 2.58 X increase in inference speed and 90.3% lower memory consumption for GPT-style models.</description>

      <title>Question-Answering Dense Video Events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown excellent performance in question-answering of single-event videos. In this paper, we present question-answering dense video events, a novel task that requires answering and grounding the dense-event questions in long videos, thus challenging MLLMs to faithfully comprehend and reason about multiple events occurring over extended time periods. To facilitate the study, we construct DeVE-QA - a dataset featuring 78K questions about 26K events on 10.6K long videos. We then benchmark and show that existing MLLMs excelling at single-event QA struggle to perform well in DeVE-QA. For improvement, we propose DeVi, a novel training-free MLLM approach that highlights a hierarchical captioning module, a temporal event memory module, and a self-consistency checking module to respectively detect, contextualize and memorize, and ground dense-events in long videos for question answering. Extensive experiments show that DeVi is superior at answering dense-event questions and grounding relevant video moments. Compared with existing MLLMs, it achieves a remarkable increase of 4.1 percent and 3.7 percent for G(round)QA accuracy on DeVE-QA and NExT-GQA respectively.</description>

Abstract: Planning methods struggle with computational intractability in solving task-level problems in large-scale environments. This work explores leveraging the commonsense knowledge encoded in LLMs to empower planning techniques to deal with these complex scenarios. We achieve this by efficiently using LLMs to prune irrelevant components from the planning problem's state space, substantially simplifying its complexity. We demonstrate the efficacy of this system through extensive experiments within a household simulation environment, alongside real-world validation using a 7-DoF manipulator (video https://youtu.be/6ro2UOtOQS4).</description>

Abstract: Influence Functions are a standard tool for attributing predictions to training data in a principled manner and are widely used in applications such as data valuation and fairness. In this work, we present realistic incentives to manipulate influencebased attributions and investigate whether these attributions can be systematically tampered by an adversary. We show that this is indeed possible and provide efficient attacks with backward-friendly implementations. Our work raises questions on the reliability of influence-based attributions under adversarial circumstances.</description>

      <title>Towards Building a Robust Knowledge Intensive Question Answering Model with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of LLMs has greatly enhanced the intelligence and fluency of question answering, while the emergence of retrieval enhancement has enabled models to better utilize external information. However, the presence of noise and errors in retrieved information poses challenges to the robustness of LLMs. In this work, to evaluate the model's performance under multiple interferences, we first construct a dataset based on machine reading comprehension datasets simulating various scenarios, including critical information absence, noise, and conflicts. To address the issue of model accuracy decline caused by noisy external information, we propose a data augmentation-based fine-tuning method to enhance LLM's robustness against noise. Additionally, contrastive learning approach is utilized to preserve the model's discrimination capability of external information. We have conducted experiments on both existing LLMs and our approach, the results are evaluated by GPT-4, which indicates that our proposed methods improve model robustness while strengthening the model's discrimination capability.</description>

      <title>CRADLE-VAE: Enhancing Single-Cell Gene Perturbation Modeling with Counterfactual Reasoning-based Artifact Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to various perturbations is a critical focus in drug discovery and personalized therapeutics, with deep learning models playing a significant role in this endeavor. Single-cell datasets contain technical artifacts that may hinder the predictability of such models, which poses quality control issues highly regarded in this area. To address this, we propose CRADLE-VAE, a causal generative framework tailored for single-cell gene perturbation modeling, enhanced with counterfactual reasoning-based artifact disentanglement. Throughout training, CRADLE-VAE models the underlying latent distribution of technical artifacts and perturbation effects present in single-cell datasets. It employs counterfactual reasoning to effectively disentangle such artifacts by modulating the latent basal spaces and learns robust features for generating cellular response data with improved quality. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach improves not only treatment effect estimation performance but also generative quality as well. The CRADLE-VAE codebase is publicly available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/CRADLE-VAE.</description>

      <title>MemoRAG: Moving towards Next-Gen RAG Via Memory-Inspired Knowledge Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages retrieval tools to access external databases, thereby enhancing the generation quality of large language models (LLMs) through optimized context. However, the existing retrieval methods are constrained inherently, as they can only perform relevance matching between explicitly stated queries and well-formed knowledge, but unable to handle tasks involving ambiguous information needs or unstructured knowledge. Consequently, existing RAG systems are primarily effective for straightforward question-answering tasks. In this work, we propose MemoRAG, a novel retrieval-augmented generation paradigm empowered by long-term memory. MemoRAG adopts a dual-system architecture. On the one hand, it employs a light but long-range LLM to form the global memory of database. Once a task is presented, it generates draft answers, cluing the retrieval tools to locate useful information within the database. On the other hand, it leverages an expensive but expressive LLM, which generates the ultimate answer based on the retrieved information. Building on this general framework, we further optimize MemoRAG's performance by enhancing its cluing mechanism and memorization capacity. In our experiment, MemoRAG achieves superior performance across a variety of evaluation tasks, including both complex ones where conventional RAG fails and straightforward ones where RAG is commonly applied.</description>

Abstract: Explanations for autonomous vehicle (AV) decisions may build trust, however, explanations can contain errors. In a simulated driving study (n = 232), we tested how AV explanation errors, driving context characteristics (perceived harm and driving difficulty), and personal traits (prior trust and expertise) affected a passenger's comfort in relying on an AV, preference for control, confidence in the AV's ability, and explanation satisfaction. Errors negatively affected all outcomes. Surprisingly, despite identical driving, explanation errors reduced ratings of the AV's driving ability. Severity and potential harm amplified the negative impact of errors. Contextual harm and driving difficulty directly impacted outcome ratings and influenced the relationship between errors and outcomes. Prior trust and expertise were positively associated with outcome ratings. Results emphasize the need for accurate, contextually adaptive, and personalized AV explanations to foster trust, reliance, satisfaction, and confidence. We conclude with design, research, and deployment recommendations for trustworthy AV explanation systems.</description>

Abstract: Large-scale scientific simulations generate massive datasets that pose significant challenges for storage and I/O. While traditional lossy compression techniques can improve performance, balancing compression ratio, data quality, and throughput remains difficult. To address this, we propose NeurLZ, a novel cross-field learning-based and error-controlled compression framework for scientific data. By integrating skipping DNN models, cross-field learning, and error control, our framework aims to substantially enhance lossy compression performance. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We design a lightweight skipping model to provide high-fidelity detail retention, further improving prediction accuracy. (2) We adopt a cross-field learning approach to significantly improve data prediction accuracy, resulting in a substantially improved compression ratio. (3) We develop an error control approach to provide strict error bounds according to user requirements. We evaluated NeurLZ on several real-world HPC application datasets, including Nyx (cosmological simulation), Miranda (large turbulence simulation), and Hurricane (weather simulation). Experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves up to a 90% relative reduction in bit rate under the same data distortion, compared to the best existing approach.</description>
