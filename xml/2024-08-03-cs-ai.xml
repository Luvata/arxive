      <title>Deceptive AI systems that give explanations are more convincing than honest AI systems and can amplify belief in misinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, specifically large language models (LLMs), have the capability to generate not just misinformation, but also deceptive explanations that can justify and propagate false information and erode trust in the truth. We examined the impact of deceptive AI generated explanations on individuals' beliefs in a pre-registered online experiment with 23,840 observations from 1,192 participants. We found that in addition to being more persuasive than accurate and honest explanations, AI-generated deceptive explanations can significantly amplify belief in false news headlines and undermine true ones as compared to AI systems that simply classify the headline incorrectly as being true/false. Moreover, our results show that personal factors such as cognitive reflection and trust in AI do not necessarily protect individuals from these effects caused by deceptive AI generated explanations. Instead, our results show that the logical validity of AI generated deceptive explanations, that is whether the explanation has a causal effect on the truthfulness of the AI's classification, plays a critical role in countering their persuasiveness - with logically invalid explanations being deemed less credible. This underscores the importance of teaching logical reasoning and critical thinking skills to identify logically invalid arguments, fostering greater resilience against advanced AI-driven misinformation.</description>

      <title>Need of AI in Modern Education: in the Eyes of Explainable AI (xAI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Education is not \textit{Modern} without AI. However, AI's complex nature makes understanding and fixing problems challenging. Research worldwide shows that a parent's income greatly influences a child's education. This led us to explore how AI, especially complex models, makes important decisions using Explainable AI tools. Our research uncovered many complexities linked to parental income and offered reasonable explanations for these decisions. However, we also found biases in AI that go against what we want from AI in education: clear transparency and equal access for everyone. These biases can impact families and children's schooling, highlighting the need for better AI solutions that offer fair opportunities to all. This chapter tries to shed light on the complex ways AI operates, especially concerning biases. These are the foundational steps towards better educational policies, which include using AI in ways that are more reliable, accountable, and beneficial for everyone involved.</description>

      <title>A New Type of Foundation Model Based on Recordings of People's Emotions and Physiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models have had a big impact in recent years and billions of dollars are being invested in them in the current AI boom. The more popular ones, such as Chat-GPT, are trained on large amounts of data from the Internet, and then reinforcement learning, RAG, prompt engineering and cognitive modelling are used to fine-tune and augment their behavior. This technology has been used to create models of individual people, such as Caryn Marjorie. However, these chatbots are not based on people's actual emotional and physiological responses to their environment, so they are, at best, surface-level approximations to the characters they are imitating. This paper describes how a new type of foundation model - a first-person foundation model - could be created from recordings of what a person sees and hears as well as their emotional and physiological reactions to these stimuli. A first-person foundation model would map environmental stimuli to a person's emotional and physiological states, and map a person's emotional and physiological states to their behavior. First-person foundation models have many exciting applications, including a new type of recommendation engine, personal assistants, generative adversarial networks, dating and recruitment. To obtain training data for a first-person foundation model, we have developed a recording rig that captures what the wearer is seeing and hearing as well as their emotional and physiological states. This novel source of data could help to address the shortage of new data for building the next generation of foundation models.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Fault Detection and Cause Identification Using Integrated Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel methodology for fault detection and cause identification within the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) by integrating a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network with an Integrated Attention Mechanism (IAM). The IAM combines the strengths of scaled dot product attention, residual attention, and dynamic attention to capture intricate patterns and dependencies crucial for TEP fault detection. Initially, the attention mechanism extracts important features from the input data, enhancing the model's interpretability and relevance. The BiLSTM network processes these features bidirectionally to capture long-range dependencies, and the IAM further refines the output, leading to improved fault detection results. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, showcasing superior performance in accuracy, false alarm rate, and misclassification rate compared to existing methods. This methodology provides a robust and interpretable solution for fault detection and diagnosis in the TEP, highlighting its potential for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Con4m: Context-aware Consistency Learning Framework for Segmented Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time Series Classification (TSC) encompasses two settings: classifying entire sequences or classifying segmented subsequences. The raw time series for segmented TSC usually contain Multiple classes with Varying Duration of each class (MVD). Therefore, the characteristics of MVD pose unique challenges for segmented TSC, yet have been largely overlooked by existing works. Specifically, there exists a natural temporal dependency between consecutive instances (segments) to be classified within MVD. However, mainstream TSC models rely on the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), focusing on independently modeling each segment. Additionally, annotators with varying expertise may provide inconsistent boundary labels, leading to unstable performance of noise-free TSC models. To address these challenges, we first formally demonstrate that valuable contextual information enhances the discriminative power of classification instances. Leveraging the contextual priors of MVD at both the data and label levels, we propose a novel consistency learning framework Con4m, which effectively utilizes contextual information more conducive to discriminating consecutive segments in segmented TSC tasks, while harmonizing inconsistent boundary labels for training. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of Con4m in handling segmented TSC tasks on MVD.</description>

      <title>Areas of Improvement for Autonomous Vehicles: A Machine Learning Analysis of Disengagement Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since 2014, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (CDMV) has compiled information from manufacturers of autonomous vehicles (AVs) regarding factors that lead to the disengagement from autonomous driving mode in these vehicles. These disengagement reports (DRs) contain information detailing whether the AV disengaged from autonomous mode due to technology failure, manual override, or other factors during driving tests. This paper presents a machine learning (ML) based analysis of the information from the 2023 DRs. We use a natural language processing (NLP) approach to extract important information from the description of a disengagement, and use the k-Means clustering algorithm to group report entries together. The cluster frequency is then analyzed, and each cluster is manually categorized based on the factors leading to disengagement. We discuss findings from previous years' DRs, and provide our own analysis to identify areas of improvement for AVs.</description>

      <title>Preference-Based Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning (with-Appendix)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of enhancing the efficacy and flexibility of interpretable, data-driven classification models, this work introduces a novel incorporation of user-defined preferences with Abstract Argumentation and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). Specifically, we introduce Preference-Based Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning (which we call AA-CBR-P), allowing users to define multiple approaches to compare cases with an ordering that specifies their preference over these comparison approaches. We prove that the model inherently follows these preferences when making predictions and show that previous abstract argumentation for case-based reasoning approaches are insufficient at expressing preferences over constituents of an argument. We then demonstrate how this can be applied to a real-world medical dataset sourced from a clinical trial evaluating differing assessment methods of patients with a primary brain tumour. We show empirically that our approach outperforms other interpretable machine learning models on this dataset.</description>

      <title>Inductive or Deductive? Rethinking the Fundamental Reasoning Abilities of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning encompasses two typical types: deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning. Despite extensive research into the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), most studies have failed to rigorously differentiate between inductive and deductive reasoning, leading to a blending of the two. This raises an essential question: In LLM reasoning, which poses a greater challenge - deductive or inductive reasoning? While the deductive reasoning capabilities of LLMs, (i.e. their capacity to follow instructions in reasoning tasks), have received considerable attention, their abilities in true inductive reasoning remain largely unexplored. To delve into the true inductive reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose a novel framework, SolverLearner. This framework enables LLMs to learn the underlying function (i.e., $y = f_w(x)$), that maps input data points $(x)$ to their corresponding output values $(y)$, using only in-context examples. By focusing on inductive reasoning and separating it from LLM-based deductive reasoning, we can isolate and investigate inductive reasoning of LLMs in its pure form via SolverLearner. Our observations reveal that LLMs demonstrate remarkable inductive reasoning capabilities through SolverLearner, achieving near-perfect performance with ACC of 1 in most cases. Surprisingly, despite their strong inductive reasoning abilities, LLMs tend to relatively lack deductive reasoning capabilities, particularly in tasks involving ``counterfactual'' reasoning.</description>

      <title>Formal Ethical Obligations in Reinforcement Learning Agents: Verification and Policy Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When designing agents for operation in uncertain environments, designers need tools to automatically reason about what agents ought to do, how that conflicts with what is actually happening, and how a policy might be modified to remove the conflict. These obligations include ethical and social obligations, permissions and prohibitions, which constrain how the agent achieves its mission and executes its policy. We propose a new deontic logic, Expected Act Utilitarian deontic logic, for enabling this reasoning at design time: for specifying and verifying the agent's strategic obligations, then modifying its policy from a reference policy to meet those obligations. Unlike approaches that work at the reward level, working at the logical level increases the transparency of the trade-offs. We introduce two algorithms: one for model-checking whether an RL agent has the right strategic obligations, and one for modifying a reference decision policy to make it meet obligations expressed in our logic. We illustrate our algorithms on DAC-MDPs which accurately abstract neural decision policies, and on toy gridworld environments.</description>

      <title>Finch: Prompt-guided Key-Value Cache Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent large language model applications, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation and chatbots, have led to an increased need to process longer input contexts. However, this requirement is hampered by inherent limitations. Architecturally, models are constrained by a context window defined during training. Additionally, processing extensive texts requires substantial GPU memory. We propose a novel approach, Finch, to compress the input context by leveraging the pre-trained model weights of the self-attention. Given a prompt and a long text, Finch iteratively identifies the most relevant Key (K) and Value (V) pairs over chunks of the text conditioned on the prompt. Only such pairs are stored in the KV cache, which, within the space constrained by the context window, ultimately contains a compressed version of the long text. Our proposal enables models to consume large inputs even with high compression (up to 93x) while preserving semantic integrity without the need for fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Lost in Translation: Latent Concept Misalignment in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have broadened extensive downstream practical applications, but such models often encounter misalignment issues between text and image. Taking the generation of a combination of two disentangled concepts as an example, say given the prompt "a tea cup of iced coke", existing models usually generate a glass cup of iced coke because the iced coke usually co-occurs with the glass cup instead of the tea one during model training. The root of such misalignment is attributed to the confusion in the latent semantic space of text-to-image diffusion models, and hence we refer to the "a tea cup of iced coke" phenomenon as Latent Concept Misalignment (LC-Mis). We leverage large language models (LLMs) to thoroughly investigate the scope of LC-Mis, and develop an automated pipeline for aligning the latent semantics of diffusion models to text prompts. Empirical assessments confirm the effectiveness of our approach, substantially reducing LC-Mis errors and enhancing the robustness and versatility of text-to-image diffusion models. Our code and dataset have been available online for reference.</description>

      <title>Multiple Greedy Quasi-Newton Methods for Saddle Point Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Multiple Greedy Quasi-Newton (MGSR1-SP) method, a novel approach to solving strongly-convex-strongly-concave (SCSC) saddle point problems. Our method enhances the approximation of the squared indefinite Hessian matrix inherent in these problems, significantly improving both stability and efficiency through iterative greedy updates. We provide a thorough theoretical analysis of MGSR1-SP, demonstrating its linear-quadratic convergence rate. Numerical experiments conducted on AUC maximization and adversarial debiasing problems, compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, underscore our method's enhanced convergence rate. These results affirm the potential of MGSR1-SP to improve performance across a broad spectrum of machine learning applications where efficient and accurate Hessian approximations are crucial.</description>

      <title>RoCo:Robust Collaborative Perception By Iterative Object Matching and Pose Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative autonomous driving with multiple vehicles usually requires the data fusion from multiple modalities. To ensure effective fusion, the data from each individual modality shall maintain a reasonably high quality. However, in collaborative perception, the quality of object detection based on a modality is highly sensitive to the relative pose errors among the agents. It leads to feature misalignment and significantly reduces collaborative performance. To address this issue, we propose RoCo, a novel unsupervised framework to conduct iterative object matching and agent pose adjustment. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to model the pose correction problem in collaborative perception as an object matching task, which reliably associates common objects detected by different agents. On top of this, we propose a graph optimization process to adjust the agent poses by minimizing the alignment errors of the associated objects, and the object matching is re-done based on the adjusted agent poses. This process is carried out iteratively until convergence. Experimental study on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework RoCo consistently outperforms existing relevant methods in terms of the collaborative object detection performance, and exhibits highly desired robustness when the pose information of agents is with high-level noise. Ablation studies are also provided to show the impact of its key parameters and components. The code is released at https://github.com/HuangZhe885/RoCo.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable GPU-Accelerated SNN Training via Temporal Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing on the intricate structures of the brain, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) emerge as a transformative development in artificial intelligence, closely emulating the complex dynamics of biological neural networks. While SNNs show promising efficiency on specialized sparse-computational hardware, their practical training often relies on conventional GPUs. This reliance frequently leads to extended computation times when contrasted with traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), presenting significant hurdles for advancing SNN research. To navigate this challenge, we present a novel temporal fusion method, specifically designed to expedite the propagation dynamics of SNNs on GPU platforms, which serves as an enhancement to the current significant approaches for handling deep learning tasks with SNNs. This method underwent thorough validation through extensive experiments in both authentic training scenarios and idealized conditions, confirming its efficacy and adaptability for single and multi-GPU systems. Benchmarked against various existing SNN libraries/implementations, our method achieved accelerations ranging from $5\times$ to $40\times$ on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Publicly available experimental codes can be found at https://github.com/EMI-Group/snn-temporal-fusion.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Fusion and Coherence Modeling for Video Topic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The video topic segmentation (VTS) task segments videos into intelligible, non-overlapping topics, facilitating efficient comprehension of video content and quick access to specific content. VTS is also critical to various downstream video understanding tasks. Traditional VTS methods using shallow features or unsupervised approaches struggle to accurately discern the nuances of topical transitions. Recently, supervised approaches have achieved superior performance on video action or scene segmentation over unsupervised approaches. In this work, we improve supervised VTS by thoroughly exploring multimodal fusion and multimodal coherence modeling. Specifically, (1) we enhance multimodal fusion by exploring different architectures using cross-attention and mixture of experts. (2) To generally strengthen multimodality alignment and fusion, we pre-train and fine-tune the model with multimodal contrastive learning. (3) We propose a new pre-training task tailored for the VTS task, and a novel fine-tuning task for enhancing multimodal coherence modeling for VTS. We evaluate the proposed approaches on educational videos, in the form of lectures, due to the vital role of topic segmentation of educational videos in boosting learning experiences. Additionally, we introduce a large-scale Chinese lecture video dataset to augment the existing English corpus, promoting further research in VTS. Experiments on both English and Chinese lecture datasets demonstrate that our model achieves superior VTS performance compared to competitive unsupervised and supervised baselines.</description>

      <title>Conformal Trajectory Prediction with Multi-View Data Integration in Cooperative Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current research on trajectory prediction primarily relies on data collected by onboard sensors of an ego vehicle. With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions. We evaluated the entire framework using the real-world V2I dataset V2X-Seq. Our results demonstrate superior performance in terms of Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Miss Rate (MR) using a single GPU. The code is publicly available at: \url{https://github.com/xichennn/V2I_trajectory_prediction}.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Pairwise Causal Discovery on Heterogeneous Data using Mutual Information Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental task in science is to determine the underlying causal relations because it is the knowledge of this functional structure what leads to the correct interpretation of an effect given the apparent associations in the observed data. In this sense, Causal Discovery is a technique that tackles this challenge by analyzing the statistical properties of the constituent variables. In this work, we target the generalizability of the discovery method by following a reductionist approach that only involves two variables, i.e., the pairwise or bi-variate setting. We question the current (possibly misleading) baseline results on the basis that they were obtained through supervised learning, which is arguably contrary to this genuinely exploratory endeavor. In consequence, we approach this problem in an unsupervised way, using robust Mutual Information measures, and observing the impact of the different variable types, which is oftentimes ignored in the design of solutions. Thus, we provide a novel set of standard unbiased results that can serve as a reference to guide future discovery tasks in completely unknown environments.</description>

      <title>Ontological Relations from Word Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been reliably shown that the similarity of word embeddings obtained from popular neural models such as BERT approximates effectively a form of semantic similarity of the meaning of those words. It is therefore natural to wonder if those embeddings contain enough information to be able to connect those meanings through ontological relationships such as the one of subsumption. If so, large knowledge models could be built that are capable of semantically relating terms based on the information encapsulated in word embeddings produced by pre-trained models, with implications not only for ontologies (ontology matching, ontology evolution, etc.) but also on the ability to integrate ontological knowledge in neural models. In this paper, we test how embeddings produced by several pre-trained models can be used to predict relations existing between classes and properties of popular upper-level and general ontologies. We show that even a simple feed-forward architecture on top of those embeddings can achieve promising accuracies, with varying generalisation abilities depending on the input data. To achieve that, we produce a dataset that can be used to further enhance those models, opening new possibilities for applications integrating knowledge from web ontologies.</description>

      <title>HBot: A Chatbot for Healthcare Applications in Traditional Chinese Medicine Based on Human Body 3D Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique diagnosis and treatment techniques and remarkable clinical efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) make it play an important role in the field of elderly care and healthcare, especially in the rehabilitation of some common chronic diseases of the elderly. Therefore, building a TCM chatbot for healthcare application will help users obtain consultation services in a direct and natural way. However, concepts such as acupuncture points (acupoints) and meridians involved in TCM always appear in the consultation, which cannot be displayed intuitively. To this end, we develop a \textbf{h}ealthcare chat\textbf{bot} (HBot) based on a human body model in 3D and knowledge graph, which provides conversational services such as knowledge Q\&amp;A, prescription recommendation, moxibustion therapy recommendation, and acupoint search. When specific acupoints are involved in the conversations between user and HBot, the 3D body will jump to the corresponding acupoints and highlight them. Moreover, Hbot can also be used in training scenarios to accelerate the teaching process of TCM by intuitively displaying acupuncture points and knowledge cards. The demonstration video is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhQhutSKkTU . Our code and dataset are publicly available at Gitee: https://gitee.com/plabrolin/interactive-3d-acup.git</description>

      <title>A new approach for encoding code and assisting code understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some companies(e.g., Microsoft Research and Google DeepMind) have discovered some of the limitations of GPTs autoregressive paradigm next-word prediction, manifested in the model lack of planning, working memory, backtracking, and reasoning skills. GPTs rely on a local and greedy process of generating the next word, without a global understanding of the task or the output.We have confirmed the above limitations through specialized empirical studies of code comprehension. Although GPT4 is good at producing fluent and coherent text, it cannot handle complex logic and generate new code that haven not been seen, and it relies too much on the formatting of the prompt to generate the correct code.We propose a new paradigm for code understanding that goes beyond the next-word prediction paradigm, inspired by the successful application of diffusion techniques to image generation(Dalle2, Sora) and protein structure generation(AlphaFold3), which have no autoregressive constraints.Instead of encoding the code in a form that mimics natural language, we encode the code as a heterogeneous image paradigm with a memory of global information that mimics both images and protein structures.We then refer to Sora's CLIP upstream text-to-image encoder model to design a text-to-code encoder model that can be applied to various downstream code understanding tasks.The model learns the global understanding of code under the new paradigm heterogeneous image, connects the encoding space of text and code, and encodes the input of text into the vector of code most similar to it.Using self-supervised comparative learning on 456,360 text-code pairs, the model achieved a zero-shot prediction of new data. This work is the basis for future work on code generation using diffusion techniques under a new paradigm to avoid autoregressive limitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has undergone a profound transformation in addressing intricate tasks involving diverse modalities such as textual, auditory, visual, and pictorial generation. Within this spectrum, text-to-image (TTI) models have emerged as a formidable approach to generating varied and aesthetically appealing compositions, spanning applications from artistic creation to realistic facial synthesis, and demonstrating significant advancements in computer vision, image processing, and multimodal tasks. The advent of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) signifies a paradigm shift in the domain of AI capabilities. This article delves into the feasibility of employing the Stable Diffusion LDM to illustrate literary works. For this exploration, seven classic Brazilian books have been selected as case studies. The objective is to ascertain the practicality of this endeavor and to evaluate the potential of Stable Diffusion in producing illustrations that augment and enrich the reader's experience. We will outline the beneficial aspects, such as the capacity to generate distinctive and contextually pertinent images, as well as the drawbacks, including any shortcomings in faithfully capturing the essence of intricate literary depictions. Through this study, we aim to provide a comprehensive assessment of the viability and efficacy of utilizing AI-generated illustrations in literary contexts, elucidating both the prospects and challenges encountered in this pioneering application of technology.</description>

      <title>SentenceVAE: Faster, Longer and More Accurate Inference with Next-sentence Prediction for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary large language models (LLMs) predominantly utilize a next-token prediction method for inference, which significantly impedes their processing speed. In this paper, we introduce a novel inference methodology termed next-sentence prediction, aimed at enhancing the inference efficiency of LLMs. We present SentenceVAE, a tiny model consisting of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder effectively condenses the information within a sentence into a singular token, while the decoder reconstructs this compressed data back into its original sentential form. By integrating SentenceVAE into the input and output layers of LLMs, we develop Sentence-level LLMs (SLLMs) that employ a sentence-by-sentence inference approach, markedly accelerating inference speeds. SentenceVAE also maintains the integrity of the original semantic content by segmenting the text into sentences, thereby preserving accuracy while boosting inference speeds. Compared to traditional LLMs, SLLMs process fewer tokens over equivalent context lengths, significantly reducing memory demands for Self-Attention computations and facilitating the handling of longer contexts. Our experimental findings reveal that this method can increase inference speeds by 204~365%, reduce perplexity (PPL) to 46~75% of its original metric, and decrease memory overhead by 86~91% for the same context length. The advantages of this approach are further amplified with increases in model parameters.</description>

      <title>Can Developers Prompt? A Controlled Experiment for Code Documentation Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) bear great potential for automating tedious development tasks such as creating and maintaining code documentation. However, it is unclear to what extent developers can effectively prompt LLMs to create concise and useful documentation. We report on a controlled experiment with 20 professionals and 30 computer science students tasked with code documentation generation for two Python functions. The experimental group freely entered ad-hoc prompts in a ChatGPT-like extension of Visual Studio Code, while the control group executed a predefined few-shot prompt. Our results reveal that professionals and students were unaware of or unable to apply prompt engineering techniques. Especially students perceived the documentation produced from ad-hoc prompts as significantly less readable, less concise, and less helpful than documentation from prepared prompts. Some professionals produced higher quality documentation by just including the keyword Docstring in their ad-hoc prompts. While students desired more support in formulating prompts, professionals appreciated the flexibility of ad-hoc prompting. Participants in both groups rarely assessed the output as perfect. Instead, they understood the tools as support to iteratively refine the documentation. Further research is needed to understand which prompting skills and preferences developers have and which support they need for certain tasks.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Analysis of Compute-Optimal Inference for Problem-Solving with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal training configurations of large language models (LLMs) with respect to model sizes and compute budgets have been extensively studied. But how to optimally configure LLMs during inference has not been explored in sufficient depth. We study compute-optimal inference: designing models and inference strategies that optimally trade off additional inference-time compute for improved performance. As a first step towards understanding and designing compute-optimal inference methods, we assessed the effectiveness and computational efficiency of multiple inference strategies such as Greedy Search, Majority Voting, Best-of-N, Weighted Voting, and their variants on two different Tree Search algorithms, involving different model sizes and computational budgets. We found that a smaller language model with a novel tree search algorithm typically achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off. These results highlight the potential benefits of deploying smaller models equipped with more sophisticated decoding algorithms in budget-constrained scenarios, e.g., on end-devices, to enhance problem-solving accuracy. For instance, we show that the Llemma-7B model can achieve competitive accuracy to a Llemma-34B model on MATH500 while using $2\times$ less FLOPs. Our findings could potentially apply to any generation task with a well-defined measure of success.</description>

      <title>DynamoLLM: Designing LLM Inference Clusters for Performance and Energy Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution and widespread adoption of generative large language models (LLMs) have made them a pivotal workload in various applications. Today, LLM inference clusters receive a large number of queries with strict Service Level Objectives (SLOs). To achieve the desired performance, these models execute on power-hungry GPUs causing the inference clusters to consume large amount of energy and, consequently, result in excessive carbon emissions. Fortunately, we find that there is a great opportunity to exploit the heterogeneity in inference compute properties and fluctuations in inference workloads, to significantly improve energy-efficiency. However, such a diverse and dynamic environment creates a large search-space where different system configurations (e.g., number of instances, model parallelism, and GPU frequency) translate into different energy-performance trade-offs. To address these challenges, we propose DynamoLLM, the first energy-management framework for LLM inference environments. DynamoLLM automatically and dynamically reconfigures the inference cluster to optimize for energy and cost of LLM serving under the service's performance SLOs. We show that at a service-level, DynamoLLM conserves 53% energy and 38% operational carbon emissions, and reduces 61% cost to the customer, while meeting the latency SLOs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual diffusion models have revolutionized the field of creative AI, producing high-quality and diverse content. However, they inevitably memorize training images or videos, subsequently replicating their concepts, content, or styles during inference. This phenomenon raises significant concerns about privacy, security, and copyright within generated outputs. In this survey, we provide the first comprehensive review of replication in visual diffusion models, marking a novel contribution to the field by systematically categorizing the existing studies into unveiling, understanding, and mitigating this phenomenon. Specifically, unveiling mainly refers to the methods used to detect replication instances. Understanding involves analyzing the underlying mechanisms and factors that contribute to this phenomenon. Mitigation focuses on developing strategies to reduce or eliminate replication. Beyond these aspects, we also review papers focusing on its real-world influence. For instance, in the context of healthcare, replication is critically worrying due to privacy concerns related to patient data. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of the ongoing challenges, such as the difficulty in detecting and benchmarking replication, and outlines future directions including the development of more robust mitigation techniques. By synthesizing insights from diverse studies, this paper aims to equip researchers and practitioners with a deeper understanding at the intersection between AI technology and social good. We release this project at https://github.com/WangWenhao0716/Awesome-Diffusion-Replication.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Transfer Learning in Deep Learning Models for Classification on a Custom Wildlife Dataset: Can YOLOv8 Surpass Other Architectures?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biodiversity plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem. However, poaching and unintentional human activities contribute to the decline in the population of many species. Hence, active monitoring is required to preserve these endangered species. Current human-led monitoring techniques are prone to errors and are labor-intensive. Therefore, we study the application of deep learning methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning, which can aid in automating the process of monitoring endangered species. For this, we create our custom dataset utilizing trustworthy online databases like iNaturalist and ZooChat. To choose the best model for our use case, we compare the performance of different architectures like DenseNet, ResNet, VGGNet, and YOLOv8 on the custom wildlife dataset. Transfer learning reduces training time by freezing the pre-trained weights and replacing only the output layer with custom, fully connected layers designed for our dataset. Our results indicate that YOLOv8 performs better, achieving a training accuracy of 97.39 % and an F1 score of 96.50 %, surpassing other models. Our findings suggest that integrating YOLOv8 into conservation efforts could revolutionize wildlife monitoring with its high accuracy and efficiency, potentially transforming how endangered species are monitored and protected worldwide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of correctly formatting numeric expressions in automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts. This is challenging since the expected transcript format depends on the context, e.g., 1945 (year) vs. 19:45 (timestamp). We compare cascaded and end-to-end approaches to recognize and format numeric expression, such as years, timestamps, currency amounts, and quantities. For the end-to-end approach we employed a data generation strategy using a large language model (LLM) together with a text to speech (TTS) model to generate adaptation data. The results on our test dataset show that while approaches based on LLMs perform well on recognizing formatted numeric expressions, adapted end-to-end models offer competitive performance with the advantage of lower latency and inference cost.</description>

      <title>Framework for Curating Speech Datasets and Evaluating ASR Systems: A Case Study for Polish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech datasets available in the public domain are often underutilized because of challenges in discoverability and interoperability. A comprehensive framework has been designed to survey, catalog, and curate available speech datasets, which allows replicable evaluation of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. A case study focused on the Polish language was conducted; the framework was applied to curate more than 24 datasets and evaluate 25 combinations of ASR systems and models. This research constitutes the most extensive comparison to date of both commercial and free ASR systems for the Polish language. It draws insights from 600 system-model-test set evaluations, marking a significant advancement in both scale and comprehensiveness. The results of surveys and performance comparisons are available as interactive dashboards (https://huggingface.co/spaces/amu-cai/pl-asr-leaderboard) along with curated datasets (https://huggingface.co/datasets/amu-cai/pl-asr-bigos-v2, https://huggingface.co/datasets/pelcra/pl-asr-pelcra-for-bigos) and the open challenge call (https://poleval.pl/tasks/task3). Tools used for evaluation are open-sourced (https://github.com/goodmike31/pl-asr-bigos-tools), facilitating replication and adaptation for other languages, as well as continuous expansion with new datasets and systems.</description>

Abstract: We introduce WebApp1K, a practical code-generation benchmark to measure LLM ability to develop web apps. This benchmark aims to calibrate LLM output and aid the models to progressively improve code correctness and functionality. The benchmark is lightweight and easy to run. We present the initial version of WebApp1K, and share our findings of running the benchmark against the latest frontier LLMs. First, open source LLMs deliver impressive performance, closely trailing behind GPT-4o and Claude 3.5. Second, model size has strong correlation with code correctness. Third, no prompting techniques have been found to lift performance either universally to all models, or significantly to a single model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target interactions is critical for advancing drug discovery. By reducing time and cost, machine learning and deep learning can accelerate this discovery process. Our approach utilises the powerful Barlow Twins architecture for feature-extraction while considering the structure of the target protein, achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance against multiple established benchmarks. The use of gradient boosting machine as the underlying predictor ensures fast and efficient predictions without the need for large computational resources. In addition, we further benchmarked new baselines against existing methods. Together, these innovations improve the efficiency and effectiveness of drug-target interaction predictions, providing robust tools for accelerating drug development and deepening the understanding of molecular interactions.</description>

      <title>From Attributes to Natural Language: A Survey and Foresight on Text-based Person Re-identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-based person re-identification (Re-ID) is a challenging topic in the field of complex multimodal analysis, its ultimate aim is to recognize specific pedestrians by scrutinizing attributes/natural language descriptions. Despite the wide range of applicable areas such as security surveillance, video retrieval, person tracking, and social media analytics, there is a notable absence of comprehensive reviews dedicated to summarizing the text-based person Re-ID from a technical perspective. To address this gap, we propose to introduce a taxonomy spanning Evaluation, Strategy, Architecture, and Optimization dimensions, providing a comprehensive survey of the text-based person Re-ID task. We start by laying the groundwork for text-based person Re-ID, elucidating fundamental concepts related to attribute/natural language-based identification. Then a thorough examination of existing benchmark datasets and metrics is presented. Subsequently, we further delve into prevalent feature extraction strategies employed in text-based person Re-ID research, followed by a concise summary of common network architectures within the domain. Prevalent loss functions utilized for model optimization and modality alignment in text-based person Re-ID are also scrutinized. To conclude, we offer a concise summary of our findings, pinpointing challenges in text-based person Re-ID. In response to these challenges, we outline potential avenues for future open-set text-based person Re-ID and present a baseline architecture for text-based pedestrian image generation-guided re-identification(TBPGR).</description>

      <title>ReLiK: Retrieve and LinK, Fast and Accurate Entity Linking and Relation Extraction on an Academic Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) and Relation Extraction (RE) are fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing, serving as critical components in a wide range of applications. In this paper, we propose ReLiK, a Retriever-Reader architecture for both EL and RE, where, given an input text, the Retriever module undertakes the identification of candidate entities or relations that could potentially appear within the text. Subsequently, the Reader module is tasked to discern the pertinent retrieved entities or relations and establish their alignment with the corresponding textual spans. Notably, we put forward an innovative input representation that incorporates the candidate entities or relations alongside the text, making it possible to link entities or extract relations in a single forward pass and to fully leverage pre-trained language models contextualization capabilities, in contrast with previous Retriever-Reader-based methods, which require a forward pass for each candidate. Our formulation of EL and RE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks while using academic budget training and with up to 40x inference speed compared to competitors. Finally, we show how our architecture can be used seamlessly for Information Extraction (cIE), i.e. EL + RE, and setting a new state of the art by employing a shared Reader that simultaneously extracts entities and relations.</description>

      <title>WAS: Dataset and Methods for Artistic Text Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate text segmentation results are crucial for text-related generative tasks, such as text image generation, text editing, text removal, and text style transfer. Recently, some scene text segmentation methods have made significant progress in segmenting regular text. However, these methods perform poorly in scenarios containing artistic text. Therefore, this paper focuses on the more challenging task of artistic text segmentation and constructs a real artistic text segmentation dataset. One challenge of the task is that the local stroke shapes of artistic text are changeable with diversity and complexity. We propose a decoder with the layer-wise momentum query to prevent the model from ignoring stroke regions of special shapes. Another challenge is the complexity of the global topological structure. We further design a skeleton-assisted head to guide the model to focus on the global structure. Additionally, to enhance the generalization performance of the text segmentation model, we propose a strategy for training data synthesis, based on the large multi-modal model and the diffusion model. Experimental results show that our proposed method and synthetic dataset can significantly enhance the performance of artistic text segmentation and achieve state-of-the-art results on other public datasets.</description>

      <title>Measuring Progress in Dictionary Learning for Language Model Interpretability with Board Game Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What latent features are encoded in language model (LM) representations? Recent work on training sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle interpretable features in LM representations has shown significant promise. However, evaluating the quality of these SAEs is difficult because we lack a ground-truth collection of interpretable features that we expect good SAEs to recover. We thus propose to measure progress in interpretable dictionary learning by working in the setting of LMs trained on chess and Othello transcripts. These settings carry natural collections of interpretable features -- for example, "there is a knight on F3" -- which we leverage into $\textit{supervised}$ metrics for SAE quality. To guide progress in interpretable dictionary learning, we introduce a new SAE training technique, $\textit{p-annealing}$, which improves performance on prior unsupervised metrics as well as our new metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Gemma 2, a new addition to the Gemma family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models, ranging in scale from 2 billion to 27 billion parameters. In this new version, we apply several known technical modifications to the Transformer architecture, such as interleaving local-global attentions (Beltagy et al., 2020a) and group-query attention (Ainslie et al., 2023). We also train the 2B and 9B models with knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) instead of next token prediction. The resulting models deliver the best performance for their size, and even offer competitive alternatives to models that are 2-3 times bigger. We release all our models to the community.</description>

      <title>Semantic Codebook Learning for Dynamic Recommendation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic sequential recommendation (DSR) can generate model parameters based on user behavior to improve the personalization of sequential recommendation under various user preferences. However, it faces the challenges of large parameter search space and sparse and noisy user-item interactions, which reduces the applicability of the generated model parameters. The Semantic Codebook Learning for Dynamic Recommendation Models (SOLID) framework presents a significant advancement in DSR by effectively tackling these challenges. By transforming item sequences into semantic sequences and employing a dual parameter model, SOLID compresses the parameter generation search space and leverages homogeneity within the recommendation system. The introduction of the semantic metacode and semantic codebook, which stores disentangled item representations, ensures robust and accurate parameter generation. Extensive experiments demonstrates that SOLID consistently outperforms existing DSR, delivering more accurate, stable, and robust recommendations.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Optimization as a Scalable Framework to Characterize Extreme Value Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to develop distributionally robust optimization (DRO) estimators, specifically for multidimensional Extreme Value Theory (EVT) statistics. EVT supports using semi-parametric models called max-stable distributions built from spatial Poisson point processes. While powerful, these models are only asymptotically valid for large samples. However, since extreme data is by definition scarce, the potential for model misspecification error is inherent to these applications, thus DRO estimators are natural. In order to mitigate over-conservative estimates while enhancing out-of-sample performance, we study DRO estimators informed by semi-parametric max-stable constraints in the space of point processes. We study both tractable convex formulations for some problems of interest (e.g. CVaR) and more general neural network based estimators. Both approaches are validated using synthetically generated data, recovering prescribed characteristics, and verifying the efficacy of the proposed techniques. Additionally, the proposed method is applied to a real data set of financial returns for comparison to a previous analysis. We established the proposed model as a novel formulation in the multivariate EVT domain, and innovative with respect to performance when compared to relevant alternate proposals.</description>

      <title>Correcting Negative Bias in Large Language Models through Negative Attention Score Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A binary decision task, like yes-no questions or answer verification, reflects a significant real-world scenario such as where users look for confirmation about the correctness of their decisions on specific issues. In this work, we observe that language models exhibit a negative bias in the binary decisions of complex reasoning tasks. Based on our observations and the rationale about attention-based model dynamics, we propose a negative attention score (NAS) to systematically and quantitatively formulate negative bias. Based on NAS, we identify attention heads that attend to negative tokens provided in the instructions as answer candidate of binary decisions, regardless of the question in the prompt, and validate their association with the negative bias. Additionally, we propose the negative attention score alignment (NASA) method, which is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to address the extracted negatively biased attention heads. Experimental results from various domains of reasoning tasks and large model search space demonstrate that NASA significantly reduces the gap between precision and recall caused by negative bias while preserving their generalization abilities.

      <title>Distributed In-Context Learning under Non-IID Among Clients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown their effectiveness in multiple complicated natural language reasoning tasks. A key challenge remains in adapting these models efficiently to new or unfamiliar tasks. In-context learning (ICL) provides a promising solution for few-shot adaptation by retrieving a set of data points relevant to a query, called in-context examples (ICE), from a training dataset and providing them during the inference as context. Most existing studies utilize a centralized training dataset, yet many real-world datasets may be distributed among multiple clients, and remote data retrieval can be associated with costs. Especially when the client data are non-identical independent distributions (non-IID), retrieving from clients a proper set of ICEs needed for a test query presents critical challenges. In this paper, we first show that in this challenging setting, test queries will have different preferences among clients because of non-IIDness, and equal contribution often leads to suboptimal performance. We then introduce a novel approach to tackle the distributed non-IID ICL problem when a data usage budget is present. The principle is that each client's proper contribution (budget) should be designed according to the preference of each query for that client. Our approach uses a data-driven manner to allocate a budget for each client, tailored to each test query. Through extensive empirical studies on diverse datasets, our framework demonstrates superior performance relative to competing baselines.</description>

      <title>StyleRF-VolVis: Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Fields for Expressive Volume Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In volume visualization, visualization synthesis has attracted much attention due to its ability to generate novel visualizations without following the conventional rendering pipeline. However, existing solutions based on generative adversarial networks often require many training images and take significant training time. Still, issues such as low quality, consistency, and flexibility persist. This paper introduces StyleRF-VolVis, an innovative style transfer framework for expressive volume visualization (VolVis) via neural radiance field (NeRF). The expressiveness of StyleRF-VolVis is upheld by its ability to accurately separate the underlying scene geometry (i.e., content) and color appearance (i.e., style), conveniently modify color, opacity, and lighting of the original rendering while maintaining visual content consistency across the views, and effectively transfer arbitrary styles from reference images to the reconstructed 3D scene. To achieve these, we design a base NeRF model for scene geometry extraction, a palette color network to classify regions of the radiance field for photorealistic editing, and an unrestricted color network to lift the color palette constraint via knowledge distillation for non-photorealistic editing. We demonstrate the superior quality, consistency, and flexibility of StyleRF-VolVis by experimenting with various volume rendering scenes and reference images and comparing StyleRF-VolVis against other image-based (AdaIN), video-based (ReReVST), and NeRF-based (ARF and SNeRF) style rendering solutions.</description>

Abstract: This research investigates the impact of social robot participation in group conversations and assesses the effectiveness of various addressing policies. The study involved 300 participants, divided into groups of four, interacting with a humanoid robot serving as the moderator. The robot utilized conversation data to determine the most appropriate speaker to address. The findings indicate that the robot's addressing policy significantly influenced conversation dynamics, resulting in more balanced attention to each participant and a reduction in subgroup formation.</description>

      <title>Automatic Generation of Behavioral Test Cases For Natural Language Processing Using Clustering and Prompting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work in behavioral testing for natural language processing (NLP) models, such as Checklist, is inspired by related paradigms in software engineering testing. They allow evaluation of general linguistic capabilities and domain understanding, hence can help evaluate conceptual soundness and identify model weaknesses. However, a major challenge is the creation of test cases. The current packages rely on semi-automated approach using manual development which requires domain expertise and can be time consuming. This paper introduces an automated approach to develop test cases by exploiting the power of large language models and statistical techniques. It clusters the text representations to carefully construct meaningful groups and then apply prompting techniques to automatically generate Minimal Functionality Tests (MFT). The well-known Amazon Reviews corpus is used to demonstrate our approach. We analyze the behavioral test profiles across four different classification algorithms and discuss the limitations and strengths of those models.</description>

      <title>A Taxonomy of Stereotype Content in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a taxonomy of stereotype content in contemporary large language models (LLMs). We prompt ChatGPT 3.5, Llama 3, and Mixtral 8x7B, three powerful and widely used LLMs, for the characteristics associated with 87 social categories (e.g., gender, race, occupations). We identify 14 stereotype dimensions (e.g., Morality, Ability, Health, Beliefs, Emotions), accounting for ~90% of LLM stereotype associations. Warmth and Competence facets were the most frequent content, but all other dimensions were significantly prevalent. Stereotypes were more positive in LLMs (vs. humans), but there was significant variability across categories and dimensions. Finally, the taxonomy predicted the LLMs' internal evaluations of social categories (e.g., how positively/negatively the categories were represented), supporting the relevance of a multidimensional taxonomy for characterizing LLM stereotypes. Our findings suggest that high-dimensional human stereotypes are reflected in LLMs and must be considered in AI auditing and debiasing to minimize unidentified harms from reliance in low-dimensional views of bias in LLMs.</description>

Abstract: Rethink convolution-based graph neural networks (GNN) -- they characteristically suffer from limited expressiveness, over-smoothing, and over-squashing, and require specialized sparse kernels for efficient computation. Here, we design a simple graph learning module entirely free of convolution operators, coined \textit{random walk with unifying memory} (RUM) neural network, where an RNN merges the topological and semantic graph features along the random walks terminating at each node. Relating the rich literature on RNN behavior and graph topology, we theoretically show and experimentally verify that RUM attenuates the aforementioned symptoms and is more expressive than the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) isomorphism test. On a variety of node- and graph-level classification and regression tasks, RUM not only achieves competitive performance, but is also robust, memory-efficient, scalable, and faster than the simplest convolutional GNNs.</description>

Abstract: Explainability of recommender systems has become essential to ensure users' trust and satisfaction. Various types of explainable recommender systems have been proposed including explainable graph-based recommender systems. This review paper discusses state-of-the-art approaches of these systems and categorizes them based on three aspects: learning methods, explaining methods, and explanation types. It also explores the commonly used datasets, explainability evaluation methods, and future directions of this research area. Compared with the existing review papers, this paper focuses on explainability based on graphs and covers the topics required for developing novel explainable graph-based recommender systems.</description>

      <title>CREW: Facilitating Human-AI Teaming Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the potential of humans working with AI agents has been growing at a great speed. Human-AI teaming is an important paradigm for studying various aspects when humans and AI agents work together. The unique aspect of Human-AI teaming research is the need to jointly study humans and AI agents, demanding multidisciplinary research efforts from machine learning to human-computer interaction, robotics, cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, social science, and complex systems. However, existing platforms for Human-AI teaming research are limited, often supporting oversimplified scenarios and a single task, or specifically focusing on either human-teaming research or multi-agent AI algorithms. We introduce CREW, a platform to facilitate Human-AI teaming research and engage collaborations from multiple scientific disciplines, with a strong emphasis on human involvement. It includes pre-built tasks for cognitive studies and Human-AI teaming with expandable potentials from our modular design. Following conventional cognitive neuroscience research, CREW also supports multimodal human physiological signal recording for behavior analysis. Moreover, CREW benchmarks real-time human-guided reinforcement learning agents using state-of-the-art algorithms and well-tuned baselines. With CREW, we were able to conduct 50 human subject studies within a week to verify the effectiveness of our benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in medical imaging requires access to large-scale and diverse datasets for training and evaluation. In dermatology, obtaining such datasets remains challenging due to significant variations in patient populations, illumination conditions, and acquisition system characteristics. In this work, we propose S-SYNTH, the first knowledge-based, adaptable open-source skin simulation framework to rapidly generate synthetic skin, 3D models and digitally rendered images, using an anatomically inspired multi-layer, multi-component skin and growing lesion model. The skin model allows for controlled variation in skin appearance, such as skin color, presence of hair, lesion shape, and blood fraction among other parameters. We use this framework to study the effect of possible variations on the development and evaluation of AI models for skin lesion segmentation, and show that results obtained using synthetic data follow similar comparative trends as real dermatologic images, while mitigating biases and limitations from existing datasets including small dataset size, lack of diversity, and underrepresentation.</description>

Abstract: In order to deploy deep neural networks (DNNs) in high-stakes scenarios, it is imperative that DNNs provide inference robust to external perturbations - both intentional and unintentional.Although the resilience of DNNs to intentional and unintentional perturbations has been widely investigated, a unified vision of these inherently intertwined problem domains is still missing.In this work, we fill this gap by providing a survey of the state of the art and highlighting the similarities of the proposed approaches.We also analyze the research challenges that need to be addressed to deploy resilient and secure DNNs.As there has not been any such survey connecting the resilience of DNNs to intentional and unintentional perturbations, we believe this work can help advance the frontier in both domains by enabling the exchange of ideas between the two communities.</description>

      <title>Automated Software Vulnerability Static Code Analysis Using Generative Pre-Trained Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Pre-Trained Transformer models have been shown to be surprisingly effective at a variety of natural language processing tasks -- including generating computer code. We evaluate the effectiveness of open source GPT models for the task of automatic identification of the presence of vulnerable code syntax (specifically targeting C and C++ source code). This task is evaluated on a selection of 36 source code examples from the NIST SARD dataset, which are specifically curated to not contain natural English that indicates the presence, or lack thereof, of a particular vulnerability. The NIST SARD source code dataset contains identified vulnerable lines of source code that are examples of one out of the 839 distinct Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE), allowing for exact quantification of the GPT output classification error rate. A total of 5 GPT models are evaluated, using 10 different inference temperatures and 100 repetitions at each setting, resulting in 5,000 GPT queries per vulnerable source code analyzed. Ultimately, we find that the GPT models that we evaluated are not suitable for fully automated vulnerability scanning because the false positive and false negative rates are too high to likely be useful in practice. However, we do find that the GPT models perform surprisingly well at automated vulnerability detection for some of the test cases, in particular surpassing random sampling, and being able to identify the exact lines of code that are vulnerable albeit at a low success rate. The best performing GPT model result found was Llama-2-70b-chat-hf with inference temperature of 0.1 applied to NIST SARD test case 149165 (which is an example of a buffer overflow vulnerability), which had a binary classification recall score of 1.0 and a precision of 1.0 for correctly and uniquely identifying the vulnerable line of code and the correct CWE number.</description>

      <title>OmniParser for Pure Vision Based GUI Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent success of large vision language models shows great potential in driving the agent system operating on user interfaces. However, we argue that the power multimodal models like GPT-4V as a general agent on multiple operating systems across different applications is largely underestimated due to the lack of a robust screen parsing technique capable of: 1) reliably identifying interactable icons within the user interface, and 2) understanding the semantics of various elements in a screenshot and accurately associate the intended action with the corresponding region on the screen. To fill these gaps, we introduce \textsc{OmniParser}, a comprehensive method for parsing user interface screenshots into structured elements, which significantly enhances the ability of GPT-4V to generate actions that can be accurately grounded in the corresponding regions of the interface. We first curated an interactable icon detection dataset using popular webpages and an icon description dataset. These datasets were utilized to fine-tune specialized models: a detection model to parse interactable regions on the screen and a caption model to extract the functional semantics of the detected elements. \textsc{OmniParser} significantly improves GPT-4V's performance on ScreenSpot benchmark. And on Mind2Web and AITW benchmark, \textsc{OmniParser} with screenshot only input outperforms the GPT-4V baselines requiring additional information outside of screenshot.</description>

      <title>A Prior Embedding-Driven Architecture for Long Distance Blind Iris Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blind iris images, which result from unknown degradation during the process of iris recognition at long distances, often lead to decreased iris recognition rates. Currently, little existing literature offers a solution to this problem. In response, we propose a prior embedding-driven architecture for long distance blind iris recognition. We first proposed a blind iris image restoration network called Iris-PPRGAN. To effectively restore the texture of the blind iris, Iris-PPRGAN includes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) used as a Prior Decoder, and a DNN used as the encoder. To extract iris features more efficiently, we then proposed a robust iris classifier by modifying the bottleneck module of InsightFace, which called Insight-Iris. A low-quality blind iris image is first restored by Iris-PPRGAN, then the restored iris image undergoes recognition via Insight-Iris. Experimental results on the public CASIA-Iris-distance dataset demonstrate that our proposed method significantly superior results to state-of-the-art blind iris restoration methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, Specifically, the recognition rate for long-distance blind iris images reaches 90% after processing with our methods, representing an improvement of approximately ten percentage points compared to images without restoration.</description>

      <title>Clover-2: Accurate Inference for Regressive Lightweight Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently suffer from inefficiencies, largely attributable to the discord between the requirements of auto-regressive decoding and the architecture of contemporary GPUs. Recently, regressive lightweight speculative decoding has garnered attention for its notable efficiency improvements in text generation tasks. This approach utilizes a lightweight regressive draft model, like a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or a single transformer decoder layer, leveraging sequential information to iteratively predict potential tokens. Specifically, RNN draft models are computationally economical but tend to deliver lower accuracy, while attention decoder layer models exhibit the opposite traits. This paper presents Clover-2, an advanced iteration of Clover, an RNN-based draft model designed to achieve comparable accuracy to that of attention decoder layer models while maintaining minimal computational overhead. Clover-2 enhances the model architecture and incorporates knowledge distillation to increase Clover's accuracy and improve overall efficiency. We conducted experiments using the open-source Vicuna 7B and LLaMA3-Instruct 8B models. The results demonstrate that Clover-2 surpasses existing methods across various model architectures, showcasing its efficacy and robustness.</description>

      <title>QUITO: Accelerating Long-Context Reasoning through Query-Guided Context Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) capabilities are foundational to the success of large language models (LLMs). Recently, context compression has attracted growing interest since it can largely reduce reasoning complexities and computation costs of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a novel Query-gUIded aTtention cOmpression (QUITO) method, which leverages attention of the question over the contexts to filter useless information. Specifically, we take a trigger token to calculate the attention distribution of the context in response to the question. Based on the distribution, we propose three different filtering methods to satisfy the budget constraints of the context length. We evaluate the QUITO using two widely-used datasets, namely, NaturalQuestions and ASQA. Experimental results demonstrate that QUITO significantly outperforms established baselines across various datasets and downstream LLMs, underscoring its effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/Wenshansilvia/attention_compressor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolution is the core component within deep neural networks and it is computationally intensive and time consuming. Tensor data layouts significantly impact convolution operations in terms of memory access and computational efficiency. Yet, there is still a lack of comprehensive performance characterization on data layouts on SIMD architectures concerning convolution methods. This paper proposes three novel data layouts for im2win convolution: NHWC, CHWN, and CHWN8, and introduces a set of general optimization techniques for both direct and im2win convolutions. We compare the optimized im2win convolution with the direct convolution and PyTorch's im2col-based convolution across the aforementioned layouts on SIMD machines. The experiments demonstrated that the im2win convolution with the new NHWC layout achieved up to 355% performance speedup over NCHW layout. Our optimizations also significantly improve the performance of both im2win and direct convolutions. Our optimized im2win and direct convolutions achieved up to 95% and 94% of machine's theoretical peak performance, respectively.</description>

      <title>Gradient Harmonization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) intends to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Many current methods focus on learning feature representations that are both discriminative for classification and invariant across domains by simultaneously optimizing domain alignment and classification tasks. However, these methods often overlook a crucial challenge: the inherent conflict between these two tasks during gradient-based optimization. In this paper, we delve into this issue and introduce two effective solutions known as Gradient Harmonization, including GH and GH++, to mitigate the conflict between domain alignment and classification tasks. GH operates by altering the gradient angle between different tasks from an obtuse angle to an acute angle, thus resolving the conflict and trade-offing the two tasks in a coordinated manner. Yet, this would cause both tasks to deviate from their original optimization directions. We thus further propose an improved version, GH++, which adjusts the gradient angle between tasks from an obtuse angle to a vertical angle. This not only eliminates the conflict but also minimizes deviation from the original gradient directions. Finally, for optimization convenience and efficiency, we evolve the gradient harmonization strategies into a dynamically weighted loss function using an integral operator on the harmonized gradient. Notably, GH/GH++ are orthogonal to UDA and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing UDA models. Theoretical insights and experimental analyses demonstrate that the proposed approaches not only enhance popular UDA baselines but also improve recent state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning via Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of the era of foundation models, pre-training and fine-tuning have become common paradigms. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning has garnered widespread attention due to its better balance between the number of learnable parameters and performance. However, some current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods only model a single modality and lack the utilization of structural knowledge in downstream tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-modal parameter-efficient fine-tuning method based on graph networks. Each image is fed into a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to generate a text description. The image and its corresponding text description are then processed by a frozen image encoder and text encoder to generate image features and text features, respectively. A graph is constructed based on the similarity of the multi-modal feature nodes, and knowledge and relationships relevant to these features are extracted from each node. Additionally, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) regularization is incorporated into the loss function to mitigate the problem of forgetting during task learning. The proposed model achieves test accuracies on the OxfordPets, Flowers102, and Food101 datasets that improve by 4.45%, 2.92%, and 0.23%, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/yunche0/GA-Net/tree/master.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Graph Representation Learning with Adversarial Cross-view Reconstruction and Information Bottleneck</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received extensive research attention due to their powerful information aggregation capabilities. Despite the success of GNNs, most of them suffer from the popularity bias issue in a graph caused by a small number of popular categories. Additionally, real graph datasets always contain incorrect node labels, which hinders GNNs from learning effective node representations. Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been shown to be effective in solving the above problems for node classification tasks. Most existing GCL methods are implemented by randomly removing edges and nodes to create multiple contrasting views, and then maximizing the mutual information (MI) between these contrasting views to improve the node feature representation. However, maximizing the mutual information between multiple contrasting views may lead the model to learn some redundant information irrelevant to the node classification task. To tackle this issue, we propose an effective Contrastive Graph Representation Learning with Adversarial Cross-view Reconstruction and Information Bottleneck (CGRL) for node classification, which can adaptively learn to mask the nodes and edges in the graph to obtain the optimal graph structure representation. Furthermore, we innovatively introduce the information bottleneck theory into GCLs to remove redundant information in multiple contrasting views while retaining as much information as possible about node classification. Moreover, we add noise perturbations to the original views and reconstruct the augmented views by constructing adversarial views to improve the robustness of node feature representation. Extensive experiments on real-world public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains an unsolved problem. Human preferences are highly distributed and can be captured at multiple levels of abstraction, from the individual to diverse populations. Organisational preferences, represented by standards and principles, are defined to mitigate reputational risk or meet legislative obligations. In this paper, we present ABC Align, a novel alignment methodology for LLMs that enables integration of the standards and preferences of a large media organisation into the LLM itself. We combine a set of data and methods that build on recent breakthroughs in synthetic data generation, preference optimisation, and post-training model quantisation. Our unified approach mitigates bias and improves accuracy, while preserving reasoning capability, as measured against standard benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Discretizing Continuous Action Space with Unimodal Probability Distributions for On-Policy Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For on-policy reinforcement learning, discretizing action space for continuous control can easily express multiple modes and is straightforward to optimize. However, without considering the inherent ordering between the discrete atomic actions, the explosion in the number of discrete actions can possess undesired properties and induce a higher variance for the policy gradient estimator. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward architecture that addresses this issue by constraining the discrete policy to be unimodal using Poisson probability distributions. This unimodal architecture can better leverage the continuity in the underlying continuous action space using explicit unimodal probability distributions. We conduct extensive experiments to show that the discrete policy with the unimodal probability distribution provides significantly faster convergence and higher performance for on-policy reinforcement learning algorithms in challenging control tasks, especially in highly complex tasks such as Humanoid. We provide theoretical analysis on the variance of the policy gradient estimator, which suggests that our attentively designed unimodal discrete policy can retain a lower variance and yield a stable learning process.</description>

      <title>ADBM: Adversarial diffusion bridge model for reliable adversarial purification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently Diffusion-based Purification (DiffPure) has been recognized as an effective defense method against adversarial examples. However, we find DiffPure which directly employs the original pre-trained diffusion models for adversarial purification, to be suboptimal. This is due to an inherent trade-off between noise purification performance and data recovery quality. Additionally, the reliability of existing evaluations for DiffPure is questionable, as they rely on weak adaptive attacks. In this work, we propose a novel Adversarial Diffusion Bridge Model, termed ADBM. ADBM directly constructs a reverse bridge from the diffused adversarial data back to its original clean examples, enhancing the purification capabilities of the original diffusion models. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation across various scenarios, ADBM has proven to be a superior and robust defense mechanism, offering significant promise for practical applications.</description>

      <title>OTAD: An Optimal Transport-Induced Robust Model for Agnostic Adversarial Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations of the inputs, posing a significant challenge to their reliability and robustness. Empirical methods such as adversarial training can defend against particular attacks but remain vulnerable to more powerful attacks. Alternatively, Lipschitz networks provide certified robustness to unseen perturbations but lack sufficient expressive power. To harness the advantages of both approaches, we design a novel two-step Optimal Transport induced Adversarial Defense (OTAD) model that can fit the training data accurately while preserving the local Lipschitz continuity. First, we train a DNN with a regularizer derived from optimal transport theory, yielding a discrete optimal transport map linking data to its features. By leveraging the map's inherent regularity, we interpolate the map by solving the convex integration problem (CIP) to guarantee the local Lipschitz property. OTAD is extensible to diverse architectures of ResNet and Transformer, making it suitable for complex data. For efficient computation, the CIP can be solved through training neural networks. OTAD opens a novel avenue for developing reliable and secure deep learning systems through the regularity of optimal transport maps. Empirical results demonstrate that OTAD can outperform other robust models on diverse datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tackle the recently introduced benchmark for whole-body humanoid control HumanoidBench using MuJoCo MPC. We find that sparse reward functions of HumanoidBench yield undesirable and unrealistic behaviors when optimized; therefore, we propose a set of regularization terms that stabilize the robot behavior across tasks. Current evaluations on a subset of tasks demonstrate that our proposed reward function allows achieving the highest HumanoidBench scores while maintaining realistic posture and smooth control signals. Our code is publicly available and will become a part of MuJoCo MPC, enabling rapid prototyping of robot behaviors.</description>

      <title>Neural Graph Matching for Video Retrieval in Large-Scale Video-driven E-commerce</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of the short video industry, traditional e-commerce has encountered a new paradigm, video-driven e-commerce, which leverages attractive videos for product showcases and provides both video and item services for users. Benefitting from the dynamic and visualized introduction of items,video-driven e-commerce has shown huge potential in stimulating consumer confidence and promoting sales. In this paper, we focus on the video retrieval task, facing the following challenges: (1) Howto handle the heterogeneities among users, items, and videos? (2)How to mine the complementarity between items and videos for better user understanding? In this paper, we first leverage the dual graph to model the co-existing of user-video and user-item interactions in video-driven e-commerce and innovatively reduce user preference understanding to a graph matching problem. To solve it, we further propose a novel bi-level Graph Matching Network(GMN), which mainly consists of node- and preference-level graph matching. Given a user, node-level graph matching aims to match videos and items, while preference-level graph matching aims to match multiple user preferences extracted from both videos and items. Then the proposed GMN can generate and improve user embedding by aggregating matched nodes or preferences from the dual graph in a bi-level manner. Comprehensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed GMN with significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., AUC+1.9% and CTR+7.15%). We have developed it on a well-known video-driven e-commerce platform, serving hundreds of millions of users every day</description>

      <title>Advancing Medical Image Segmentation: Morphology-Driven Learning with Diffusion Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the morphological structure of medical images and precisely segmenting the region of interest or abnormality is an important task that can assist in diagnosis. However, the unique properties of medical imaging make clear segmentation difficult, and the high cost and time-consuming task of labeling leads to a coarse-grained representation of ground truth. Facing with these problems, we propose a novel Diffusion Transformer Segmentation (DTS) model for robust segmentation in the presence of noise. We propose an alternative to the dominant Denoising U-Net encoder through experiments applying a transformer architecture, which captures global dependency through self-attention. Additionally, we propose k-neighbor label smoothing, reverse boundary attention, and self-supervised learning with morphology-driven learning to improve the ability to identify complex structures. Our model, which analyzes the morphological representation of images, shows better results than the previous models in various medical imaging modalities, including CT, MRI, and lesion images.</description>

      <title>Securing the Diagnosis of Medical Imaging: An In-depth Analysis of AI-Resistant Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is a rapidly developing area of medicine that uses significant resources to apply computer science and statistics to medical issues. ML's proponents laud its capacity to handle vast, complicated, and erratic medical data. It's common knowledge that attackers might cause misclassification by deliberately creating inputs for machine learning classifiers. Research on adversarial examples has been extensively conducted in the field of computer vision applications. Healthcare systems are thought to be highly difficult because of the security and life-or-death considerations they include, and performance accuracy is very important. Recent arguments have suggested that adversarial attacks could be made against medical image analysis (MedIA) technologies because of the accompanying technology infrastructure and powerful financial incentives. Since the diagnosis will be the basis for important decisions, it is essential to assess how strong medical DNN tasks are against adversarial attacks. Simple adversarial attacks have been taken into account in several earlier studies. However, DNNs are susceptible to more risky and realistic attacks. The present paper covers recent proposed adversarial attack strategies against DNNs for medical imaging as well as countermeasures. In this study, we review current techniques for adversarial imaging attacks, detections. It also encompasses various facets of these techniques and offers suggestions for the robustness of neural networks to be improved in the future.</description>

      <title>A Simple Background Augmentation Method for Object Detection with Diffusion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In computer vision, it is well-known that a lack of data diversity will impair model performance. In this study, we address the challenges of enhancing the dataset diversity problem in order to benefit various downstream tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation. We propose a simple yet effective data augmentation approach by leveraging advancements in generative models, specifically text-to-image synthesis technologies like Stable Diffusion. Our method focuses on generating variations of labeled real images, utilizing generative object and background augmentation via inpainting to augment existing training data without the need for additional annotations. We find that background augmentation, in particular, significantly improves the models' robustness and generalization capabilities. We also investigate how to adjust the prompt and mask to ensure the generated content comply with the existing annotations. The efficacy of our augmentation techniques is validated through comprehensive evaluations of the COCO dataset and several other key object detection benchmarks, demonstrating notable enhancements in model performance across diverse scenarios. This approach offers a promising solution to the challenges of dataset enhancement, contributing to the development of more accurate and robust computer vision models.</description>

      <title>DNTextSpotter: Arbitrary-Shaped Scene Text Spotting via Improved Denoising Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More and more end-to-end text spotting methods based on Transformer architecture have demonstrated superior performance. These methods utilize a bipartite graph matching algorithm to perform one-to-one optimal matching between predicted objects and actual objects. However, the instability of bipartite graph matching can lead to inconsistent optimization targets, thereby affecting the training performance of the model. Existing literature applies denoising training to solve the problem of bipartite graph matching instability in object detection tasks. Unfortunately, this denoising training method cannot be directly applied to text spotting tasks, as these tasks need to perform irregular shape detection tasks and more complex text recognition tasks than classification. To address this issue, we propose a novel denoising training method (DNTextSpotter) for arbitrary-shaped text spotting. Specifically, we decompose the queries of the denoising part into noised positional queries and noised content queries. We use the four Bezier control points of the Bezier center curve to generate the noised positional queries. For the noised content queries, considering that the output of the text in a fixed positional order is not conducive to aligning position with content, we employ a masked character sliding method to initialize noised content queries, thereby assisting in the alignment of text content and position. To improve the model's perception of the background, we further utilize an additional loss function for background characters classification in the denoising training part.Although DNTextSpotter is conceptually simple, it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks (Total-Text, SCUT-CTW1500, ICDAR15, and Inverse-Text), especially yielding an improvement of 11.3% against the best approach in Inverse-Text dataset.</description>

      <title>DiM-Gesture: Co-Speech Gesture Generation with Adaptive Layer Normalization Mamba-2 framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech-driven gesture generation is an emerging domain within virtual human creation, where current methods predominantly utilize Transformer-based architectures that necessitate extensive memory and are characterized by slow inference speeds. In response to these limitations, we propose \textit{DiM-Gestures}, a novel end-to-end generative model crafted to create highly personalized 3D full-body gestures solely from raw speech audio, employing Mamba-based architectures. This model integrates a Mamba-based fuzzy feature extractor with a non-autoregressive Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN) Mamba-2 diffusion architecture. The extractor, leveraging a Mamba framework and a WavLM pre-trained model, autonomously derives implicit, continuous fuzzy features, which are then unified into a singular latent feature. This feature is processed by the AdaLN Mamba-2, which implements a uniform conditional mechanism across all tokens to robustly model the interplay between the fuzzy features and the resultant gesture sequence. This innovative approach guarantees high fidelity in gesture-speech synchronization while maintaining the naturalness of the gestures. Employing a diffusion model for training and inference, our framework has undergone extensive subjective and objective evaluations on the ZEGGS and BEAT datasets. These assessments substantiate our model's enhanced performance relative to contemporary state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating competitive outcomes with the DiTs architecture (Persona-Gestors) while optimizing memory usage and accelerating inference speed.</description>

      <title>On the Limitations and Prospects of Machine Unlearning for Generative AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI), which aims to synthesize realistic and diverse data samples from latent variables or other data modalities, has achieved remarkable results in various domains, such as natural language, images, audio, and graphs. However, they also pose challenges and risks to data privacy, security, and ethics. Machine unlearning is the process of removing or weakening the influence of specific data samples or features from a trained model, without affecting its performance on other data or tasks. While machine unlearning has shown significant efficacy in traditional machine learning tasks, it is still unclear if it could help GenAI become safer and aligned with human desire. To this end, this position paper provides an in-depth discussion of the machine unlearning approaches for GenAI. Firstly, we formulate the problem of machine unlearning tasks on GenAI and introduce the background. Subsequently, we systematically examine the limitations of machine unlearning on GenAI models by focusing on the two representative branches: LLMs and image generative (diffusion) models. Finally, we provide our prospects mainly from three aspects: benchmark, evaluation metrics, and utility-unlearning trade-off, and conscientiously advocate for the future development of this field.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Whole Slide Pathology Foundation Models through Stain Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in digital pathology have led to the development of numerous foundational models that utilize self-supervised learning on patches extracted from gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs). While this approach leverages vast amounts of unlabeled data, we have discovered a significant issue: features extracted from these self-supervised models tend to cluster by individual WSIs, a phenomenon we term WSI-specific feature collapse. This problem can potentially limit the model's generalization ability and performance on various downstream tasks. To address this issue, we introduce Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model, a novel foundational model trained on patches that have undergone stain normalization. Stain normalization helps reduce color variability arising from different laboratories and scanners, enabling the model to learn more consistent features. Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model is trained using 285,153,903 patches extracted from a total of 34,795 WSIs, combining data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Our experiments demonstrate that Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model significantly mitigates the feature collapse problem, indicating that the model has learned more generalized features rather than overfitting to individual WSI characteristics. We compared Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model with state-of-the-art models across six downstream task datasets, and our results show that \name{} achieves excellent performance relative to the number of WSIs used and the model's parameter count. This suggests that the application of stain normalization has substantially improved the model's efficiency and generalization capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presented DriveArena, the first high-fidelity closed-loop simulation system designed for driving agents navigating in real scenarios. DriveArena features a flexible, modular architecture, allowing for the seamless interchange of its core components: Traffic Manager, a traffic simulator capable of generating realistic traffic flow on any worldwide street map, and World Dreamer, a high-fidelity conditional generative model with infinite autoregression. This powerful synergy empowers any driving agent capable of processing real-world images to navigate in DriveArena's simulated environment. The agent perceives its surroundings through images generated by World Dreamer and output trajectories. These trajectories are fed into Traffic Manager, achieving realistic interactions with other vehicles and producing a new scene layout. Finally, the latest scene layout is relayed back into World Dreamer, perpetuating the simulation cycle. This iterative process fosters closed-loop exploration within a highly realistic environment, providing a valuable platform for developing and evaluating driving agents across diverse and challenging scenarios. DriveArena signifies a substantial leap forward in leveraging generative image data for the driving simulation platform, opening insights for closed-loop autonomous driving. Code will be available soon on GitHub: https://github.com/PJLab-ADG/DriveArena</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of the panoramic activity recognition task is to identify behaviors at various granularities within crowded and complex environments, encompassing individual actions, social group activities, and global activities. Existing methods generally use either parameter-independent modules to capture task-specific features or parameter-sharing modules to obtain common features across all tasks. However, there is often a strong interrelatedness and complementary effect between tasks of different granularities that previous methods have yet to notice. In this paper, we propose a model called MPT-PAR that considers both the unique characteristics of each task and the synergies between different tasks simultaneously, thereby maximizing the utilization of features across multi-granularity activity recognition. Furthermore, we emphasize the significance of temporal and spatial information by introducing a spatio-temporal relation-enhanced module and a scene representation learning module, which integrate the the spatio-temporal context of action and global scene into the feature map of each granularity. Our method achieved an overall F1 score of 47.5\% on the JRDB-PAR dataset, significantly outperforming all the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Evolutionary-based Automated Machine Learning for Small Molecule Pharmacokinetic Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is revolutionising drug discovery by expediting the prediction of small molecule properties essential for developing new drugs. These properties -- including absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME)-- are crucial in the early stages of drug development since they provide an understanding of the course of the drug in the organism, i.e., the drug's pharmacokinetics. However, existing methods lack personalisation and rely on manually crafted ML algorithms or pipelines, which can introduce inefficiencies and biases into the process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel evolutionary-based automated ML method (AutoML) specifically designed for predicting small molecule properties, with a particular focus on pharmacokinetics. Leveraging the advantages of grammar-based genetic programming, our AutoML method streamlines the process by automatically selecting algorithms and designing predictive pipelines tailored to the particular characteristics of input molecular data. Results demonstrate AutoML's effectiveness in selecting diverse ML algorithms, resulting in comparable or even improved predictive performances compared to conventional approaches. By offering personalised ML-driven pipelines, our method promises to enhance small molecule research in drug discovery, providing researchers with a valuable tool for accelerating the development of novel therapeutic drugs.</description>

      <title>CARMIL: Context-Aware Regularization on Multiple Instance Learning models for Whole Slide Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models have proven effective for cancer prognosis from Whole Slide Images. However, the original MIL formulation incorrectly assumes the patches of the same image to be independent, leading to a loss of spatial context as information flows through the network. Incorporating contextual knowledge into predictions is particularly important given the inclination for cancerous cells to form clusters and the presence of spatial indicators for tumors. State-of-the-art methods often use attention mechanisms eventually combined with graphs to capture spatial knowledge. In this paper, we take a novel and transversal approach, addressing this issue through the lens of regularization. We propose Context-Aware Regularization for Multiple Instance Learning (CARMIL), a versatile regularization scheme designed to seamlessly integrate spatial knowledge into any MIL model. Additionally, we present a new and generic metric to quantify the Context-Awareness of any MIL model when applied to Whole Slide Images, resolving a previously unexplored gap in the field. The efficacy of our framework is evaluated for two survival analysis tasks on glioblastoma (TCGA GBM) and colon cancer data (TCGA COAD).</description>

      <title>Augmenting Channel Simulator and Semi- Supervised Learning for Efficient Indoor Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to tackle the labor-intensive and resource-consuming task of indoor positioning by proposing an efficient approach. The proposed approach involves the introduction of a semi-supervised learning (SSL) with a biased teacher (SSLB) algorithm, which effectively utilizes both labeled and unlabeled channel data. To reduce measurement expenses, unlabeled data is generated using an updated channel simulator (UCHS), and then weighted by adaptive confidence values to simplify the tuning of hyperparameters. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy achieves superior performance while minimizing measurement overhead and training expense compared to existing benchmarks, offering a valuable and practical solution for indoor positioning.</description>

      <title>A Qualitative Study on Using ChatGPT for Software Security: Perception vs. Practicality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements have enabled the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) that can perform a variety of tasks with remarkable semantic understanding and accuracy. ChatGPT is one such LLM that has gained significant attention due to its impressive capabilities for assisting in various knowledge-intensive tasks. Due to the knowledge-intensive nature of engineering secure software, ChatGPT's assistance is expected to be explored for security-related tasks during the development/evolution of software. To gain an understanding of the potential of ChatGPT as an emerging technology for supporting software security, we adopted a two-fold approach. Initially, we performed an empirical study to analyse the perceptions of those who had explored the use of ChatGPT for security tasks and shared their views on Twitter. It was determined that security practitioners view ChatGPT as beneficial for various software security tasks, including vulnerability detection, information retrieval, and penetration testing. Secondly, we designed an experiment aimed at investigating the practicality of this technology when deployed as an oracle in real-world settings. In particular, we focused on vulnerability detection and qualitatively examined ChatGPT outputs for given prompts within this prominent software security task. Based on our analysis, responses from ChatGPT in this task are largely filled with generic security information and may not be appropriate for industry use. To prevent data leakage, we performed this analysis on a vulnerability dataset compiled after the OpenAI data cut-off date from real-world projects covering 40 distinct vulnerability types and 12 programming languages. We assert that the findings from this study would contribute to future research aimed at developing and evaluating LLMs dedicated to software security.</description>

      <title>Focus, Distinguish, and Prompt: Unleashing CLIP for Efficient and Flexible Scene Text Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scene text retrieval aims to find all images containing the query text from an image gallery. Current efforts tend to adopt an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipeline, which requires complicated text detection and/or recognition processes, resulting in inefficient and inflexible retrieval. Different from them, in this work we propose to explore the intrinsic potential of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) for OCR-free scene text retrieval. Through empirical analysis, we observe that the main challenges of CLIP as a text retriever are: 1) limited text perceptual scale, and 2) entangled visual-semantic concepts. To this end, a novel model termed FDP (Focus, Distinguish, and Prompt) is developed. FDP first focuses on scene text via shifting the attention to the text area and probing the hidden text knowledge, and then divides the query text into content word and function word for processing, in which a semantic-aware prompting scheme and a distracted queries assistance module are utilized. Extensive experiments show that FDP significantly enhances the inference speed while achieving better or competitive retrieval accuracy compared to existing methods. Notably, on the IIIT-STR benchmark, FDP surpasses the state-of-the-art model by 4.37% with a 4 times faster speed. Furthermore, additional experiments under phrase-level and attribute-aware scene text retrieval settings validate FDP's particular advantages in handling diverse forms of query text. The source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Gyann-z/FDP.</description>

      <title>DiscipLink: Unfolding Interdisciplinary Information Seeking Process via Human-AI Co-Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interdisciplinary studies often require researchers to explore literature in diverse branches of knowledge. Yet, navigating through the highly scattered knowledge from unfamiliar disciplines poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce DiscipLink, a novel interactive system that facilitates collaboration between researchers and large language models (LLMs) in interdisciplinary information seeking (IIS). Based on users' topics of interest, DiscipLink initiates exploratory questions from the perspectives of possible relevant fields of study, and users can further tailor these questions. DiscipLink then supports users in searching and screening papers under selected questions by automatically expanding queries with disciplinary-specific terminologies, extracting themes from retrieved papers, and highlighting the connections between papers and questions. Our evaluation, comprising a within-subject comparative experiment and an open-ended exploratory study, reveals that DiscipLink can effectively support researchers in breaking down disciplinary boundaries and integrating scattered knowledge in diverse fields. The findings underscore the potential of LLM-powered tools in fostering information-seeking practices and bolstering interdisciplinary research.</description>

      <title>Image Super-Resolution with Taylor Expansion Approximation and Large Field Reception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-similarity techniques are booming in blind super-resolution (SR) due to accurate estimation of the degradation types involved in low-resolution images. However, high-dimensional matrix multiplication within self-similarity computation prohibitively consumes massive computational costs. We find that the high-dimensional attention map is derived from the matrix multiplication between Query and Key, followed by a softmax function. This softmax makes the matrix multiplication between Query and Key inseparable, posing a great challenge in simplifying computational complexity. To address this issue, we first propose a second-order Taylor expansion approximation (STEA) to separate the matrix multiplication of Query and Key, resulting in the complexity reduction from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N)$. Then, we design a multi-scale large field reception (MLFR) to compensate for the performance degradation caused by STEA. Finally, we apply these two core designs to laboratory and real-world scenarios by constructing LabNet and RealNet, respectively. Extensive experimental results tested on five synthetic datasets demonstrate that our LabNet sets a new benchmark in qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Tested on the RealWorld38 dataset, our RealNet achieves superior visual quality over existing methods. Ablation studies further verify the contributions of STEA and MLFR towards both LabNet and RealNet frameworks.</description>

      <title>Towards Explainable and Interpretable Musical Difficulty Estimation: A Parameter-efficient Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating music piece difficulty is important for organizing educational music collections. This process could be partially automatized to facilitate the educator's role. Nevertheless, the decisions performed by prevalent deep-learning models are hardly understandable, which may impair the acceptance of such a technology in music education curricula. Our work employs explainable descriptors for difficulty estimation in symbolic music representations. Furthermore, through a novel parameter-efficient white-box model, we outperform previous efforts while delivering interpretable results. These comprehensible outcomes emulate the functionality of a rubric, a tool widely used in music education. Our approach, evaluated in piano repertoire categorized in 9 classes, achieved 41.4% accuracy independently, with a mean squared error (MSE) of 1.7, showing precise difficulty estimation. Through our baseline, we illustrate how building on top of past research can offer alternatives for music difficulty assessment which are explainable and interpretable. With this, we aim to promote a more effective communication between the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) community and the music education one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-tailed data is a special type of multi-class imbalanced data with a very large amount of minority/tail classes that have a very significant combined influence. Long-tailed learning aims to build high-performance models on datasets with long-tailed distributions, which can identify all the classes with high accuracy, in particular the minority/tail classes. It is a cutting-edge research direction that has attracted a remarkable amount of research effort in the past few years. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of latest advances in long-tailed visual learning. We first propose a new taxonomy for long-tailed learning, which consists of eight different dimensions, including data balancing, neural architecture, feature enrichment, logits adjustment, loss function, bells and whistles, network optimization, and post hoc processing techniques. Based on our proposed taxonomy, we present a systematic review of long-tailed learning methods, discussing their commonalities and alignable differences. We also analyze the differences between imbalance learning and long-tailed learning approaches. Finally, we discuss prospects and future directions in this field.</description>

      <title>Graph Representation Learning via Causal Diffusion for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based recommendation algorithms typically assume that training and testing data are drawn from independent and identically distributed (IID) spaces. However, this assumption often fails in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, resulting in significant performance degradation. In this study, we construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to analyze interaction data, revealing that environmental confounders (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) lead to unstable correlations in GNN-based models, thus impairing their generalization to OOD data. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, graph representation learning via causal diffusion (CausalDiffRec) for OOD recommendation. This method enhances the model's generalization on OOD data by eliminating environmental confounding factors and learning invariant graph representations. Specifically, we use backdoor adjustment and variational inference to infer the real environmental distribution, thereby eliminating the impact of environmental confounders. This inferred distribution is then used as prior knowledge to guide the representation learning in the reverse phase of the diffusion process to learn the invariant representation. In addition, we provide a theoretical derivation that proves optimizing the objective function of CausalDiffRec can encourage the model to learn environment-invariant graph representations, thereby achieving excellent generalization performance in recommendations under distribution shifts. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CausalDiffRec in improving the generalization of OOD data, and the average improvement is up to 10.69% on Food, 18.83% on KuaiRec, 22.41% on Yelp2018, and 11.65% on Douban datasets.</description>

      <title>Jailbreaking Text-to-Image Models with LLM-Based Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements have significantly improved automated task-solving capabilities using autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs). However, most LLM-based agents focus on dialogue, programming, or specialized domains, leaving gaps in addressing generative AI safety tasks. These gaps are primarily due to the challenges posed by LLM hallucinations and the lack of clear guidelines. In this paper, we propose Atlas, an advanced LLM-based multi-agent framework that integrates an efficient fuzzing workflow to target generative AI models, specifically focusing on jailbreak attacks against text-to-image (T2I) models with safety filters. Atlas utilizes a vision-language model (VLM) to assess whether a prompt triggers the T2I model's safety filter. It then iteratively collaborates with both LLM and VLM to generate an alternative prompt that bypasses the filter. Atlas also enhances the reasoning abilities of LLMs in attack scenarios by leveraging multi-agent communication, in-context learning (ICL) memory mechanisms, and the chain-of-thought (COT) approach. Our evaluation demonstrates that Atlas successfully jailbreaks several state-of-the-art T2I models in a black-box setting, which are equipped with multi-modal safety filters. In addition, Atlas outperforms existing methods in both query efficiency and the quality of the generated images.</description>

      <title>Hilbert curves for efficient exploratory landscape analysis neighbourhood sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landscape analysis aims to characterise optimisation problems based on their objective (or fitness) function landscape properties. The problem search space is typically sampled, and various landscape features are estimated based on the samples. One particularly salient set of features is information content, which requires the samples to be sequences of neighbouring solutions, such that the local relationships between consecutive sample points are preserved. Generating such spatially correlated samples that also provide good search space coverage is challenging. It is therefore common to first obtain an unordered sample with good search space coverage, and then apply an ordering algorithm such as the nearest neighbour to minimise the distance between consecutive points in the sample. However, the nearest neighbour algorithm becomes computationally prohibitive in higher dimensions, thus there is a need for more efficient alternatives. In this study, Hilbert space-filling curves are proposed as a method to efficiently obtain high-quality ordered samples. Hilbert curves are a special case of fractal curves, and guarantee uniform coverage of a bounded search space while providing a spatially correlated sample. We study the effectiveness of Hilbert curves as samplers, and discover that they are capable of extracting salient features at a fraction of the computational cost compared to Latin hypercube sampling with post-factum ordering. Further, we investigate the use of Hilbert curves as an ordering strategy, and find that they order the sample significantly faster than the nearest neighbour ordering, without sacrificing the saliency of the extracted features.</description>

      <title>Intermittent Semi-working Mask: A New Masking Paradigm for LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues are a key interaction method between humans and Large Language Models (LLMs), as conversations extend over multiple rounds, keeping LLMs' high generation quality and low latency is a challenge. Mainstream LLMs can be grouped into two categories based on masking strategy: causal LLM and prefix LLM. Several works have demonstrated that prefix LLMs tend to outperform causal ones in scenarios that heavily depend on historical context such as multi-turn dialogues or in-context learning, thanks to their bidirectional attention on prefix sequences. However, prefix LLMs have an inherent inefficient training problem in multi-turn dialogue datasets. In addition, the attention mechanism of prefix LLM makes it unable to reuse Key-Value Cache (KV Cache) across dialogue rounds to reduce generation latency. In this paper, we propose a novel masking scheme called Intermittent Semi-working Mask (ISM) to address these problems. Specifically, we apply alternate bidirectional and unidirectional attention on queries and answers in the dialogue history. In this way, ISM is able to maintain the high quality of prefix LLM and low generation latency of causal LLM, simultaneously. Extensive experiments illustrate that our ISM achieves significant performance.</description>

      <title>The Energy Cost of Artificial Intelligence of Things Lifecycle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)coupled with existing Internet of Things (IoT) enables more streamlined and autonomous operations across various economic sectors. Consequently, the paradigm of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) having AI techniques at its core implies additional energy and carbon costs that may become significant with more complex neural architectures. To better understand the energy and Carbon Footprint (CF) of some AIoT components, very recent studies employ conventional metrics. However, these metrics are not designed to capture energy efficiency aspects of inference. In this paper, we propose a new metric, the Energy Cost of AIoT Lifecycle (eCAL) to capture the overall energy cost of inference over the lifecycle of an AIoT system. We devise a new methodology for determining eCAL of an AIoT system by analyzing the complexity of data manipulation in individual components involved in the AIoT lifecycle and derive the overall and per bit energy consumption. With eCAL we show that the better a model is and the more it is used, the more energy efficient an inference is. For an example AIoT configuration, eCAL for making $100$ inferences is $1.43$ times higher than for $1000$ inferences. We also evaluate the CF of the AIoT system by calculating the equivalent CO$_{2}$ emissions based on the energy consumption and the Carbon Intensity (CI) across different countries. Using 2023 renewable data, our analysis reveals that deploying an AIoT system in Germany results in emitting $4.62$ times higher CO$_2$ than in Finland, due to latter using more low-CI energy sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical data can often be considered as samples from a set of probability distributions. Kernel methods have emerged as a natural approach for learning to classify these distributions. Although numerous kernels between distributions have been proposed, applying kernel methods to distribution regression tasks remains challenging, primarily because selecting a suitable kernel is not straightforward. Surprisingly, the question of learning a data-dependent distribution kernel has received little attention. In this paper, we propose a novel objective for the unsupervised learning of data-dependent distribution kernel, based on the principle of entropy maximization in the space of probability measure embeddings. We examine the theoretical properties of the latent embedding space induced by our objective, demonstrating that its geometric structure is well-suited for solving downstream discriminative tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the learned kernel across different modalities.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Multilingual Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, they suffer from hallucination problems, where models generate plausible yet incorrect answers given the input image-query pair. This hallucination phenomenon is even more severe when querying the image in non-English languages, while existing methods for mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs only consider the English scenarios. In this paper, we make the first attempt to mitigate this important multilingual hallucination in LVLMs. With thorough experiment analysis, we found that multilingual hallucination in LVLMs is a systemic problem that could arise from deficiencies in multilingual capabilities or inadequate multimodal abilities. To this end, we propose a two-stage Multilingual Hallucination Removal (MHR) framework for LVLMs, aiming to improve resistance to hallucination for both high-resource and low-resource languages. Instead of relying on the intricate manual annotations of multilingual resources, we fully leverage the inherent capabilities of the LVLM and propose a novel cross-lingual alignment method, which generates multiple responses for each image-query input and then identifies the hallucination-aware pairs for each language. These data pairs are finally used for direct preference optimization to prompt the LVLMs to favor non-hallucinating responses. Experimental results show that our MHR achieves a substantial reduction in hallucination generation for LVLMs. Notably, on our extended multilingual POPE benchmark, our framework delivers an average increase of 19.0% in accuracy across 13 different languages.

      <title>Alleviating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models with Active Retrieval Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable ability of large vision-language models (LVLMs) in image comprehension, these models frequently generate plausible yet factually incorrect responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination.Recently, in large language models (LLMs), augmenting LLMs by retrieving information from external knowledge resources has been proven as a promising solution to mitigate hallucinations.However, the retrieval augmentation in LVLM significantly lags behind the widespread applications of LVLM. Moreover, when transferred to augmenting LVLMs, sometimes the hallucination degree of the model is even exacerbated.Motivated by the research gap and counter-intuitive phenomenon, we introduce a novel framework, the Active Retrieval-Augmented large vision-language model (ARA), specifically designed to address hallucinations by incorporating three critical dimensions: (i) dissecting the retrieval targets based on the inherent hierarchical structures of images. (ii) pinpointing the most effective retrieval methods and filtering out the reliable retrieval results. (iii) timing the retrieval process to coincide with episodes of low certainty, while circumventing unnecessary retrieval during periods of high certainty. To assess the capability of our proposed ARA model in reducing hallucination, we employ three widely used LVLM models (LLaVA-1.5, Qwen-VL, and mPLUG-Owl2) across four benchmarks. Our empirical observations suggest that by utilizing fitting retrieval mechanisms and timing the retrieval judiciously, we can effectively mitigate the hallucination problem. We hope that this study can provide deeper insights into how to adapt the retrieval augmentation to LVLMs for reducing hallucinations with more effective retrieval and minimal retrieval occurrences.</description>

      <title>Non Verbis, Sed Rebus: Large Language Models are Weak Solvers of Italian Rebuses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rebuses are puzzles requiring constrained multi-step reasoning to identify a hidden phrase from a set of images and letters. In this work, we introduce a large collection of verbalized rebuses for the Italian language and use it to assess the rebus-solving capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models. While general-purpose systems such as LLaMA-3 and GPT-4o perform poorly on this task, ad-hoc fine-tuning seems to improve models' performance. However, we find that performance gains from training are largely motivated by memorization. Our results suggest that rebus solving remains a challenging test bed to evaluate large language models' linguistic proficiency and sequential instruction-following skills.</description>

      <title>Closing the gap between open-source and commercial large language models for medical evidence summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise in summarizing medical evidence. Most recent studies focus on the application of proprietary LLMs. Using proprietary LLMs introduces multiple risk factors, including a lack of transparency and vendor dependency. While open-source LLMs allow better transparency and customization, their performance falls short compared to proprietary ones. In this study, we investigated to what extent fine-tuning open-source LLMs can further improve their performance in summarizing medical evidence. Utilizing a benchmark dataset, MedReview, consisting of 8,161 pairs of systematic reviews and summaries, we fine-tuned three broadly-used, open-sourced LLMs, namely PRIMERA, LongT5, and Llama-2. Overall, the fine-tuned LLMs obtained an increase of 9.89 in ROUGE-L (95% confidence interval: 8.94-10.81), 13.21 in METEOR score (95% confidence interval: 12.05-14.37), and 15.82 in CHRF score (95% confidence interval: 13.89-16.44). The performance of fine-tuned LongT5 is close to GPT-3.5 with zero-shot settings. Furthermore, smaller fine-tuned models sometimes even demonstrated superior performance compared to larger zero-shot models. The above trends of improvement were also manifested in both human and GPT4-simulated evaluations. Our results can be applied to guide model selection for tasks demanding particular domain knowledge, such as medical evidence summarization.</description>

      <title>DisTrack: a new Tool for Semi-automatic Misinformation Tracking in Online Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introduction: This article introduces DisTrack, a methodology and a tool developed for tracking and analyzing misinformation within Online Social Networks (OSNs). DisTrack is designed to combat the spread of misinformation through a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) Social Network Analysis (SNA) and graph visualization. The primary goal is to detect misinformation, track its propagation, identify its sources, and assess the influence of various actors within the network.
  Methods: DisTrack's architecture incorporates a variety of methodologies including keyword search, semantic similarity assessments, and graph generation techniques. These methods collectively facilitate the monitoring of misinformation, the categorization of content based on alignment with known false claims, and the visualization of dissemination cascades through detailed graphs. The tool is tailored to capture and analyze the dynamic nature of misinformation spread in digital environments.
  Results: The effectiveness of DisTrack is demonstrated through three case studies focused on different themes: discredit/hate speech, anti-vaccine misinformation, and false narratives about the Russia-Ukraine conflict. These studies show DisTrack's capabilities in distinguishing posts that propagate falsehoods from those that counteract them, and tracing the evolution of misinformation from its inception.
  Conclusions: The research confirms that DisTrack is a valuable tool in the field of misinformation analysis. It effectively distinguishes between different types of misinformation and traces their development over time. By providing a comprehensive approach to understanding and combating misinformation in digital spaces, DisTrack proves to be an essential asset for researchers and practitioners working to mitigate the impact of false information in online social environments.</description>

      <title>AMAES: Augmented Masked Autoencoder Pretraining on Public Brain MRI Data for 3D-Native Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of self-supervised pretraining of 3D semantic segmentation models on a large-scale, domain-specific dataset. We introduce BRAINS-45K, a dataset of 44,756 brain MRI volumes from public sources, the largest public dataset available, and revisit a number of design choices for pretraining modern segmentation architectures by simplifying and optimizing state-of-the-art methods, and combining them with a novel augmentation strategy. The resulting AMAES framework is based on masked-image-modeling and intensity-based augmentation reversal and balances memory usage, runtime, and finetuning performance. Using the popular U-Net and the recent MedNeXt architecture as backbones, we evaluate the effect of pretraining on three challenging downstream tasks, covering single-sequence, low-resource settings, and out-of-domain generalization. The results highlight that pretraining on the proposed dataset with AMAES significantly improves segmentation performance in the majority of evaluated cases, and that it is beneficial to pretrain the model with augmentations, despite pretraing on a large-scale dataset. Code and model checkpoints for reproducing results, as well as the BRAINS-45K dataset are available at \url{https://github.com/asbjrnmunk/amaes}.</description>

      <title>Learning in Multi-Objective Public Goods Games with Non-Linear Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing the question of how to achieve optimal decision-making under risk and uncertainty is crucial for enhancing the capabilities of artificial agents that collaborate with or support humans. In this work, we address this question in the context of Public Goods Games. We study learning in a novel multi-objective version of the Public Goods Game where agents have different risk preferences, by means of multi-objective reinforcement learning. We introduce a parametric non-linear utility function to model risk preferences at the level of individual agents, over the collective and individual reward components of the game. We study the interplay between such preference modelling and environmental uncertainty on the incentive alignment level in the game. We demonstrate how different combinations of individual preferences and environmental uncertainties sustain the emergence of cooperative patterns in non-cooperative environments (i.e., where competitive strategies are dominant), while others sustain competitive patterns in cooperative environments (i.e., where cooperative strategies are dominant).</description>

      <title>Accelerating Full Waveform Inversion By Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful tool for reconstructing material fields based on sparsely measured data obtained by wave propagation. For specific problems, discretizing the material field with a neural network (NN) improves the robustness and reconstruction quality of the corresponding optimization problem. We call this method NN-based FWI. Starting from an initial guess, the weights of the NN are iteratively updated to fit the simulated wave signals to the sparsely measured data set. For gradient-based optimization, a suitable choice of the initial guess, i.e., a suitable NN weight initialization, is crucial for fast and robust convergence.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel transfer learning approach to further improve NN-based FWI. This approach leverages supervised pretraining to provide a better NN weight initialization, leading to faster convergence of the subsequent optimization problem. Moreover, the inversions yield physically more meaningful local minima. The network is pretrained to predict the unknown material field using the gradient information from the first iteration of conventional FWI. In our computational experiments on two-dimensional domains, the training data set consists of reference simulations with arbitrarily positioned elliptical voids of different shapes and orientations. We compare the performance of the proposed transfer learning NN-based FWI with three other methods: conventional FWI, NN-based FWI without pretraining and conventional FWI with an initial guess predicted from the pretrained NN. Our results show that transfer learning NN-based FWI outperforms the other methods in terms of convergence speed and reconstruction quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of Artificial intelligence has promising advantages that can be utilized to transform the landscape of software project development. The Software process framework consists of activities that constantly require routine human interaction, leading to the possibility of errors and uncertainties. AI can assist software development managers, software testers, and other team members by leveraging LLMs, GenAI models, and AI agents to perform routine tasks, risk analysis and prediction, strategy recommendations, and support decision making. AI has the potential to increase efficiency and reduce the risks encountered by the project management team while increasing the project success rates. Additionally, it can also break down complex notions and development processes for stakeholders to make informed decisions. In this paper, we propose an approach in which AI tools and technologies can be utilized to bestow maximum assistance for agile software projects, which have become increasingly favored in the industry in recent years.</description>

      <title>Point-supervised Brain Tumor Segmentation with Box-prompted MedSAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Delineating lesions and anatomical structure is important for image-guided interventions. Point-supervised medical image segmentation (PSS) has great potential to alleviate costly expert delineation labeling. However, due to the lack of precise size and boundary guidance, the effectiveness of PSS often falls short of expectations. Although recent vision foundational models, such as the medical segment anything model (MedSAM), have made significant advancements in bounding-box-prompted segmentation, it is not straightforward to utilize point annotation, and is prone to semantic ambiguity. In this preliminary study, we introduce an iterative framework to facilitate semantic-aware point-supervised MedSAM. Specifically, the semantic box-prompt generator (SBPG) module has the capacity to convert the point input into potential pseudo bounding box suggestions, which are explicitly refined by the prototype-based semantic similarity. This is then succeeded by a prompt-guided spatial refinement (PGSR) module that harnesses the exceptional generalizability of MedSAM to infer the segmentation mask, which also updates the box proposal seed in SBPG. Performance can be progressively improved with adequate iterations. We conducted an evaluation on BraTS2018 for the segmentation of whole brain tumors and demonstrated its superior performance compared to traditional PSS methods and on par with box-supervised methods.</description>

      <title>Investigating Brain Connectivity and Regional Statistics from EEG for early stage Parkinson's Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the effectiveness of combining brain connectivity metrics with signal statistics for early stage Parkinson's Disease (PD) classification using electroencephalogram data (EEG). The data is from 5 arousal states - wakeful and four sleep stages (N1, N2, N3 and REM). Our pipeline uses an Ada Boost model for classification on a challenging early stage PD classification task with with only 30 participants (11 PD , 19 Healthy Control). Evaluating 9 brain connectivity metrics we find the best connectivity metric to be different for each arousal state with Phase Lag Index achieving the highest individual classification accuracy of 86\% on N1 data. Further to this our pipeline using regional signal statistics achieves an accuracy of 78\%, using brain connectivity only achieves an accuracy of 86\% whereas combining the two achieves a best accuracy of 91\%. This best performance is achieved on N1 data using Phase Lag Index (PLI) combined with statistics derived from the frequency characteristics of the EEG signal. This model also achieves a recall of 80 \% and precision of 96\%. Furthermore we find that on data from each arousal state, combining PLI with regional signal statistics improves classification accuracy versus using signal statistics or brain connectivity alone. Thus we conclude that combining brain connectivity statistics with regional EEG statistics is optimal for classifier performance on early stage Parkinson's. Additionally, we find outperformance of N1 EEG for classification of Parkinson's and expect this could be due to disrupted N1 sleep in PD. This should be explored in future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), a foundation model towards solving promptable visual segmentation in images and videos. We build a data engine, which improves model and data via user interaction, to collect the largest video segmentation dataset to date. Our model is a simple transformer architecture with streaming memory for real-time video processing. SAM 2 trained on our data provides strong performance across a wide range of tasks. In video segmentation, we observe better accuracy, using 3x fewer interactions than prior approaches. In image segmentation, our model is more accurate and 6x faster than the Segment Anything Model (SAM). We believe that our data, model, and insights will serve as a significant milestone for video segmentation and related perception tasks. We are releasing a version of our model, the dataset and an interactive demo.</description>

      <title>Pathway to Secure and Trustworthy 6G for LLMs: Attacks, Defense, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been gaining a lot of interest due to their adaptability and extensibility in emerging applications, including communication networks. It is anticipated that 6G mobile edge computing networks will be able to support LLMs as a service, as they provide ultra reliable low-latency communications and closed loop massive connectivity. However, LLMs are vulnerable to data and model privacy issues that affect the trustworthiness of LLMs to be deployed for user-based services. In this paper, we explore the security vulnerabilities associated with fine-tuning LLMs in 6G networks, in particular the membership inference attack. We define the characteristics of an attack network that can perform a membership inference attack if the attacker has access to the fine-tuned model for the downstream task. We show that the membership inference attacks are effective for any downstream task, which can lead to a personal data breach when using LLM as a service. The experimental results show that the attack success rate of maximum 92% can be achieved on named entity recognition task. Based on the experimental analysis, we discuss possible defense mechanisms and present possible research directions to make the LLMs more trustworthy in the context of 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Medicine with Iterative Follow-up Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergent abilities of large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in solving medical questions. They can possess considerable medical knowledge, but may still hallucinate and are inflexible in the knowledge updates. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to enhance the medical question-answering capabilities of LLMs with external knowledge bases, it may still fail in complex cases where multiple rounds of information-seeking are required. To address such an issue, we propose iterative RAG for medicine (i-MedRAG), where LLMs can iteratively ask follow-up queries based on previous information-seeking attempts. In each iteration of i-MedRAG, the follow-up queries will be answered by a vanilla RAG system and they will be further used to guide the query generation in the next iteration. Our experiments show the improved performance of various LLMs brought by i-MedRAG compared with vanilla RAG on complex questions from clinical vignettes in the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), as well as various knowledge tests in the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) dataset. Notably, our zero-shot i-MedRAG outperforms all existing prompt engineering and fine-tuning methods on GPT-3.5, achieving an accuracy of 69.68\% on the MedQA dataset. In addition, we characterize the scaling properties of i-MedRAG with different iterations of follow-up queries and different numbers of queries per iteration. Our case studies show that i-MedRAG can flexibly ask follow-up queries to form reasoning chains, providing an in-depth analysis of medical questions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first-of-its-kind study on incorporating follow-up queries into medical RAG.</description>

      <title>Leaf Angle Estimation using Mask R-CNN and LETR Vision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern day studies show a high degree of correlation between high yielding crop varieties and plants with upright leaf angles. It is observed that plants with upright leaf angles intercept more light than those without upright leaf angles, leading to a higher rate of photosynthesis. Plant scientists and breeders benefit from tools that can directly measure plant parameters in the field i.e. on-site phenotyping. The estimation of leaf angles by manual means in a field setting is tedious and cumbersome. We mitigate the tedium using a combination of the Mask R-CNN instance segmentation neural network, and Line Segment Transformer (LETR), a vision transformer. The proposed Computer Vision (CV) pipeline is applied on two image datasets, Summer 2015-Ames ULA and Summer 2015- Ames MLA, with a combined total of 1,827 plant images collected in the field using FieldBook, an Android application aimed at on-site phenotyping. The leaf angles estimated by the proposed pipeline on the image datasets are compared to two independent manual measurements using ImageJ, a Java-based image processing program developed at the National Institutes of Health and the Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation. The results, when compared for similarity using the Cosine Similarity measure, exhibit 0.98 similarity scores on both independent measurements of Summer 2015-Ames ULA and Summer 2015-Ames MLA image datasets, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed pipeline for on-site measurement of leaf angles.</description>

Abstract: Policy gradient methods have become a staple of any single-agent reinforcement learning toolbox, due to their combination of desirable properties: iterate convergence, efficient use of stochastic trajectory feedback, and theoretically-sound avoidance of importance sampling corrections. In multi-agent imperfect-information settings (extensive-form games), however, it is still unknown whether the same desiderata can be guaranteed while retaining theoretical guarantees. Instead, sound methods for extensive-form games rely on approximating counterfactual values (as opposed to Q values), which are incompatible with policy gradient methodologies. In this paper, we investigate whether policy gradient can be safely used in two-player zero-sum imperfect-information extensive-form games (EFGs). We establish positive results, showing for the first time that a policy gradient method leads to provable best-iterate convergence to a regularized Nash equilibrium in self-play.</description>

      <title>A deep learning-enabled smart garment for versatile sleep behaviour monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous monitoring and accurate detection of complex sleep patterns associated to different sleep-related conditions is essential, not only for enhancing sleep quality but also for preventing the risk of developing chronic illnesses associated to unhealthy sleep. Despite significant advances in research, achieving versatile recognition of various unhealthy and sub-healthy sleep patterns with simple wearable devices at home remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a robust and durable ultrasensitive strain sensor array printed on a smart garment, in its collar region. This solution allows detecting subtle vibrations associated with multiple sleep patterns at the extrinsic laryngeal muscles. Equipped with a deep learning neural network, it can precisely identify six sleep states-nasal breathing, mouth breathing, snoring, bruxism, central sleep apnea (CSA), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)-with an impressive accuracy of 98.6%, all without requiring specific positioning. We further demonstrate its explainability and generalization capabilities in practical applications. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) visualizations reflect comprehensive signal pattern analysis with low bias. Transfer learning tests show that the system can achieve high accuracy (overall accuracy of 95%) on new users with very few-shot learning (less than 15 samples per class). The scalable manufacturing process, robustness, high accuracy, and excellent generalization of the smart garment make it a promising tool for next-generation continuous sleep monitoring.</description>

      <title>Segment anything model 2: an application to 2D and 3D medical images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has gained significant attention because of its ability to segment a variety of objects in images given a prompt. The recently developed SAM 2 has extended this ability to video inputs. This opens an opportunity to apply SAM to 3D images, one of the fundamental tasks in the medical imaging field. In this paper, we provide an extensive evaluation of SAM 2's ability to segment both 2D and 3D medical images. We collect 18 medical imaging datasets, including common 3D modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) as well as 2D modalities such as X-ray and ultrasound. We consider two evaluation pipelines of SAM 2: (1) multi-frame 3D segmentation, where prompts are provided to one or multiple slice(s) selected from the volume, and (2) single-frame 2D segmentation, where prompts are provided to each slice. The former is only applicable to 3D modalities, while the latter applies to both 2D and 3D modalities. We learn that SAM 2 exhibits similar performance as SAM under single-frame 2D segmentation, and has variable performance under multi-frame 3D segmentation depending on the choices of slices to annotate, the direction of the propagation, the predictions utilized during the propagation, etc.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Energy Guidance: Guiding Diffusion Models with Reduced Energy Curvature of Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have shown remarkable success in visual content generation, producing high-quality samples across various domains, largely due to classifier-free guidance (CFG). Recent attempts to extend guidance to unconditional models have relied on heuristic techniques, resulting in suboptimal generation quality and unintended effects. In this work, we propose Smoothed Energy Guidance (SEG), a novel training- and condition-free approach that leverages the energy-based perspective of the self-attention mechanism to enhance image generation. By defining the energy of self-attention, we introduce a method to reduce the curvature of the energy landscape of attention and use the output as the unconditional prediction. Practically, we control the curvature of the energy landscape by adjusting the Gaussian kernel parameter while keeping the guidance scale parameter fixed. Additionally, we present a query blurring method that is equivalent to blurring the entire attention weights without incurring quadratic complexity in the number of tokens. In our experiments, SEG achieves a Pareto improvement in both quality and the reduction of side effects. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/SusungHong/SEG-SDXL}.</description>

      <title>Tamper-Resistant Safeguards for Open-Weight LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid advances in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have raised widespread concerns regarding their potential for malicious use. Open-weight LLMs present unique challenges, as existing safeguards lack robustness to tampering attacks that modify model weights. For example, recent works have demonstrated that refusal and unlearning safeguards can be trivially removed with a few steps of fine-tuning. These vulnerabilities necessitate new approaches for enabling the safe release of open-weight LLMs. We develop a method, called TAR, for building tamper-resistant safeguards into open-weight LLMs such that adversaries cannot remove the safeguards even after thousands of steps of fine-tuning. In extensive evaluations and red teaming analyses, we find that our method greatly improves tamper-resistance while preserving benign capabilities. Our results demonstrate that tamper-resistance is a tractable problem, opening up a promising new avenue to improve the safety and security of open-weight LLMs.</description>

      <title>AgentGen: Enhancing Planning Abilities for Large Language Model based Agent via Environment and Task Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based agents have garnered significant attention and are becoming increasingly popular. Furthermore, planning ability is a crucial component of an LLM-based agent, involving interaction with the environment and executing actions to complete a planning task, which generally entails achieving a desired goal from an initial state. This paper investigates enhancing the planning abilities of LLMs through instruction tuning, referred to as agent training. Recent studies have demonstrated that utilizing expert-level trajectory for instruction-tuning LLMs effectively enhances their planning capabilities. However, existing work primarily focuses on synthesizing trajectories from manually designed planning tasks and environments. The labor-intensive nature of creating these environments and tasks impedes the generation of sufficiently varied and extensive trajectories. To address this limitation, this paper explores the automated synthesis of diverse environments and a gradual range of planning tasks, from easy to difficult. We introduce a framework, AgentGen, that leverages LLMs first to generate environments and subsequently generate planning tasks conditioned on these environments. Specifically, to improve environmental diversity, we propose using an inspiration corpus composed of various domain-specific text segments as the context for synthesizing environments. Moreover, to increase the difficulty diversity of generated planning tasks, we propose a bidirectional evolution method, Bi-Evol, that evolves planning tasks from easier and harder directions to synthesize a task set with a smoother difficulty curve. The evaluation results derived from AgentBoard show that AgentGen greatly improves LLMs' planning ability, e.g., the AgentGen instruction-tuned Llama-3 8B surpasses GPT-3.5 in overall performance. Moreover, in certain tasks, it even outperforms GPT-4.</description>

      <title>MM-Vet v2: A Challenging Benchmark to Evaluate Large Multimodal Models for Integrated Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MM-Vet, with open-ended vision-language questions targeting at evaluating integrated capabilities, has become one of the most popular benchmarks for large multimodal model evaluation. MM-Vet assesses six core vision-language (VL) capabilities: recognition, knowledge, spatial awareness, language generation, OCR, and math. However, its question format is restricted to single image-text pairs, lacking the interleaved image and text sequences prevalent in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce MM-Vet v2, which includes a new VL capability called "image-text sequence understanding", evaluating models' ability to process VL sequences. Furthermore, we maintain the high quality of evaluation samples while further expanding the evaluation set size. Using MM-Vet v2 to benchmark large multimodal models, we found that Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the best model with a score of 71.8, slightly outperforming GPT-4o which scored 71.0. Among open-weight models, InternVL2-Llama3-76B leads with a score of 68.4.</description>

      <title>M^2ConceptBase: A Fine-Grained Aligned Concept-Centric Multimodal Knowledge Base</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal knowledge bases (MMKBs) provide cross-modal aligned knowledge crucial for multimodal tasks. However, the images in existing MMKBs are generally collected for entities in encyclopedia knowledge graphs. Therefore, detailed groundings of visual semantics with linguistic concepts are lacking, which are essential for the visual concept cognition ability of multimodal models. Addressing this gap, we introduce M^2ConceptBase, the first concept-centric MMKB. M^2ConceptBase models concepts as nodes with associated images and detailed textual descriptions. We propose a context-aware multimodal symbol grounding approach to align concept-image and concept-description pairs using context information from image-text datasets. Comprising 951K images and 152K concepts, M^2ConceptBase links each concept to an average of 6.27 images and a single description, ensuring comprehensive visual and textual semantics. Human studies confirm more than 95% alignment accuracy, underscoring its quality. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that M^2ConceptBase significantly enhances VQA model performance on the OK-VQA task. M^2ConceptBase also substantially improves the fine-grained concept understanding capabilities of multimodal large language models through retrieval augmentation in two concept-related tasks, highlighting its value.</description>

      <title>KGLens: Towards Efficient and Effective Knowledge Probing of Large Language Models with Knowledge Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) might hallucinate facts, while curated Knowledge Graph (KGs) are typically factually reliable especially with domain-specific knowledge. Measuring the alignment between KGs and LLMs can effectively probe the factualness and identify the knowledge blind spots of LLMs. However, verifying the LLMs over extensive KGs can be expensive. In this paper, we present KGLens, a Thompson-sampling-inspired framework aimed at effectively and efficiently measuring the alignment between KGs and LLMs. KGLens features a graph-guided question generator for converting KGs into natural language, along with a carefully designed importance sampling strategy based on parameterized KG structure to expedite KG traversal. Our simulation experiment compares the brute force method with KGLens under six different sampling methods, demonstrating that our approach achieves superior probing efficiency. Leveraging KGLens, we conducted in-depth analyses of the factual accuracy of ten LLMs across three large domain-specific KGs from Wikidata, composing over 19K edges, 700 relations, and 21K entities. Human evaluation results indicate that KGLens can assess LLMs with a level of accuracy nearly equivalent to that of human annotators, achieving 95.7% of the accuracy rate.</description>

      <title>A Dual-way Enhanced Framework from Text Matching Point of View for Multimodal Entity Linking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims at linking ambiguous mentions with multimodal information to entity in Knowledge Graph (KG) such as Wikipedia, which plays a key role in many applications. However, existing methods suffer from shortcomings, including modality impurity such as noise in raw image and ambiguous textual entity representation, which puts obstacles to MEL. We formulate multimodal entity linking as a neural text matching problem where each multimodal information (text and image) is treated as a query, and the model learns the mapping from each query to the relevant entity from candidate entities. This paper introduces a dual-way enhanced (DWE) framework for MEL: (1) our model refines queries with multimodal data and addresses semantic gaps using cross-modal enhancers between text and image information. Besides, DWE innovatively leverages fine-grained image attributes, including facial characteristic and scene feature, to enhance and refine visual features. (2)By using Wikipedia descriptions, DWE enriches entity semantics and obtains more comprehensive textual representation, which reduces between textual representation and the entities in KG. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, indicating the superiority of our model.

      <title>Modeling Latent Selection with Structural Causal Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Selection bias is ubiquitous in real-world data, and can lead to misleading results if not dealt with properly. We introduce a conditioning operation on Structural Causal Models (SCMs) to model latent selection from a causal perspective. We show that the conditioning operation transforms an SCM with the presence of an explicit latent selection mechanism into an SCM without such selection mechanism, which partially encodes the causal semantics of the selected subpopulation according to the original SCM. Furthermore, we show that this conditioning operation preserves the simplicity, acyclicity, and linearity of SCMs, and commutes with marginalization. Thanks to these properties, combined with marginalization and intervention, the conditioning operation offers a valuable tool for conducting causal reasoning tasks within causal models where latent details have been abstracted away. We demonstrate by example how classical results of causal inference can be generalized to include selection bias and how the conditioning operation helps with modeling of real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Learning Backdoors for Mixed Integer Linear Programs with Contrastive Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world problems can be efficiently modeled as Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) and solved with the Branch-and-Bound method. Prior work has shown the existence of MILP backdoors, small sets of variables such that prioritizing branching on them when possible leads to faster running times. However, finding high-quality backdoors that improve running times remains an open question. Previous work learns to estimate the relative solver speed of randomly sampled backdoors through ranking and then decide whether to use the highest-ranked backdoor candidate. In this paper, we utilize the Monte-Carlo tree search method to collect backdoors for training, rather than relying on random sampling, and adapt a contrastive learning framework to train a Graph Attention Network model to predict backdoors. Our method, evaluated on several common MILP problem domains, demonstrates performance improvements over both Gurobi and previous models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale survey tools enable the collection of citizen feedback in opinion corpora. Extracting the key arguments from a large and noisy set of opinions helps in understanding the opinions quickly and accurately. Fully automated methods can extract arguments but (1) require large labeled datasets that induce large annotation costs and (2) work well for known viewpoints, but not for novel points of view. We propose HyEnA, a hybrid (human + AI) method for extracting arguments from opinionated texts, combining the speed of automated processing with the understanding and reasoning capabilities of humans. We evaluate HyEnA on three citizen feedback corpora. We find that, on the one hand, HyEnA achieves higher coverage and precision than a state-of-the-art automated method when compared to a common set of diverse opinions, justifying the need for human insight. On the other hand, HyEnA requires less human effort and does not compromise quality compared to (fully manual) expert analysis, demonstrating the benefit of combining human and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Advancing Multimodal Data Fusion in Pain Recognition: A Strategy Leveraging Statistical Correlation and Human-Centered Perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research presents a novel multimodal data fusion methodology for pain behavior recognition, integrating statistical correlation analysis with human-centered insights. Our approach introduces two key innovations: 1) integrating data-driven statistical relevance weights into the fusion strategy to effectively utilize complementary information from heterogeneous modalities, and 2) incorporating human-centric movement characteristics into multimodal representation learning for detailed modeling of pain behaviors. Validated across various deep learning architectures, our method demonstrates superior performance and broad applicability. We propose a customizable framework that aligns each modality with a suitable classifier based on statistical significance, advancing personalized and effective multimodal fusion. Furthermore, our methodology provides explainable analysis of multimodal data, contributing to interpretable and explainable AI in healthcare. By highlighting the importance of data diversity and modality-specific representations, we enhance traditional fusion techniques and set new standards for recognizing complex pain behaviors. Our findings have significant implications for promoting patient-centered healthcare interventions and supporting explainable clinical decision-making.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) can be used to assess the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex scenarios where social reasoning is required. While the research community has proposed many ToM benchmarks, their hardness varies greatly, and their complexity is not well defined. This work proposes a framework to measure the complexity of ToM tasks. We quantify a problem's complexity as the number of states necessary to solve it correctly. Our complexity measure also accounts for spurious states of a ToM problem designed to make it apparently harder. We use our method to assess the complexity of five widely adopted ToM benchmarks. On top of this framework, we design a prompting technique that augments the information available to a model with a description of how the environment changes with the agents' interactions. We name this technique Discrete World Models (DWM) and show how it elicits superior performance on ToM tasks.</description>

Traditionally considered distinct paradigms, connectionist AI focuses on neural networks, while symbolic AI emphasizes symbolic representation and logic. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT and GPT-4, highlight the potential of connectionist architectures in handling human language as a form of symbols. The study argues that LLM-empowered Autonomous Agents (LAAs) embody this paradigm convergence. By utilizing LLMs for text-based knowledge modeling and representation, LAAs integrate neuro-symbolic AI principles, showcasing enhanced reasoning and decision-making capabilities. Comparing LAAs with Knowledge Graphs within the neuro-symbolic AI theme highlights the unique strengths of LAAs in mimicking human-like reasoning processes, scaling effectively with large datasets, and leveraging in-context samples without explicit re-training. The research underscores promising avenues in neuro-vector-symbolic integration, instructional encoding, and implicit reasoning, aimed at further enhancing LAA capabilities. By exploring the progression of neuro-symbolic AI and proposing future research trajectories, this work advances the understanding and development of AI technologies.</description>

      <title>eSPARQL: Representing and Reconciling Agnostic and Atheistic Beliefs in RDF-star Knowledge Graphs</title>

Abstract: Over the past few years, we have seen the emergence of large knowledge graphs combining information from multiple sources. Sometimes, this information is provided in the form of assertions about other assertions, defining contexts where assertions are valid. A recent extension to RDF which admits statements over statements, called RDF-star, is in revision to become a W3C standard. However, there is no proposal for a semantics of these RDF-star statements nor a built-in facility to operate over them. In this paper, we propose a query language for epistemic RDF-star metadata based on a four-valued logic, called eSPARQL. Our proposed query language extends SPARQL-star, the query language for RDF-star, with a new type of FROM clause to facilitate operating with multiple and sometimes conflicting beliefs. We show that the proposed query language can express four use case queries, including the following features: (i) querying the belief of an individual, (ii) the aggregating of beliefs, (iii) querying who is conflicting with somebody, and (iv) beliefs about beliefs (i.e., nesting of beliefs).</description>

      <title>A Generalized Projected Bellman Error for Off-policy Value Estimation in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.13844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many reinforcement learning algorithms rely on value estimation, however, the most widely used algorithms -- namely temporal difference algorithms -- can diverge under both off-policy sampling and nonlinear function approximation. Many algorithms have been developed for off-policy value estimation based on the linear mean squared projected Bellman error (MSPBE) and are sound under linear function approximation. Extending these methods to the nonlinear case has been largely unsuccessful. Recently, several methods have been introduced that approximate a different objective -- the mean-squared Bellman error (MSBE) -- which naturally facilitate nonlinear approximation. In this work, we build on these insights and introduce a new generalized MSPBE that extends the linear MSPBE to the nonlinear setting. We show how this generalized objective unifies previous work and obtain new bounds for the value error of the solutions of the generalized objective. We derive an easy-to-use, but sound, algorithm to minimize the generalized objective, and show that it is more stable across runs, is less sensitive to hyperparameters, and performs favorably across four control domains with neural network function approximation.</description>

      <title>Generalization in Neural Networks: A Broad Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.01610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews concepts, modeling approaches, and recent findings along a spectrum of different levels of abstraction of neural network models including generalization across (1) Samples, (2) Distributions, (3) Domains, (4) Tasks, (5) Modalities, and (6) Scopes. Strategies for (1) sample generalization from training to test data are discussed, with suggestive evidence presented that, at least for the ImageNet dataset, popular classification models show substantial overfitting. An empirical example and perspectives from statistics highlight how models' (2) distribution generalization can benefit from consideration of causal relationships and counterfactual scenarios. Transfer learning approaches and results for (3) domain generalization are summarized, as is the wealth of domain generalization benchmark datasets available. Recent breakthroughs surveyed in (4) task generalization include few-shot meta-learning approaches and the emergence of transformer-based foundation models such as those used for language processing. Studies performing (5) modality generalization are reviewed, including those that integrate image and text data and that apply a biologically-inspired network across olfactory, visual, and auditory modalities. Higher-level (6) scope generalization results are surveyed, including graph-based approaches to represent symbolic knowledge in networks and attribution strategies for improving networks' explainability. Additionally, concepts from neuroscience are discussed on the modular architecture of brains and the steps by which dopamine-driven conditioning leads to abstract thinking.</description>

      <title>Modelling Assessment Rubrics through Bayesian Networks: a Pragmatic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic assessment of learner competencies is a fundamental task in intelligent tutoring systems. An assessment rubric typically and effectively describes relevant competencies and competence levels. This paper presents an approach to deriving a learner model directly from an assessment rubric defining some (partial) ordering of competence levels. The model is based on Bayesian networks and exploits logical gates with uncertainty (often referred to as noisy gates) to reduce the number of parameters of the model, so to simplify their elicitation by experts and allow real-time inference in intelligent tutoring systems. We illustrate how the approach can be applied to automatize the human assessment of an activity developed for testing computational thinking skills. The simple elicitation of the model starting from the assessment rubric opens up the possibility of quickly automating the assessment of several tasks, making them more easily exploitable in the context of adaptive assessment tools and intelligent tutoring systems.</description>

      <title>Tiered Reward: Designing Rewards for Specification and Fast Learning of Desired Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03733v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement-learning agents seek to maximize a reward signal through environmental interactions. As humans, our job in the learning process is to design reward functions to express desired behavior and enable the agent to learn such behavior swiftly. However, designing good reward functions to induce the desired behavior is generally hard, let alone the question of which rewards make learning fast. In this work, we introduce a family of a reward structures we call Tiered Reward that addresses both of these questions. We consider the reward-design problem in tasks formulated as reaching desirable states and avoiding undesirable states. To start, we propose a strict partial ordering of the policy space to resolve trade-offs in behavior preference. We prefer policies that reach the good states faster and with higher probability while avoiding the bad states longer. Next, we introduce Tiered Reward, a class of environment-independent reward functions and show it is guaranteed to induce policies that are Pareto-optimal according to our preference relation. Finally, we demonstrate that Tiered Reward leads to fast learning with multiple tabular and deep reinforcement-learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Hidden Poison: Machine Unlearning Enables Camouflaged Poisoning Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.10717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce camouflaged data poisoning attacks, a new attack vector that arises in the context of machine unlearning and other settings when model retraining may be induced. An adversary first adds a few carefully crafted points to the training dataset such that the impact on the model's predictions is minimal. The adversary subsequently triggers a request to remove a subset of the introduced points at which point the attack is unleashed and the model's predictions are negatively affected. In particular, we consider clean-label targeted attacks (in which the goal is to cause the model to misclassify a specific test point) on datasets including CIFAR-10, Imagenette, and Imagewoof. This attack is realized by constructing camouflage datapoints that mask the effect of a poisoned dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07865v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research is aimed to solve the tweet/user geolocation prediction task and provide a flexible methodology for the geotagging of textual big data. The suggested approach implements neural networks for natural language processing (NLP) to estimate the location as coordinate pairs (longitude, latitude) and two-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). The scope of proposed models has been finetuned on a Twitter dataset using pretrained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) as base models. Performance metrics show a median error of fewer than 30 km on a worldwide-level, and fewer than 15 km on the US-level datasets for the models trained and evaluated on text features of tweets' content and metadata context.

      <title>Ultra-High-Resolution Detector Simulation with Intra-Event Aware GAN and Self-Supervised Relational Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating high-resolution detector responses is a computationally intensive process that has long been challenging in Particle Physics. Despite the ability of generative models to streamline it, full ultra-high-granularity detector simulation still proves to be difficult as it contains correlated and fine-grained information. To overcome these limitations, we propose Intra-Event Aware Generative Adversarial Network (IEA-GAN). IEA-GAN presents a Relational Reasoning Module that approximates an event in detector simulation, generating contextualized high-resolution full detector responses with a proper relational inductive bias. IEA-GAN also introduces a Self-Supervised intra-event aware loss and Uniformity loss, significantly enhancing sample fidelity and diversity. We demonstrate IEA-GAN's application in generating sensor-dependent images for the ultra-high-granularity Pixel Vertex Detector (PXD), with more than 7.5 M information channels at the Belle II Experiment. Applications of this work span from Foundation Models for high-granularity detector simulation, such as at the HL-LHC (High Luminosity LHC), to simulation-based inference and fine-grained density estimation. To our knowledge, IEA-GAN is the first algorithm for faithful ultra-high-granularity full detector simulation with event-based reasoning.</description>

      <title>Technical Note: Defining and Quantifying AND-OR Interactions for Faithful and Concise Explanation of DNNs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this technical note, we aim to explain a deep neural network (DNN) by quantifying the encoded interactions between input variables, which reflects the DNN's inference logic. Specifically, we first rethink the definition of interactions, and then formally define faithfulness and conciseness for interaction-based explanation. To this end, we propose two kinds of interactions, i.e., the AND interaction and the OR interaction. For faithfulness, we prove the uniqueness of the AND (OR) interaction in quantifying the effect of the AND (OR) relationship between input variables. Besides, based on AND-OR interactions, we design techniques to boost the conciseness of the explanation, while not hurting the faithfulness. In this way, the inference logic of a DNN can be faithfully and concisely explained by a set of symbolic concepts.</description>

      <title>Seed Kernel Counting using Domain Randomization and Object Tracking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) of seeds, also known as seed phenotyping, is the comprehensive assessment of complex seed traits such as growth, development, tolerance, resistance, ecology, yield, and the measurement of parameters that form more complex traits. One of the key aspects of seed phenotyping is cereal yield estimation that the seed production industry relies upon to conduct their business. While mechanized seed kernel counters are available in the market currently, they are often priced high and sometimes outside the range of small scale seed production firms' affordability. The development of object tracking neural network models such as You Only Look Once (YOLO) enables computer scientists to design algorithms that can estimate cereal yield inexpensively. The key bottleneck with neural network models is that they require a plethora of labelled training data before they can be put to task. We demonstrate that the use of synthetic imagery serves as a feasible substitute to train neural networks for object tracking that includes the tasks of object classification and detection. Furthermore, we propose a seed kernel counter that uses a low-cost mechanical hopper, trained YOLOv8 neural network model, and object tracking algorithms on StrongSORT and ByteTrack to estimate cereal yield from videos. The experiment yields a seed kernel count with an accuracy of 95.2\% and 93.2\% for Soy and Wheat respectively using the StrongSORT algorithm, and an accuray of 96.8\% and 92.4\% for Soy and Wheat respectively using the ByteTrack algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the promising results of machine learning models in malicious files detection, they face the problem of concept drift due to their constant evolution. This leads to declining performance over time, as the data distribution of the new files differs from the training one, requiring frequent model update. In this work, we propose a model-agnostic protocol to improve a baseline neural network against drift. We show the importance of feature reduction and training with the most recent validation set possible, and propose a loss function named Drift-Resilient Binary Cross-Entropy, an improvement to the classical Binary Cross-Entropy more effective against drift. We train our model on the EMBER dataset, published in2018, and evaluate it on a dataset of recent malicious files, collected between 2020 and 2023. Our improved model shows promising results, detecting 15.2% more malware than a baseline model.</description>

      <title>Multi-Source Domain Adaptation for Object Detection with Prototype-based Mean-teacher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adapting visual object detectors to operational target domains is a challenging task, commonly achieved using unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods. Recent studies have shown that when the labeled dataset comes from multiple source domains, treating them as separate domains and performing a multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) improves the accuracy and robustness over blending these source domains and performing a UDA. For adaptation, existing MSDA methods learn domain-invariant and domain-specific parameters (for each source domain). However, unlike single-source UDA methods, learning domain-specific parameters makes them grow significantly in proportion to the number of source domains. This paper proposes a novel MSDA method called Prototype-based Mean Teacher (PMT), which uses class prototypes instead of domain-specific subnets to encode domain-specific information. These prototypes are learned using a contrastive loss, aligning the same categories across domains and separating different categories far apart. Given the use of prototypes, the number of parameters required for our PMT method does not increase significantly with the number of source domains, thus reducing memory issues and possible overfitting. Empirical studies indicate that PMT outperforms state-of-the-art MSDA methods on several challenging object detection datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/imatif17/Prototype-Mean-Teacher.</description>

      <title>LLMs as Hackers: Autonomous Linux Privilege Escalation Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11409v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Penetration testing, an essential component of software security testing, allows organizations to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in their systems, thus bolstering their defense mechanisms against cyberattacks. One recent advancement in the realm of penetration testing is the utilization of Language Models (LLMs). We explore the intersection of LLMs and penetration testing to gain insight into their capabilities and challenges in the context of privilege escalation. We introduce a fully automated privilege-escalation tool designed for evaluating the efficacy of LLMs for (ethical) hacking, executing benchmarks using multiple LLMs, and investigating their respective results.
  Our results show that GPT-4-turbo is well suited to exploit vulnerabilities (33-83% of vulnerabilities). GPT-3.5-turbo can abuse 16-50% of vulnerabilities, while local models, such as Llama3, can only exploit between 0 and 33% of the vulnerabilities.
  We analyze the impact of different context sizes, in-context learning, optional high-level guidance mechanisms, and memory management techniques. We discuss challenging areas for LLMs, including maintaining focus during testing, coping with errors, and finally comparing LLMs with human hackers.
  The current version of the LLM-guided privilege-escalation prototype can be found at https://github.com/ipa-labs/hackingBuddyGPT.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Local Explainability and Trust Scores with Random Forest Proximities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate a novel approach to explain the predictions and out of sample performance of random forest (RF) regression and classification models by exploiting the fact that any RF can be mathematically formulated as an adaptive weighted K nearest-neighbors model. Specifically, we employ a recent result that, for both regression and classification tasks, any RF prediction can be rewritten exactly as a weighted sum of the training targets, where the weights are RF proximities between the corresponding pairs of data points. We show that this linearity facilitates a local notion of explainability of RF predictions that generates attributions for any model prediction across observations in the training set, and thereby complements established feature-based methods like SHAP, which generate attributions for a model prediction across input features. We show how this proximity-based approach to explainability can be used in conjunction with SHAP to explain not just the model predictions, but also out-of-sample performance, in the sense that proximities furnish a novel means of assessing when a given model prediction is more or less likely to be correct. We demonstrate this approach in the modeling of US corporate bond prices and returns in both regression and classification cases.</description>

      <title>SC-MIL: Sparsely Coded Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been widely used in weakly supervised whole slide image (WSI) classification. Typical MIL methods include a feature embedding part, which embeds the instances into features via a pre-trained feature extractor, and an MIL aggregator that combines instance embeddings into predictions. Most efforts have typically focused on improving these parts. This involves refining the feature embeddings through self-supervised pre-training as well as modeling the correlations between instances separately.
  In this paper, we proposed a sparsely coding MIL (SC-MIL) method that addresses those two aspects at the same time by leveraging sparse dictionary learning. The sparse dictionary learning captures the similarities of instances by expressing them as sparse linear combinations of atoms in an over-complete dictionary. In addition, imposing sparsity improves instance feature embeddings by suppressing irrelevant instances while retaining the most relevant ones. To make the conventional sparse coding algorithm compatible with deep learning, we unrolled it into a sparsely coded module leveraging deep unrolling. The proposed SC module can be incorporated into any existing MIL framework in a plug-and-play manner with an acceptable computational cost. The experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrated that the proposed SC module could substantially boost the performance of state-of-the-art MIL methods.

      <title>TriDeNT: Triple Deep Network Training for Privileged Knowledge Distillation in Histopathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational pathology models rarely utilise data that will not be available for inference. This means most models cannot learn from highly informative data such as additional immunohistochemical (IHC) stains and spatial transcriptomics. We present TriDeNT, a novel self-supervised method for utilising privileged data that is not available during inference to improve performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method for a range of different paired data including immunohistochemistry, spatial transcriptomics and expert nuclei annotations. In all settings, TriDeNT outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks, with observed improvements of up to 101%. Furthermore, we provide qualitative and quantitative measurements of the features learned by these models and how they differ from baselines. TriDeNT offers a novel method to distil knowledge from scarce or costly data during training, to create significantly better models for routine inputs.</description>

      <title>Lite-Mind: Towards Efficient and Robust Brain Representation Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03781v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The limited data availability and the low signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI signals lead to the challenging task of fMRI-to-image retrieval. State-of-the-art MindEye remarkably improves fMRI-to-image retrieval performance by leveraging a large model, i.e., a 996M MLP Backbone per subject, to align fMRI embeddings to the final hidden layer of CLIP's Vision Transformer (ViT). However, significant individual variations exist among subjects, even under identical experimental setups, mandating the training of large subject-specific models. The substantial parameters pose significant challenges in deploying fMRI decoding on practical devices. To this end, we propose Lite-Mind, a lightweight, efficient, and robust brain representation learning paradigm based on Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), which efficiently aligns fMRI voxels to fine-grained information of CLIP. We elaborately design a DFT backbone with Spectrum Compression and Frequency Projector modules to learn informative and robust voxel embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that Lite-Mind achieves an impressive 94.6% fMRI-to-image retrieval accuracy on the NSD dataset for Subject 1, with 98.7% fewer parameters than MindEye. Lite-Mind is also proven to be able to be migrated to smaller fMRI datasets and establishes a new state-of-the-art for zero-shot classification on the GOD dataset.</description>

      <title>The DSA Transparency Database: Auditing Self-reported Moderation Actions by Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since September 2023, the Digital Services Act (DSA) obliges large online platforms to submit detailed data on each moderation action they take within the European Union (EU) to the DSA Transparency Database. From its inception, this centralized database has sparked scholarly interest as an unprecedented and potentially unique trove of data on real-world online moderation. Here, we thoroughly analyze all 353.12M records submitted by the eight largest social media platforms in the EU during the first 100 days of the database. Specifically, we conduct a platform-wise comparative study of their: volume of moderation actions, grounds for decision, types of applied restrictions, types of moderated content, timeliness in undertaking and submitting moderation actions, and use of automation. Furthermore, we systematically cross-check the contents of the database with the platforms' own transparency reports. Our analyses reveal that (i) the platforms adhered only in part to the philosophy and structure of the database, (ii) the structure of the database is partially inadequate for the platforms' reporting needs, (iii) the platforms exhibited substantial differences in their moderation actions, (iv) a remarkable fraction of the database data is inconsistent, (v) the platform X (formerly Twitter) presents the most inconsistencies. Our findings have far-reaching implications for policymakers and scholars across diverse disciplines. They offer guidance for future regulations that cater to the reporting needs of online platforms in general, but also highlight opportunities to improve and refine the database itself.</description>

      <title>Fairness Concerns in App Reviews: A Study on AI-based Mobile Apps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08097v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fairness is one of the socio-technical concerns that must be addressed in software systems. Considering the popularity of mobile software applications (apps) among a wide range of individuals worldwide, mobile apps with unfair behaviors and outcomes can affect a significant proportion of the global population, potentially more than any other type of software system. Users express a wide range of socio-technical concerns in mobile app reviews. This research aims to investigate fairness concerns raised in mobile app reviews. Our research focuses on AI-based mobile app reviews as the chance of unfair behaviors and outcomes in AI-based mobile apps may be higher than in non-AI-based apps. To this end, we first manually constructed a ground-truth dataset, including 1,132 fairness and 1,473 non-fairness reviews. Leveraging the ground-truth dataset, we developed and evaluated a set of machine learning and deep learning models that distinguish fairness reviews from non-fairness reviews. Our experiments show that our best-performing model can detect fairness reviews with a precision of 94%. We then applied the best-performing model on approximately 9.5M reviews collected from 108 AI-based apps and identified around 92K fairness reviews. Next, applying the K-means clustering technique to the 92K fairness reviews, followed by manual analysis, led to the identification of six distinct types of fairness concerns (e.g., 'receiving different quality of features and services in different platforms and devices' and 'lack of transparency and fairness in dealing with user-generated content'). Finally, the manual analysis of 2,248 app owners' responses to the fairness reviews identified six root causes (e.g., 'copyright issues') that app owners report to justify fairness concerns.</description>

      <title>Blackout Mitigation via Physics-guided RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the sequential design of remedial control actions in response to system anomalies for the ultimate objective of preventing blackouts. A physics-guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework is designed to identify effective sequences of real-time remedial look-ahead decisions accounting for the long-term impact on the system's stability. The paper considers a space of control actions that involve both discrete-valued transmission line-switching decisions (line reconnections and removals) and continuous-valued generator adjustments. To identify an effective blackout mitigation policy, a physics-guided approach is designed that uses power-flow sensitivity factors associated with the power transmission network to guide the RL exploration during agent training. Comprehensive empirical evaluations using the open-source Grid2Op platform demonstrate the notable advantages of incorporating physical signals into RL decisions, establishing the gains of the proposed physics-guided approach compared to its black box counterparts. One important observation is that strategically~\emph{removing} transmission lines, in conjunction with multiple real-time generator adjustments, often renders effective long-term decisions that are likely to prevent or delay blackouts.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Self-training Framework for Fine-grained Scene Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09786v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scene graph generation (SGG) models have suffered from inherent problems regarding the benchmark datasets such as the long-tailed predicate distribution and missing annotation problems. In this work, we aim to alleviate the long-tailed problem of SGG by utilizing unannotated triplets. To this end, we introduce a Self-Training framework for SGG (ST-SGG) that assigns pseudo-labels for unannotated triplets based on which the SGG models are trained. While there has been significant progress in self-training for image recognition, designing a self-training framework for the SGG task is more challenging due to its inherent nature such as the semantic ambiguity and the long-tailed distribution of predicate classes. Hence, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling technique for SGG, called Class-specific Adaptive Thresholding with Momentum (CATM), which is a model-agnostic framework that can be applied to any existing SGG models. Furthermore, we devise a graph structure learner (GSL) that is beneficial when adopting our proposed self-training framework to the state-of-the-art message-passing neural network (MPNN)-based SGG models. Our extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of ST-SGG on various SGG models, particularly in enhancing the performance on fine-grained predicate classes.</description>

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of democratizing advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) by compressing their mathematical reasoning capabilities into sub-billion parameter Small Language Models (SLMs) without compromising performance. We introduce Equation-of-Thought Distillation (EoTD), a novel technique that encapsulates the reasoning process into equation-based representations to construct an EoTD dataset for fine-tuning SLMs. Additionally, we propose the Ensemble Thoughts Distillation (ETD) framework to enhance the reasoning performance of SLMs. This involves creating a reasoning dataset with multiple thought processes, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Program-of-Thought (PoT), and Equation-of-Thought (EoT), and using it for fine-tuning. Our experimental performance demonstrates that EoTD significantly boosts the reasoning abilities of SLMs, while ETD enables these models to achieve state-of-the-art reasoning performance.</description>

      <title>DefInt: A Default-interventionist Framework for Efficient Reasoning with Hybrid Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive emergent abilities in a wide range of tasks, but still face challenges in handling complex reasoning problems. Previous works like chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thoughts (ToT) have predominately focused on enhancing accuracy, but overlook the rapidly increasing token cost, which could be particularly problematic for open-ended real-world tasks with huge solution spaces. Motivated by the dual process theory of human cognition, we propose a Default-Interventionist framework (DefInt) to unleash the synergistic potential of hybrid LLMs. By default, DefInt uses smaller-scale language models to generate low-cost reasoning thoughts, which resembles the fast intuitions produced by System 1. If the intuitions are considered with low confidence, DefInt will invoke the reflective reasoning of scaled-up language models as the intervention of System 2, which can override the default thoughts and rectify the reasoning process. Experiments on five representative reasoning tasks show that DefInt consistently achieves state-of-the-art reasoning accuracy and solution diversity. More importantly, it substantially reduces the token cost by 49%-79% compared to the second accurate baselines. Specifically, the open-ended tasks have an average 75% token cost reduction. Code repo with all prompts will be released upon publication.</description>

      <title>Reputational Algorithm Aversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15418v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People are often reluctant to incorporate information produced by algorithms into their decisions, a phenomenon called ``algorithm aversion''. This paper shows how algorithm aversion arises when the choice to follow an algorithm conveys information about a human's ability. I develop a model in which workers make forecasts of an uncertain outcome based on their own private information and an algorithm's signal. Low-skill workers receive worse information than the algorithm and hence should always follow the algorithm's signal, while high-skill workers receive better information than the algorithm and should sometimes override it. However, due to reputational concerns, low-skill workers inefficiently override the algorithm to increase the likelihood they are perceived as high-skill. The model provides a fully rational microfoundation for algorithm aversion that aligns with the broad concern that AI systems will displace many types of workers.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating and Reducing Shortcuts in Vision-Language Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) mainly rely on contrastive training to learn general-purpose representations of images and captions. We focus on the situation when one image is associated with several captions, each caption containing both information shared among all captions and unique information per caption about the scene depicted in the image. In such cases, it is unclear whether contrastive losses are sufficient for learning task-optimal representations that contain all the information provided by the captions or whether the contrastive learning setup encourages the learning of a simple shortcut that minimizes contrastive loss. We introduce synthetic shortcuts for vision-language: a training and evaluation framework where we inject synthetic shortcuts into image-text data. We show that contrastive VLMs trained from scratch or fine-tuned with data containing these synthetic shortcuts mainly learn features that represent the shortcut. Hence, contrastive losses are not sufficient to learn task-optimal representations, i.e., representations that contain all task-relevant information shared between the image and associated captions. We examine two methods to reduce shortcut learning in our training and evaluation framework: (i) latent target decoding and (ii) implicit feature modification. We show empirically that both methods improve performance on the evaluation task, but only partly reduce shortcut learning when training and evaluating with our shortcut learning framework. Hence, we show the difficulty and challenge of our shortcut learning framework for contrastive vision-language representation learning.</description>

      <title>Inducing Generalization across Languages and Tasks using Featurized Low-Rank Mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adapting pretrained large language models (LLMs) to various downstream tasks in tens or hundreds of human languages is computationally expensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) significantly reduces the adaptation cost, by tuning only a small amount of parameters. However, common PEFT methods LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) suffer from suboptimal performance on diverse dataset mixtures, due to aggressive parameter tying and negative interference among different datasets. In this work, we propose Featurized Low-rank Mixtures (FLix), a novel PEFT method designed for effective multitask multilingual adaptation. FLix associates each unique dataset feature, such as the dataset's language or task, with its own low-rank weight update parameters. By composing feature-specific parameters for each dataset, FLix can accommodate diverse dataset mixtures and generalize better to unseen datasets. Our experiments show that FLix leads to significant improvements over a variety of tasks for both supervised learning and zero-shot settings with gains of up to $14.2$ inexact match points in zero-shot semantic parsing.</description>

      <title>The opportunities and risks of large language models in mental health</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global rates of mental health concerns are rising, and there is increasing realization that existing models of mental health care will not adequately expand to meet the demand. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has come great optimism regarding their promise to create novel, large-scale solutions to support mental health. Despite their nascence, LLMs have already been applied to mental health related tasks. In this paper, we summarize the extant literature on efforts to use LLMs to provide mental health education, assessment, and intervention and highlight key opportunities for positive impact in each area. We then highlight risks associated with LLMs' application to mental health and encourage the adoption of strategies to mitigate these risks. The urgent need for mental health support must be balanced with responsible development, testing, and deployment of mental health LLMs. It is especially critical to ensure that mental health LLMs are fine-tuned for mental health, enhance mental health equity, and adhere to ethical standards and that people, including those with lived experience with mental health concerns, are involved in all stages from development through deployment. Prioritizing these efforts will minimize potential harms to mental health and maximize the likelihood that LLMs will positively impact mental health globally.</description>

      <title>Navigating Fairness: Practitioners' Understanding, Challenges, and Strategies in AI/ML Development</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise in the use of AI/ML applications across industries has sparked more discussions about the fairness of AI/ML in recent times. While prior research on the fairness of AI/ML exists, there is a lack of empirical studies focused on understanding the perspectives and experiences of AI practitioners in developing a fair AI/ML system. Understanding AI practitioners' perspectives and experiences on the fairness of AI/ML systems are important because they are directly involved in its development and deployment and their insights can offer valuable real-world perspectives on the challenges associated with ensuring fairness in AI/ML systems. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 AI practitioners to investigate their understanding of what a 'fair AI/ML' is, the challenges they face in developing a fair AI/ML system, the consequences of developing an unfair AI/ML system, and the strategies they employ to ensure AI/ML system fairness. We developed a framework showcasing the relationship between AI practitioners' understanding of 'fair AI/ML' system and (i) their challenges in its development, (ii) the consequences of developing an unfair AI/ML system, and (iii) strategies used to ensure AI/ML system fairness. By exploring AI practitioners' perspectives and experiences, this study provides actionable insights to enhance AI/ML fairness, which may promote fairer systems, reduce bias, and foster public trust in AI technologies. Additionally, we also identify areas for further investigation and offer recommendations to aid AI practitioners and AI companies in navigating fairness.</description>

      <title>Modality Translation for Object Detection Adaptation Without Forgetting Prior Knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01492v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common practice in deep learning involves training large neural networks on massive datasets to achieve high accuracy across various domains and tasks. While this approach works well in many application areas, it often fails drastically when processing data from a new modality with a significant distribution shift from the data used to pre-train the model. This paper focuses on adapting a large object detection model trained on RGB images to new data extracted from IR images with a substantial modality shift. We propose Modality Translator (ModTr) as an alternative to the common approach of fine-tuning a large model to the new modality. ModTr adapts the IR input image with a small transformation network trained to directly minimize the detection loss. The original RGB model can then work on the translated inputs without any further changes or fine-tuning to its parameters. Experimental results on translating from IR to RGB images on two well-known datasets show that our simple approach provides detectors that perform comparably or better than standard fine-tuning, without forgetting the knowledge of the original model. This opens the door to a more flexible and efficient service-based detection pipeline, where a unique and unaltered server, such as an RGB detector, runs constantly while being queried by different modalities, such as IR with the corresponding translations model. Our code is available at: https://github.com/heitorrapela/ModTr.</description>

Abstract: Safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving require robust 3D environment perception algorithms capable of handling diverse and ambiguous surroundings. The predictive performance of classification models is heavily influenced by the dataset and the prior knowledge provided by the annotated labels. While labels guide the learning process, they often fail to capture the inherent relationships between classes that are naturally understood by humans. We propose a training strategy for a 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation model that learns structural relationships between classes through abstraction. This is achieved by implicitly modeling these relationships using a learning rule for hierarchical multi-label classification (HMC). Our detailed analysis demonstrates that this training strategy not only improves the model's confidence calibration but also retains additional information useful for downstream tasks such as fusion, prediction, and planning.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning via Cooperative Coevolution</title>

Abstract: Recently, evolutionary reinforcement learning has obtained much attention in various domains. Maintaining a population of actors, evolutionary reinforcement learning utilises the collected experiences to improve the behaviour policy through efficient exploration. However, the poor scalability of genetic operators limits the efficiency of optimising high-dimensional neural networks.To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel cooperative coevolutionary reinforcement learning (CoERL) algorithm. Inspired by cooperative coevolution, CoERL periodically and adaptively decomposes the policy optimisation problem into multiple subproblems and evolves a population of neural networks for each of the subproblems. Instead of using genetic operators, CoERL directly searches for partial gradients to update the policy. Updating policy with partial gradients maintains consistency between the behaviour spaces of parents and offspring across generations.The experiences collected by the population are then used to improve the entire policy, which enhances the sampling efficiency.Experiments on six benchmark locomotion tasks demonstrate that CoERL outperforms seven state-of-the-art algorithms and baselines.Ablation study verifies the unique contribution of CoERL's core ingredients.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Next Point-of-Interest Recommendation</title>

Abstract: The next Point of Interest (POI) recommendation task is to predict users' immediate next POI visit given their historical data. Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) data, which is often used for the next POI recommendation task, comes with challenges. One frequently disregarded challenge is how to effectively use the abundant contextual information present in LBSN data. Previous methods are limited by their numerical nature and fail to address this challenge. In this paper, we propose a framework that uses pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle this challenge. Our framework allows us to preserve heterogeneous LBSN data in its original format, hence avoiding the loss of contextual information. Furthermore, our framework is capable of comprehending the inherent meaning of contextual information due to the inclusion of commonsense knowledge. In experiments, we test our framework on three real-world LBSN datasets. Our results show that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models in all three datasets. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in using contextual information as well as alleviating the commonly encountered cold-start and short trajectory problems.</description>

      <title>Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning for ultrasound navigation guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) plays a pivotal role in cardiology for diagnostic and interventional procedures. However, using it effectively requires extensive training due to the intricate nature of image acquisition and interpretation. To enhance the efficiency of novice sonographers and reduce variability in scan acquisitions, we propose a novel ultrasound (US) navigation assistance method based on contrastive learning as goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL). We augment the previous framework using a novel contrastive patient batching method (CPB) and a data-augmented contrastive loss, both of which we demonstrate are essential to ensure generalization to anatomical variations across patients. The proposed framework enables navigation to both standard diagnostic as well as intricate interventional views with a single model. Our method was developed with a large dataset of 789 patients and obtained an average error of 6.56 mm in position and 9.36 degrees in angle on a testing dataset of 140 patients, which is competitive or superior to models trained on individual views. Furthermore, we quantitatively validate our method's ability to navigate to interventional views such as the Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) view used in LAA closure. Our approach holds promise in providing valuable guidance during transesophageal ultrasound examinations, contributing to the advancement of skill acquisition for cardiac ultrasound practitioners.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-Empowered Task Assignment in Aerial MEC Network: A Resource Coalition Cooperation Approach with Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To meet the demands for ubiquitous communication and temporary edge computing in 6G networks, aerial mobile edge computing (MEC) networks have been envisioned as a new paradigm. However, dynamic user requests pose challenges for task assignment strategies. Most of the existing research assumes that the strategy is deployed on ground-based stations or UAVs, which will be ineffective in an environment lacking infrastructure and continuous energy supply. Moreover, the resource mutual exclusion problem of dynamic task assignment has not been effectively solved. Toward this end, we introduce the digital twin (DT) into the aerial MEC network to study the resource coalition cooperation approach with the generative model (GM), which provides a preliminary coalition structure for the coalition game. Specifically, we propose a novel network framework that is composed of an application plane, a physical plane, and a virtual plane. After that, the task assignment problem is simplified to convex optimization programming with linear constraints. And then, we also propose a resource coalition cooperation approach that is based on a transferable utility (TU) coalition game to obtain an approximate optimal solution. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach in terms of energy consumption and utilization of resources.</description>

Abstract: We present SSL-HV: Self-Supervised Learning approaches applied to the task of Handwriting Verification. This task involves determining whether a given pair of handwritten images originate from the same or different writer distribution. We have compared the performance of multiple generative, contrastive SSL approaches against handcrafted feature extractors and supervised learning on CEDAR AND dataset. We show that ResNet based Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) outperforms other generative approaches achieving 76.3% accuracy, while ResNet-18 fine-tuned using Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization (VICReg) outperforms other contrastive approaches achieving 78% accuracy. Using a pre-trained VAE and VICReg for the downstream task of writer verification we observed a relative improvement in accuracy of 6.7% and 9% over ResNet-18 supervised baseline with 10% writer labels.</description>

      <title>An AI-Enabled Framework Within Reach for Enhancing Healthcare Sustainability and Fairness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Good health and well-being is among key issues in the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. The rising prevalence of large-scale infectious diseases and the accelerated aging of the global population are driving the transformation of healthcare technologies. In this context, establishing large-scale public health datasets, developing medical models, and creating decision-making systems with a human-centric approach are of strategic significance. Recently, by leveraging the extraordinary number of accessible cameras, groundbreaking advancements have emerged in AI methods for physiological signal monitoring and disease diagnosis using camera sensors. These approaches, requiring no specialized medical equipment, offer convenient manners of collecting large-scale medical data in response to public health events. Therefore, we outline a prospective framework and heuristic vision for a camera-based public health (CBPH) framework utilizing visual physiological monitoring technology. The CBPH can be considered as a convenient and universal framework for public health, advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, particularly in promoting the universality, sustainability, and equity of healthcare in low- and middle-income countries or regions. Furthermore, CBPH provides a comprehensive solution for building a large-scale and human-centric medical database, and a multi-task large medical model for public health and medical scientific discoveries. It has a significant potential to revolutionize personal monitoring technologies, digital medicine, telemedicine, and primary health care in public health. Therefore, it can be deemed that the outcomes of this paper will contribute to the establishment of a sustainable and fair framework for public health, which serves as a crucial bridge for advancing scientific discoveries in the realm of AI for medicine (AI4Medicine).</description>

      <title>The Impact of Quantization on Retrieval-Augmented Generation: An Analysis of Small LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-training quantization reduces the computational demand of Large Language Models (LLMs) but can weaken some of their capabilities. Since LLM abilities emerge with scale, smaller LLMs are more sensitive to quantization. In this paper, we explore how quantization affects smaller LLMs' ability to perform retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), specifically in longer contexts. We chose personalization for evaluation because it is a challenging domain to perform using RAG as it requires long-context reasoning over multiple documents. We compare the original FP16 and the quantized INT4 performance of multiple 7B and 8B LLMs on two tasks while progressively increasing the number of retrieved documents to test how quantized models fare against longer contexts. To better understand the effect of retrieval, we evaluate three retrieval models in our experiments. Our findings reveal that if a 7B LLM performs the task well, quantization does not impair its performance and long-context reasoning capabilities. We conclude that it is possible to utilize RAG with quantized smaller LLMs.</description>

      <title>GLiNER multi-task: Generalist Lightweight Model for Various Information Extraction Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information extraction tasks require both accurate, efficient, and generalisable models. Classical supervised deep learning approaches can achieve the required performance, but they need large datasets and are limited in their ability to adapt to different tasks. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate good generalization, meaning that they can adapt to many different tasks based on user requests. However, LLMs are computationally expensive and tend to fail to generate structured outputs. In this article, we will introduce a new kind of GLiNER model that can be used for various information extraction tasks while being a small encoder model. Our model achieved SoTA performance on zero-shot NER benchmarks and leading performance on question-answering, summarization and relation extraction tasks. Additionally, in this article, we will cover experimental results on self-learning approaches for named entity recognition using GLiNER models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training extremely large language models with billions of parameters is a computationally intensive task that pushes the limits of current data parallel training systems. While techniques like ZeRO++ have enabled efficient distributed training of such giant models on inexpensive low-bandwidth clusters, they can suffer from convergence issues due to potential race conditions in the hierarchical partitioning (hpZ) scheme employed to reduce cross-machine communication. In this work, we first show how these race conditions cause instability when training models with billions of parameters. We then propose a modification to the partitioning algorithm that addresses these convergence challenges while maintaining competitive training efficiency. Empirical evaluation on training the multi-billion parameters Falcon Models and Llama-2 models demonstrates the updated algorithm's ability to achieve reliable convergence on these massive models, where stock ZeRO++ hpZ fails to converge. The updated algorithm enables robust training of larger models with 98\% throughput and model training speed improvement without sacrificing the quality of convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-powered tools like ChatGPT Data Analysis, have the potential to help users tackle the challenging task of data analysis programming, which requires expertise in data processing, programming, and statistics. However, our formative study (n=15) uncovered serious challenges in verifying AI-generated results and steering the AI (i.e., guiding the AI system to produce the desired output). We developed two contrasting approaches to address these challenges. The first (Stepwise) decomposes the problem into step-by-step subgoals with pairs of editable assumptions and code until task completion, while the second (Phasewise) decomposes the entire problem into three editable, logical phases: structured input/output assumptions, execution plan, and code. A controlled, within-subjects experiment (n=18) compared these systems against a conversational baseline. Users reported significantly greater control with the Stepwise and Phasewise systems, and found intervention, correction, and verification easier, compared to the baseline. The results suggest design guidelines and trade-offs for AI-assisted data analysis tools.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Health Technology Assessment: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Considerations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review introduces the transformative potential of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and foundation models, including large language models (LLMs), for health technology assessment (HTA). We explore their applications in four critical areas, evidence synthesis, evidence generation, clinical trials and economic modeling: (1) Evidence synthesis: Generative AI has the potential to assist in automating literature reviews and meta-analyses by proposing search terms, screening abstracts, and extracting data with notable accuracy; (2) Evidence generation: These models can potentially facilitate automating the process and analyze the increasingly available large collections of real-world data (RWD), including unstructured clinical notes and imaging, enhancing the speed and quality of real-world evidence (RWE) generation; (3) Clinical trials: Generative AI can be used to optimize trial design, improve patient matching, and manage trial data more efficiently; and (4) Economic modeling: Generative AI can also aid in the development of health economic models, from conceptualization to validation, thus streamlining the overall HTA process. Despite their promise, these technologies, while rapidly improving, are still nascent and continued careful evaluation in their applications to HTA is required. To ensure their responsible use and implementation, both developers and users of research incorporating these tools, should familiarize themselves with their current limitations, including the issues related to scientific validity, risk of bias, and consider equity and ethical implications. We also surveyed the current policy landscape and provide suggestions for HTA agencies on responsibly integrating generative AI into their workflows, emphasizing the importance of human oversight and the fast-evolving nature of these tools.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamiltonian Embedding of Images for Data Reuploading Classifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When applying quantum computing to machine learning tasks, one of the first considerations is the design of the quantum machine learning model itself. Conventionally, the design of quantum machine learning algorithms relies on the ``quantisation" of classical learning algorithms, such as using quantum linear algebra to implement important subroutines of classical algorithms, if not the entire algorithm, seeking to achieve quantum advantage through possible run-time accelerations brought by quantum computing. However, recent research has started questioning whether quantum advantage via speedup is the right goal for quantum machine learning [1]. Research also has been undertaken to exploit properties that are unique to quantum systems, such as quantum contextuality, to better design quantum machine learning models [2]. In this paper, we take an alternative approach by incorporating the heuristics and empirical evidences from the design of classical deep learning algorithms to the design of quantum neural networks. We first construct a model based on the data reuploading circuit [3] with the quantum Hamiltonian data embedding unitary [4]. Through numerical experiments on images datasets, including the famous MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms the quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN)[5] by a large margin (up to over 40% on MNIST test set). Based on the model design process and numerical results, we then laid out six principles for designing quantum machine learning models, especially quantum neural networks.</description>

      <title>Towards Assessing Data Replication in Music Generation with Music Similarity Metrics on Raw Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in music generation are raising multiple concerns about the implications of AI in creative music processes, current business models and impacts related to intellectual property management. A relevant discussion and related technical challenge is the potential replication and plagiarism of the training set in AI-generated music, which could lead to misuse of data and intellectual property rights violations. To tackle this issue, we present the Music Replication Assessment (MiRA) tool: a model-independent open evaluation method based on diverse audio music similarity metrics to assess data replication. We evaluate the ability of five metrics to identify exact replication by conducting a controlled replication experiment in different music genres using synthetic samples. Our results show that the proposed methodology can estimate exact data replication with a proportion higher than 10%. By introducing the MiRA tool, we intend to encourage the open evaluation of music-generative models by researchers, developers, and users concerning data replication, highlighting the importance of the ethical, social, legal, and economic consequences. Code and examples are available for reproducibility purposes.</description>

      <title>On Pre-training of Multimodal Language Models Customized for Chart Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies customizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for domain-specific tasks have yielded promising results, especially in the field of scientific chart comprehension. These studies generally utilize visual instruction tuning with specialized datasets to enhance question and answer (QA) accuracy within the chart domain. However, they often neglect the fundamental discrepancy between natural image-caption pre-training data and digital chart image-QA data, particularly in the models' capacity to extract underlying numeric values from charts. This paper tackles this oversight by exploring the training processes necessary to improve MLLMs' comprehension of charts. We present three key findings: (1) Incorporating raw data values in alignment pre-training markedly improves comprehension of chart data. (2) Replacing images with their textual representation randomly during end-to-end fine-tuning transfer the language reasoning capability to chart interpretation skills. (3) Requiring the model to first extract the underlying chart data and then answer the question in the fine-tuning can further improve the accuracy. Consequently, we introduce CHOPINLLM, an MLLM tailored for in-depth chart comprehension. CHOPINLLM effectively interprets various types of charts, including unannotated ones, while maintaining robust reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we establish a new benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of different chart types across various comprehension levels. Experimental results show that CHOPINLLM exhibits strong performance in understanding both annotated and unannotated charts across a wide range of types.</description>

      <title>A Nested Model for AI Design and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing AI field faces trust, transparency, fairness, and discrimination challenges. Despite the need for new regulations, there is a mismatch between regulatory science and AI, preventing a consistent framework. A five-layer nested model for AI design and validation aims to address these issues and streamline AI application design and validation, improving fairness, trust, and AI adoption. This model aligns with regulations, addresses AI practitioner's daily challenges, and offers prescriptive guidance for determining appropriate evaluation approaches by identifying unique validity threats. We have three recommendations motivated by this model: authors should distinguish between layers when claiming contributions to clarify the specific areas in which the contribution is made and to avoid confusion, authors should explicitly state upstream assumptions to ensure that the context and limitations of their AI system are clearly understood, AI venues should promote thorough testing and validation of AI systems and their compliance with regulatory requirements.</description>

      <title>HG-PIPE: Vision Transformer Acceleration with Hybrid-Grained Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) acceleration with field programmable gate array (FPGA) is promising but challenging. Existing FPGA-based ViT accelerators mainly rely on temporal architectures, which process different operators by reusing the same hardware blocks and suffer from extensive memory access overhead. Pipelined architectures, either coarse-grained or fine-grained, unroll the ViT computation spatially for memory access efficiency. However, they usually suffer from significant hardware resource constraints and pipeline bubbles induced by the global computation dependency of ViT. In this paper, we introduce HG-PIPE, a pipelined FPGA accelerator for high-throughput and low-latency ViT processing. HG-PIPE features a hybrid-grained pipeline architecture to reduce on-chip buffer cost and couples the computation dataflow and parallelism design to eliminate the pipeline bubbles. HG-PIPE further introduces careful approximations to implement both linear and non-linear operators with abundant Lookup Tables (LUTs), thus alleviating resource constraints. On a ZCU102 FPGA, HG-PIPE achieves 2.78 times better throughput and 2.52 times better resource efficiency than the prior-art accelerators, e.g., AutoViTAcc. With a VCK190 FPGA, HG-PIPE realizes end-to-end ViT acceleration on a single device and achieves 7118 images/s, which is 2.81 times faster than a V100 GPU.</description>

      <title>CogNarr Ecosystem: Facilitating Group Cognition at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human groups of all sizes and kinds engage in deliberation, problem solving, strategizing, decision making, and more generally, cognition. Some groups are large, and that setting presents unique challenges. The small-group setting often involves face-to-face dialogue, but group cognition in the large-group setting typically requires some form of online interaction. New approaches are needed to facilitate the kind of rich communication and information processing that are required for effective, functional cognition in the online setting, especially for groups characterized by thousands to millions of participants who wish to share potentially complex, nuanced, and dynamic perspectives. This concept paper proposes the CogNarr (Cognitive Narrative) ecosystem, which is designed to facilitate functional cognition in the large-group setting. The paper's contribution is a novel vision as to how recent developments in cognitive science, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and related fields might be scaled and applied to large-group cognition, using an approach that itself promotes further scientific advancement. A key perspective is to view a group as an organism that uses some form of cognitive architecture to sense the world, process information, remember, learn, predict, make decisions, and adapt to changing conditions. The CogNarr ecosystem is designed to serve as a component within that architecture.</description>

      <title>MimiQ: Low-Bit Data-Free Quantization of Vision Transformers with Encouraging Inter-Head Attention Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-free quantization (DFQ) is a technique that creates a lightweight network from its full-precision counterpart without the original training data, often through a synthetic dataset. Although several DFQ methods have been proposed for vision transformer (ViT) architectures, they fail to achieve efficacy in low-bit settings. Examining the existing methods, we identify that their synthetic data produce misaligned attention maps, while those of the real samples are highly aligned. From the observation of aligned attention, we find that aligning attention maps of synthetic data helps to improve the overall performance of quantized ViTs. Motivated by this finding, we devise MimiQ, a novel DFQ method designed for ViTs that focuses on inter-head attention similarity. First, we generate synthetic data by aligning head-wise attention responses in relation to spatial query patches. Then, we apply head-wise structural attention distillation to align the attention maps of the quantized network to those of the full-precision teacher. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art performance for data-free ViT quantization.</description>

      <title>Dataset Distillation for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning often requires a quality dataset that we can train a policy on. However, in many situations, it is not possible to get such a dataset, nor is it easy to train a policy to perform well in the actual environment given the offline data. We propose using data distillation to train and distill a better dataset which can then be used for training a better policy model. We show that our method is able to synthesize a dataset where a model trained on it achieves similar performance to a model trained on the full dataset or a model trained using percentile behavioral cloning. Our project site is available at $\href{https://datasetdistillation4rl.github.io}{\text{here}}$. We also provide our implementation at $\href{https://github.com/ggflow123/DDRL}{\text{this GitHub repository}}$.</description>

      <title>Beyond Silent Letters: Amplifying LLMs in Emotion Recognition with Vocal Nuances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to emotion detection in speech using Large Language Models (LLMs). We address the limitation of LLMs in processing audio inputs by translating speech characteristics into natural language descriptions. Our method integrates these descriptions into text prompts, enabling LLMs to perform multimodal emotion analysis without architectural modifications. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: IEMOCAP and MELD, demonstrating significant improvements in emotion recognition accuracy, particularly for high-quality audio data. Our experiments show that incorporating speech descriptions yields a 2 percentage point increase in weighted F1 score on IEMOCAP (from 70.111\% to 72.596\%). We also compare various LLM architectures and explore the effectiveness of different feature representations. Our findings highlight the potential of this approach in enhancing emotion detection capabilities of LLMs and underscore the importance of audio quality in speech-based emotion recognition tasks. We'll release the source code on Github.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Factor Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Factor analysis, often regarded as a Bayesian variant of matrix factorization, offers superior capabilities in capturing uncertainty, modeling complex dependencies, and ensuring robustness. As the deep learning era arrives, factor analysis is receiving less and less attention due to their limited expressive ability. On the contrary, contrastive learning has emerged as a potent technique with demonstrated efficacy in unsupervised representational learning. While the two methods are different paradigms, recent theoretical analysis has revealed the mathematical equivalence between contrastive learning and matrix factorization, providing a potential possibility for factor analysis combined with contrastive learning. Motivated by the interconnectedness of contrastive learning, matrix factorization, and factor analysis, this paper introduces a novel Contrastive Factor Analysis framework, aiming to leverage factor analysis's advantageous properties within the realm of contrastive learning. To further leverage the interpretability properties of non-negative factor analysis, which can learn disentangled representations, contrastive factor analysis is extended to a non-negative version. Finally, extensive experimental validation showcases the efficacy of the proposed contrastive (non-negative) factor analysis methodology across multiple key properties, including expressiveness, robustness, interpretability, and accurate uncertainty estimation.</description>
