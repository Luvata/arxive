      <title>UnityGraph: Unified Learning of Spatio-temporal features for Multi-person Motion Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-person motion prediction is a complex and emerging field with significant real-world applications. Current state-of-the-art methods typically adopt dual-path networks to separately modeling spatial features and temporal features. However, the uncertain compatibility of the two networks brings a challenge for spatio-temporal features fusion and violate the spatio-temporal coherence and coupling of human motions by nature. To address this issue, we propose a novel graph structure, UnityGraph, which treats spatio-temporal features as a whole, enhancing model coherence and coupling.spatio-temporal features as a whole, enhancing model coherence and coupling. Specifically, UnityGraph is a hypervariate graph based network. The flexibility of the hypergraph allows us to consider the observed motions as graph nodes. We then leverage hyperedges to bridge these nodes for exploring spatio-temporal features. This perspective considers spatio-temporal dynamics unitedly and reformulates multi-person motion prediction into a problem on a single graph. Leveraging the dynamic message passing based on this hypergraph, our model dynamically learns from both types of relations to generate targeted messages that reflect the relevance among nodes. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming its effectiveness and innovative design.</description>

      <title>DiMSUM: Diffusion Mamba -- A Scalable and Unified Spatial-Frequency Method for Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel state-space architecture for diffusion models, effectively harnessing spatial and frequency information to enhance the inductive bias towards local features in input images for image generation tasks. While state-space networks, including Mamba, a revolutionary advancement in recurrent neural networks, typically scan input sequences from left to right, they face difficulties in designing effective scanning strategies, especially in the processing of image data. Our method demonstrates that integrating wavelet transformation into Mamba enhances the local structure awareness of visual inputs and better captures long-range relations of frequencies by disentangling them into wavelet subbands, representing both low- and high-frequency components. These wavelet-based outputs are then processed and seamlessly fused with the original Mamba outputs through a cross-attention fusion layer, combining both spatial and frequency information to optimize the order awareness of state-space models which is essential for the details and overall quality of image generation. Besides, we introduce a globally-shared transformer to supercharge the performance of Mamba, harnessing its exceptional power to capture global relationships. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, our method demonstrates superior results compared to DiT and DIFFUSSM, achieving faster training convergence and delivering high-quality outputs. The codes and pretrained models are released at https://github.com/VinAIResearch/DiMSUM.git.</description>

      <title>WiFlexFormer: Efficient WiFi-Based Person-Centric Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose WiFlexFormer, a highly efficient Transformer-based architecture designed for WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based person-centric sensing. We benchmark WiFlexFormer against state-of-the-art vision and specialized architectures for processing radio frequency data and demonstrate that it achieves comparable Human Activity Recognition (HAR) performance while offering a significantly lower parameter count and faster inference times. With an inference time of just 10 ms on an Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano, WiFlexFormer is optimized for real-time inference. Additionally, its low parameter count contributes to improved cross-domain generalization, where it often outperforms larger models. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that WiFlexFormer is a potential solution for efficient, scalable WiFi-based sensing applications. The PyTorch implementation of WiFlexFormer is publicly available at: https://github.com/StrohmayerJ/WiFlexFormer.</description>

      <title>PMPNet: Pixel Movement Prediction Network for Monocular Depth Estimation in Dynamic Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method for monocular depth estimation in dynamic scenes. We first explore the arbitrariness of object's movement trajectory in dynamic scenes theoretically. To overcome the arbitrariness, we use assume that points move along a straight line over short distances and then summarize it as a triangular constraint loss in two dimensional Euclidean space. To overcome the depth inconsistency problem around the edges, we propose a deformable support window module that learns features from different shapes of objects, making depth value more accurate around edge area. The proposed model is trained and tested on two outdoor datasets - KITTI and Make3D, as well as an indoor dataset - NYU Depth V2. The quantitative and qualitative results reported on these datasets demonstrate the success of our proposed model when compared against other approaches. Ablation study results on the KITTI dataset also validate the effectiveness of the proposed pixel movement prediction module as well as the deformable support window module.</description>

      <title>PocoLoco: A Point Cloud Diffusion Model of Human Shape in Loose Clothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling a human avatar that can plausibly deform to articulations is an active area of research. We present PocoLoco -- the first template-free, point-based, pose-conditioned generative model for 3D humans in loose clothing. We motivate our work by noting that most methods require a parametric model of the human body to ground pose-dependent deformations. Consequently, they are restricted to modeling clothing that is topologically similar to the naked body and do not extend well to loose clothing. The few methods that attempt to model loose clothing typically require either canonicalization or a UV-parameterization and need to address the challenging problem of explicitly estimating correspondences for the deforming clothes. In this work, we formulate avatar clothing deformation as a conditional point-cloud generation task within the denoising diffusion framework. Crucially, our framework operates directly on unordered point clouds, eliminating the need for a parametric model or a clothing template. This also enables a variety of practical applications, such as point-cloud completion and pose-based editing -- important features for virtual human animation. As current datasets for human avatars in loose clothing are far too small for training diffusion models, we release a dataset of two subjects performing various poses in loose clothing with a total of 75K point clouds. By contributing towards tackling the challenging task of effectively modeling loose clothing and expanding the available data for training these models, we aim to set the stage for further innovation in digital humans.

      <title>Pose-Transformation and Radial Distance Clustering for Unsupervised Person Re-identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Person re-identification (re-ID) aims to tackle the problem of matching identities across non-overlapping cameras. Supervised approaches require identity information that may be difficult to obtain and are inherently biased towards the dataset they are trained on, making them unscalable across domains. To overcome these challenges, we propose an unsupervised approach to the person re-ID setup. Having zero knowledge of true labels, our proposed method enhances the discriminating ability of the learned features via a novel two-stage training strategy. The first stage involves training a deep network on an expertly designed pose-transformed dataset obtained by generating multiple perturbations for each original image in the pose space. Next, the network learns to map similar features closer in the feature space using the proposed discriminative clustering algorithm. We introduce a novel radial distance loss, that attends to the fundamental aspects of feature learning - compact clusters with low intra-cluster and high inter-cluster variation. Extensive experiments on several large-scale re-ID datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Increasing the scalability of graph convolution for FPGA-implemented event-based vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras are becoming increasingly popular as an alternative to traditional frame-based vision sensors, especially in mobile robotics. Taking full advantage of their high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, low power consumption and sparsity of event data, which only reflects changes in the observed scene, requires both an efficient algorithm and a specialised hardware platform. A recent trend involves using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs) implemented on a heterogeneous SoC FPGA. In this paper we focus on optimising hardware modules for graph convolution to allow flexible selection of the FPGA resource (BlockRAM, DSP and LUT) for their implementation. We propose a ''two-step convolution'' approach that utilises additional BRAM buffers in order to reduce up to 94% of LUT usage for multiplications. This method significantly improves the scalability of GCNNs, enabling the deployment of models with more layers, larger graphs sizes and their application for more dynamic scenarios.</description>

      <title>HandCraft: Anatomically Correct Restoration of Malformed Hands in Diffusion Generated Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated a remarkable ability to generate diverse, high-quality images. However, they are surprisingly inept when it comes to rendering human hands, which are often anatomically incorrect or reside in the "uncanny valley". In this paper, we propose a method HandCraft for restoring such malformed hands. This is achieved by automatically constructing masks and depth images for hands as conditioning signals using a parametric model, allowing a diffusion-based image editor to fix the hand's anatomy and adjust its pose while seamlessly integrating the changes into the original image, preserving pose, color, and style. Our plug-and-play hand restoration solution is compatible with existing pretrained diffusion models, and the restoration process facilitates adoption by eschewing any fine-tuning or training requirements for the diffusion models. We also contribute MalHand datasets that contain generated images with a wide variety of malformed hands in several styles for hand detector training and hand restoration benchmarking, and demonstrate through qualitative and quantitative evaluation that HandCraft not only restores anatomical correctness but also maintains the integrity of the overall image.</description>

      <title>GazeGen: Gaze-Driven User Interaction for Visual Content Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GazeGen, a user interaction system that generates visual content (images and videos) for locations indicated by the user's eye gaze. GazeGen allows intuitive manipulation of visual content by targeting regions of interest with gaze. Using advanced techniques in object detection and generative AI, GazeGen performs gaze-controlled image adding/deleting, repositioning, and surface material changes of image objects, and converts static images into videos. Central to GazeGen is the DFT Gaze (Distilled and Fine-Tuned Gaze) agent, an ultra-lightweight model with only 281K parameters, performing accurate real-time gaze predictions tailored to individual users' eyes on small edge devices. GazeGen is the first system to combine visual content generation with real-time gaze estimation, made possible exclusively by DFT Gaze. This real-time gaze estimation enables various visual content generation tasks, all controlled by the user's gaze. The input for DFT Gaze is the user's eye images, while the inputs for visual content generation are the user's view and the predicted gaze point from DFT Gaze. To achieve efficient gaze predictions, we derive the small model from a large model (10x larger) via novel knowledge distillation and personal adaptation techniques. We integrate knowledge distillation with a masked autoencoder, developing a compact yet powerful gaze estimation model. This model is further fine-tuned with Adapters, enabling highly accurate and personalized gaze predictions with minimal user input. DFT Gaze ensures low-latency and precise gaze tracking, supporting a wide range of gaze-driven tasks. We validate the performance of DFT Gaze on AEA and OpenEDS2020 benchmarks, demonstrating low angular gaze error and low latency on the edge device (Raspberry Pi 4). Furthermore, we describe applications of GazeGen, illustrating its versatility and effectiveness in various usage scenarios.</description>

      <title>UEVAVD: A Dataset for Developing UAV's Eye View Active Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Occlusion is a longstanding difficulty that challenges the UAV-based object detection. Many works address this problem by adapting the detection model. However, few of them exploit that the UAV could fundamentally improve detection performance by changing its viewpoint. Active Object Detection (AOD) offers an effective way to achieve this purpose. Through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), AOD endows the UAV with the ability of autonomous path planning to search for the observation that is more conducive to target identification. Unfortunately, there exists no available dataset for developing the UAV AOD method. To fill this gap, we released a UAV's eye view active vision dataset named UEVAVD and hope it can facilitate research on the UAV AOD problem. Additionally, we improve the existing DRL-based AOD method by incorporating the inductive bias when learning the state representation. First, due to the partial observability, we use the gated recurrent unit to extract state representations from the observation sequence instead of the single-view observation. Second, we pre-decompose the scene with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and filter out the irrelevant information with the derived masks. With these practices, the agent could learn an active viewing policy with better generalization capability. The effectiveness of our innovations is validated by the experiments on the UEVAVD dataset. Our dataset will soon be available at https://github.com/Leo000ooo/UEVAVD_dataset.</description>

      <title>LidaRefer: Outdoor 3D Visual Grounding for Autonomous Driving with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D visual grounding (VG) aims to locate relevant objects or regions within 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions. Although recent methods for indoor 3D VG have successfully transformer-based architectures to capture global contextual information and enable fine-grained cross-modal fusion, they are unsuitable for outdoor environments due to differences in the distribution of point clouds between indoor and outdoor settings. Specifically, first, extensive LiDAR point clouds demand unacceptable computational and memory resources within transformers due to the high-dimensional visual features. Second, dominant background points and empty spaces in sparse LiDAR point clouds complicate cross-modal fusion owing to their irrelevant visual information. To address these challenges, we propose LidaRefer, a transformer-based 3D VG framework designed for large-scale outdoor scenes. Moreover, during training, we introduce a simple and effective localization method, which supervises the decoder's queries to localize not only a target object but also ambiguous objects that might be confused as the target due to the exhibition of similar attributes in a scene or the incorrect understanding of a language description. This supervision enhances the model's ability to distinguish ambiguous objects from a target by learning the differences in their spatial relationships and attributes. LidaRefer achieves state-of-the-art performance on Talk2Car-3D, a 3D VG dataset for autonomous driving, with significant improvements under various evaluation settings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose MegaPortrait. It's an innovative system for creating personalized portrait images in computer vision. It has three modules: Identity Net, Shading Net, and Harmonization Net. Identity Net generates learned identity using a customized model fine-tuned with source images. Shading Net re-renders portraits using extracted representations. Harmonization Net fuses pasted faces and the reference image's body for coherent results. Our approach with off-the-shelf Controlnets is better than state-of-the-art AI portrait products in identity preservation and image fidelity. MegaPortrait has a simple but effective design and we compare it with other methods and products to show its superiority.</description>

      <title>ProGraph: Temporally-alignable Probability Guided Graph Topological Modeling for 3D Human Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current 3D human motion reconstruction methods from monocular videos rely on features within the current reconstruction window, leading to distortion and deformations in the human structure under local occlusions or blurriness in video frames. To estimate realistic 3D human mesh sequences based on incomplete features, we propose Temporally-alignable Probability Guided Graph Topological Modeling for 3D Human Reconstruction (ProGraph). For missing parts recovery, we exploit the explicit topological-aware probability distribution across the entire motion sequence. To restore the complete human, Graph Topological Modeling (GTM) learns the underlying topological structure, focusing on the relationships inherent in the individual parts. Next, to generate blurred motion parts, Temporal-alignable Probability Distribution (TPDist) utilizes the GTM to predict features based on distribution. This interactive mechanism facilitates motion consistency, allowing the restoration of human parts. Furthermore, Hierarchical Human Loss (HHLoss) constrains the probability distribution errors of inter-frame features during topological structure variation. Our Method achieves superior results than other SOTA methods in addressing occlusions and blurriness on 3DPW.</description>

      <title>Image Understanding Makes for A Good Tokenizer for Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstract Modern image generation (IG) models have been shown to capture rich semantics valuable for image understanding (IU) tasks. However, the potential of IU models to improve IG performance remains uncharted. We address this issue using a token-based IG framework, which relies on effective tokenizers to project images into token sequences. Currently, pixel reconstruction (e.g., VQGAN) dominates the training objective for image tokenizers. In contrast, our approach adopts the feature reconstruction objective, where tokenizers are trained by distilling knowledge from pretrained IU encoders. Comprehensive comparisons indicate that tokenizers with strong IU capabilities achieve superior IG performance across a variety of metrics, datasets, tasks, and proposal networks. Notably, VQ-KD CLIP achieves $4.10$ FID on ImageNet-1k (IN-1k). Visualization suggests that the superiority of VQ-KD can be partly attributed to the rich semantics within the VQ-KD codebook. We further introduce a straightforward pipeline to directly transform IU encoders into tokenizers, demonstrating exceptional effectiveness for IG tasks. These discoveries may energize further exploration into image tokenizer research and inspire the community to reassess the relationship between IU and IG. The code is released at https://github.com/magic-research/vector_quantization.</description>

      <title>BendVLM: Test-Time Debiasing of Vision-Language Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) embeddings have been shown to encode biases present in their training data, such as societal biases that prescribe negative characteristics to members of various racial and gender identities. VLMs are being quickly adopted for a variety of tasks ranging from few-shot classification to text-guided image generation, making debiasing VLM embeddings crucial. Debiasing approaches that fine-tune the VLM often suffer from catastrophic forgetting. On the other hand, fine-tuning-free methods typically utilize a "one-size-fits-all" approach that assumes that correlation with the spurious attribute can be explained using a single linear direction across all possible inputs. In this work, we propose Bend-VLM, a nonlinear, fine-tuning-free approach for VLM embedding debiasing that tailors the debiasing operation to each unique input. This allows for a more flexible debiasing approach. Additionally, we do not require knowledge of the set of inputs a priori to inference time, making our method more appropriate for online, open-set tasks such as retrieval and text guided image generation.</description>

      <title>Efficient single image non-uniformity correction algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new way to correct the non-uniformity (NU) in uncooled infrared-type images. The main defect of these uncooled images is the lack of a column (resp. line) time-dependent cross-calibration, resulting in a strong column (resp. line) and time dependent noise. This problem can be considered as a 1D flicker of the columns inside each frame. Thus, classic movie deflickering algorithms can be adapted, to equalize the columns (resp. the lines). The proposed method therefore applies to the series formed by the columns of an infrared image a movie deflickering algorithm. The obtained single image method works on static images, and therefore requires no registration, no camera motion compensation, and no closed aperture sensor equalization. Thus, the method has only one camera dependent parameter, and is landscape independent. This simple method will be compared to a state of the art total variation single image correction on raw real and simulated images. The method is real time, requiring only two operations per pixel. It involves no test-pattern calibration and produces no "ghost artifacts".</description>

      <title>FreeCap: Hybrid Calibration-Free Motion Capture in Open Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel hybrid calibration-free method FreeCap to accurately capture global multi-person motions in open environments. Our system combines a single LiDAR with expandable moving cameras, allowing for flexible and precise motion estimation in a unified world coordinate. In particular, We introduce a local-to-global pose-aware cross-sensor human-matching module that predicts the alignment among each sensor, even in the absence of calibration. Additionally, our coarse-to-fine sensor-expandable pose optimizer further optimizes the 3D human key points and the alignments, it is also capable of incorporating additional cameras to enhance accuracy. Extensive experiments on Human-M3 and FreeMotion datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art single-modal methods, offering an expandable and efficient solution for multi-person motion capture across various applications.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Models for UAV-Assisted Bridge Inspection: A YOLO Benchmark Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual inspections of bridges are critical to ensure their safety and identify potential failures early. This inspection process can be rapidly and accurately automated by using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) integrated with deep learning models. However, choosing an appropriate model that is lightweight enough to integrate into the UAV and fulfills the strict requirements for inference time and accuracy is challenging. Therefore, our work contributes to the advancement of this model selection process by conducting a benchmark of 23 models belonging to the four newest YOLO variants (YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, YOLOv8) on COCO-Bridge-2021+, a dataset for bridge details detection. Through comprehensive benchmarking, we identify YOLOv8n, YOLOv7tiny, YOLOv6m, and YOLOv6m6 as the models offering an optimal balance between accuracy and processing speed, with mAP@50 scores of 0.803, 0.837, 0.853, and 0.872, and inference times of 5.3ms, 7.5ms, 14.06ms, and 39.33ms, respectively. Our findings accelerate the model selection process for UAVs, enabling more efficient and reliable bridge inspections.</description>

      <title>CFPNet: Improving Lightweight ToF Depth Completion via Cross-zone Feature Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depth completion using lightweight time-of-flight (ToF) depth sensors is attractive due to their low cost. However, lightweight ToF sensors usually have a limited field of view (FOV) compared with cameras. Thus, only pixels in the zone area of the image can be associated with depth signals. Previous methods fail to propagate depth features from the zone area to the outside-zone area effectively, thus suffering from degraded depth completion performance outside the zone. To this end, this paper proposes the CFPNet to achieve cross-zone feature propagation from the zone area to the outside-zone area with two novel modules. The first is a direct-attention-based propagation module (DAPM), which enforces direct cross-zone feature acquisition. The second is a large-kernel-based propagation module (LKPM), which realizes cross-zone feature propagation by utilizing convolution layers with kernel sizes up to 31. CFPNet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) depth completion performance by combining these two modules properly, as verified by extensive experimental results on the ZJU-L5 dataset. The code will be made public.</description>

      <title>Synergy-Guided Regional Supervision of Pseudo Labels for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has received considerable attention for its potential to leverage abundant unlabeled data to enhance model robustness. Pseudo labeling is a widely used strategy in semi supervised learning. However, existing methods often suffer from noise contamination, which can undermine model performance. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel Synergy-Guided Regional Supervision of Pseudo Labels (SGRS-Net) framework. Built upon the mean teacher network, we employ a Mix Augmentation module to enhance the unlabeled data. By evaluating the synergy before and after augmentation, we strategically partition the pseudo labels into distinct regions. Additionally, we introduce a Region Loss Evaluation module to assess the loss across each delineated area. Extensive experiments conducted on the LA dataset have demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art techniques, underscoring the efficiency and practicality of our framework.</description>

      <title>Pose2Trajectory: Using Transformers on Body Pose to Predict Tennis Player's Trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking the trajectory of tennis players can help camera operators in production. Predicting future movement enables cameras to automatically track and predict a player's future trajectory without human intervention. Predicting future human movement in the context of complex physical tasks is also intellectually satisfying. Swift advancements in sports analytics and the wide availability of videos for tennis have inspired us to propose a novel method called Pose2Trajectory, which predicts a tennis player's future trajectory as a sequence derived from their body joints' data and ball position. Demonstrating impressive accuracy, our approach capitalizes on body joint information to provide a comprehensive understanding of the human body's geometry and motion, thereby enhancing the prediction of the player's trajectory. We use encoder-decoder Transformer architecture trained on the joints and trajectory information of the players with ball positions. The predicted sequence can provide information to help close-up cameras to keep tracking the tennis player, following centroid coordinates. We generate a high-quality dataset from multiple videos to assist tennis player movement prediction using object detection and human pose estimation methods. It contains bounding boxes and joint information for tennis players and ball positions in singles tennis games. Our method shows promising results in predicting the tennis player's movement trajectory with different sequence prediction lengths using the joints and trajectory information with the ball position.</description>

      <title>FedDP: Privacy-preserving method based on federated learning for histopathology image segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining of whole slide images (WSIs) is considered the gold standard for pathologists and medical practitioners for tumor diagnosis, surgical planning, and post-operative assessment. With the rapid advancement of deep learning technologies, the development of numerous models based on convolutional neural networks and transformer-based models has been applied to the precise segmentation of WSIs. However, due to privacy regulations and the need to protect patient confidentiality, centralized storage and processing of image data are impractical. Training a centralized model directly is challenging to implement in medical settings due to these privacy concerns.This paper addresses the dispersed nature and privacy sensitivity of medical image data by employing a federated learning framework, allowing medical institutions to collaboratively learn while protecting patient privacy. Additionally, to address the issue of original data reconstruction through gradient inversion during the federated learning training process, differential privacy introduces noise into the model updates, preventing attackers from inferring the contributions of individual samples, thereby protecting the privacy of the training data.Experimental results show that the proposed method, FedDP, minimally impacts model accuracy while effectively safeguarding the privacy of cancer pathology image data, with only a slight decrease in Dice, Jaccard, and Acc indices by 0.55%, 0.63%, and 0.42%, respectively. This approach facilitates cross-institutional collaboration and knowledge sharing while protecting sensitive data privacy, providing a viable solution for further research and application in the medical field.</description>

      <title>l0-Regularized Sparse Coding-based Interpretable Network for Multi-Modal Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal image fusion (MMIF) enhances the information content of the fused image by combining the unique as well as common features obtained from different modality sensor images, improving visualization, object detection, and many more tasks. In this work, we introduce an interpretable network for the MMIF task, named FNet, based on an l0-regularized multi-modal convolutional sparse coding (MCSC) model. Specifically, for solving the l0-regularized CSC problem, we develop an algorithm unrolling-based l0-regularized sparse coding (LZSC) block. Given different modality source images, FNet first separates the unique and common features from them using the LZSC block and then these features are combined to generate the final fused image. Additionally, we propose an l0-regularized MCSC model for the inverse fusion process. Based on this model, we introduce an interpretable inverse fusion network named IFNet, which is utilized during FNet's training. Extensive experiments show that FNet achieves high-quality fusion results across five different MMIF tasks. Furthermore, we show that FNet enhances downstream object detection in visible-thermal image pairs. We have also visualized the intermediate results of FNet, which demonstrates the good interpretability of our network.</description>

      <title>Neural Fingerprints for Adversarial Attack Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models for image classification have become standard tools in recent years. A well known vulnerability of these models is their susceptibility to adversarial examples. These are generated by slightly altering an image of a certain class in a way that is imperceptible to humans but causes the model to classify it wrongly as another class. Many algorithms have been proposed to address this problem, falling generally into one of two categories: (i) building robust classifiers (ii) directly detecting attacked images. Despite the good performance of these detectors, we argue that in a white-box setting, where the attacker knows the configuration and weights of the network and the detector, they can overcome the detector by running many examples on a local copy, and sending only those that were not detected to the actual model. This problem is common in security applications where even a very good model is not sufficient to ensure safety. In this paper we propose to overcome this inherent limitation of any static defence with randomization. To do so, one must generate a very large family of detectors with consistent performance, and select one or more of them randomly for each input. For the individual detectors, we suggest the method of neural fingerprints. In the training phase, for each class we repeatedly sample a tiny random subset of neurons from certain layers of the network, and if their average is sufficiently different between clean and attacked images of the focal class they are considered a fingerprint and added to the detector bank. During test time, we sample fingerprints from the bank associated with the label predicted by the model, and detect attacks using a likelihood ratio test. We evaluate our detectors on ImageNet with different attack methods and model architectures, and show near-perfect detection with low rates of false detection.</description>

      <title>DomainGallery: Few-shot Domain-driven Image Generation by Attribute-centric Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent progress in text-to-image models pretrained on large-scale datasets has enabled us to generate various images as long as we provide a text prompt describing what we want. Nevertheless, the availability of these models is still limited when we expect to generate images that fall into a specific domain either hard to describe or just unseen to the models. In this work, we propose DomainGallery, a few-shot domain-driven image generation method which aims at finetuning pretrained Stable Diffusion on few-shot target datasets in an attribute-centric manner. Specifically, DomainGallery features prior attribute erasure, attribute disentanglement, regularization and enhancement. These techniques are tailored to few-shot domain-driven generation in order to solve key issues that previous works have failed to settle. Extensive experiments are given to validate the superior performance of DomainGallery on a variety of domain-driven generation scenarios. Codes are available at https://github.com/Ldhlwh/DomainGallery.</description>

      <title>PASSION for Dermatology: Bridging the Diversity Gap with Pigmented Skin Images from Sub-Saharan Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Africa faces a huge shortage of dermatologists, with less than one per million people. This is in stark contrast to the high demand for dermatologic care, with 80% of the paediatric population suffering from largely untreated skin conditions. The integration of AI into healthcare sparks significant hope for treatment accessibility, especially through the development of AI-supported teledermatology. Current AI models are predominantly trained on white-skinned patients and do not generalize well enough to pigmented patients. The PASSION project aims to address this issue by collecting images of skin diseases in Sub-Saharan countries with the aim of open-sourcing this data. This dataset is the first of its kind, consisting of 1,653 patients for a total of 4,901 images. The images are representative of telemedicine settings and encompass the most common paediatric conditions: eczema, fungals, scabies, and impetigo. We also provide a baseline machine learning model trained on the dataset and a detailed performance analysis for the subpopulations represented in the dataset. The project website can be found at https://passionderm.github.io/.</description>

      <title>On the Inherent Robustness of One-Stage Object Detection against Out-of-Distribution Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robustness is a fundamental aspect for developing safe and trustworthy models, particularly when they are deployed in the open world. In this work we analyze the inherent capability of one-stage object detectors to robustly operate in the presence of out-of-distribution (OoD) data. Specifically, we propose a novel detection algorithm for detecting unknown objects in image data, which leverages the features extracted by the model from each sample. Differently from other recent approaches in the literature, our proposal does not require retraining the object detector, thereby allowing for the use of pretrained models. Our proposed OoD detector exploits the application of supervised dimensionality reduction techniques to mitigate the effects of the curse of dimensionality on the features extracted by the model. Furthermore, it utilizes high-resolution feature maps to identify potential unknown objects in an unsupervised fashion. Our experiments analyze the Pareto trade-off between the performance detecting known and unknown objects resulting from different algorithmic configurations and inference confidence thresholds. We also compare the performance of our proposed algorithm to that of logits-based post-hoc OoD methods, as well as possible fusion strategies. Finally, we discuss on the competitiveness of all tested methods against state-of-the-art OoD approaches for object detection models over the recently published Unknown Object Detection benchmark. The obtained results verify that the performance of avant-garde post-hoc OoD detectors can be further improved when combined with our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Semi-Supervised Learning on Line Segment Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a method for line segment detection in images, based on a semi-supervised framework. Leveraging the use of a consistency loss based on differently augmented and perturbed unlabeled images with a small amount of labeled data, we show comparable results to fully supervised methods. This opens up application scenarios where annotation is difficult or expensive, and for domain specific adaptation of models. We are specifically interested in real-time and online applications, and investigate small and efficient learning backbones. Our method is to our knowledge the first to target line detection using modern state-of-the-art methodologies for semi-supervised learning. We test the method on both standard benchmarks and domain specific scenarios for forestry applications, showing the tractability of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Social EgoMesh Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D pose of the camera wearer in egocentric video sequences is crucial to modeling human behavior in virtual and augmented reality applications. The task presents unique challenges due to the limited visibility of the user's body caused by the front-facing camera mounted on their head. Recent research has explored the utilization of the scene and ego-motion, but it has overlooked humans' interactive nature. We propose a novel framework for Social Egocentric Estimation of body MEshes (SEE-ME). Our approach is the first to estimate the wearer's mesh using only a latent probabilistic diffusion model, which we condition on the scene and, for the first time, on the social wearer-interactee interactions. Our in-depth study sheds light on when social interaction matters most for ego-mesh estimation; it quantifies the impact of interpersonal distance and gaze direction. Overall, SEE-ME surpasses the current best technique, reducing the pose estimation error (MPJPE) by 53%. The code is available at https://github.com/L-Scofano/SEEME.</description>

      <title>Cross- and Intra-image Prototypical Learning for Multi-label Disease Diagnosis and Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in prototypical learning have shown remarkable potential to provide useful decision interpretations associating activation maps and predictions with class-specific training prototypes. Such prototypical learning has been well-studied for various single-label diseases, but for quite relevant and more challenging multi-label diagnosis, where multiple diseases are often concurrent within an image, existing prototypical learning models struggle to obtain meaningful activation maps and effective class prototypes due to the entanglement of the multiple diseases. In this paper, we present a novel Cross- and Intra-image Prototypical Learning (CIPL) framework, for accurate multi-label disease diagnosis and interpretation from medical images. CIPL takes advantage of common cross-image semantics to disentangle the multiple diseases when learning the prototypes, allowing a comprehensive understanding of complicated pathological lesions. Furthermore, we propose a new two-level alignment-based regularisation strategy that effectively leverages consistent intra-image information to enhance interpretation robustness and predictive performance. Extensive experiments show that our CIPL attains the state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification accuracy in two public multi-label benchmarks of disease diagnosis: thoracic radiography and fundus images. Quantitative interpretability results show that CIPL also has superiority in weakly-supervised thoracic disease localisation over other leading saliency- and prototype-based explanation methods.</description>

      <title>Solar potential analysis over Indian cities using high-resolution satellite imagery and DEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the research work in the solar potential analysis is performed utilizing aerial imagery, LiDAR data, and satellite imagery. However, in the existing studies using satellite data, parameters such as trees/ vegetation shadow, adjacent higher architectural structures, and eccentric roof structures in urban areas were not considered, and relatively coarser-resolution datasets were used for analysis. In this work, we have implemented a novel approach to estimate rooftop solar potential using inputs of high-resolution satellite imagery (0.5 cm), a digital elevation model (1m), along with ground station radiation data. Solar radiation analysis is performed using the diffusion proportion and transmissivity ratio derived from the ground station data hosted by IMD. It was observed that due to seasonal variations, environmental effects and technical reasons such as solar panel structure etc., there can be a significant loss of electricity generation up to 50%. Based on the results, it is also understood that using 1m DEM and 50cm satellite imagery, more authentic results are produced over the urban areas.</description>

      <title>Population estimation using 3D city modelling and Carto2S datasets -- A case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the launch of Carto2S series of satellites, high resolution images (0.6-1.0 meters) are acquired and available for use. High resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with better accuracies can be generated using C2S multi-view and multi date datasets. DEMs are further used as an input to derive Digital terrain models (DTMs) and to extract accurate heights of the objects (building and tree) over the surface of the Earth. Extracted building heights are validated with ground control points and can be used for generation of city modelling and resource estimation like population estimation, health planning, water and transport resource estimations. In this study, an attempt is made to assess the population of a township using high-resolution Indian remote sensing satellite datasets. We used Carto 2S multi-view data and generated a precise DEM and DTM over a city area. Using DEM and DTM datasets, accurate heights of the buildings are extracted which are further validated with ground data. Accurate building heights and high resolution imagery are used for generating accurate virtual 3D city model and assessing the number of floor and carpet area of the houses/ flats/ apartments. Population estimation of the area is made using derived information of no of houses/ flats/ apartments from the satellite datasets. Further, information about number of hospital and schools around the residential area is extracted from open street maps (OSM). Population estimation using satellite data and derived information from OSM datasets can prove to be very good tool for local administrator and decision makers.</description>

      <title>Multi-temporal crack segmentation in concrete structure using deep learning approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cracks are among the earliest indicators of deterioration in concrete structures. Early automatic detection of these cracks can significantly extend the lifespan of critical infrastructures, such as bridges, buildings, and tunnels, while simultaneously reducing maintenance costs and facilitating efficient structural health monitoring. This study investigates whether leveraging multi-temporal data for crack segmentation can enhance segmentation quality. Therefore, we compare a Swin UNETR trained on multi-temporal data with a U-Net trained on mono-temporal data to assess the effect of temporal information compared with conventional single-epoch approaches. To this end, a multi-temporal dataset comprising 1356 images, each with 32 sequential crack propagation images, was created. After training the models, experiments were conducted to analyze their generalization ability, temporal consistency, and segmentation quality. The multi-temporal approach consistently outperformed its mono-temporal counterpart, achieving an IoU of $82.72\%$ and a F1-score of $90.54\%$, representing a significant improvement over the mono-temporal model's IoU of $76.69\%$ and F1-score of $86.18\%$, despite requiring only half of the trainable parameters. The multi-temporal model also displayed a more consistent segmentation quality, with reduced noise and fewer errors. These results suggest that temporal information significantly enhances the performance of segmentation models, offering a promising solution for improved crack detection and the long-term monitoring of concrete structures, even with limited sequential data.</description>

      <title>Brain Tumour Removing and Missing Modality Generation using 3D WDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the second-placed solution for task 8 and the participation solution for task 7 of BraTS 2024. The adoption of automated brain analysis algorithms to support clinical practice is increasing. However, many of these algorithms struggle with the presence of brain lesions or the absence of certain MRI modalities. The alterations in the brain's morphology leads to high variability and thus poor performance of predictive models that were trained only on healthy brains. The lack of information that is usually provided by some of the missing MRI modalities also reduces the reliability of the prediction models trained with all modalities. In order to improve the performance of these models, we propose the use of conditional 3D wavelet diffusion models. The wavelet transform enabled full-resolution image training and prediction on a GPU with 48 GB VRAM, without patching or downsampling, preserving all information for prediction. For the inpainting task of BraTS 2024, the use of a large and variable number of healthy masks and the stability and efficiency of the 3D wavelet diffusion model resulted in 0.007, 22.61 and 0.842 in the validation set and 0.07 , 22.8 and 0.91 in the testing set (MSE, PSNR and SSIM respectively). The code for these tasks is available at https://github.com/ShadowTwin41/BraTS_2023_2024_solutions.</description>

      <title>Improved Multi-Task Brain Tumour Segmentation with Synthetic Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the winning solution of task 1 and the third-placed solution of task 3 of the BraTS challenge. The use of automated tools in clinical practice has increased due to the development of more and more sophisticated and reliable algorithms. However, achieving clinical standards and developing tools for real-life scenarios is a major challenge. To this end, BraTS has organised tasks to find the most advanced solutions for specific purposes. In this paper, we propose the use of synthetic data to train state-of-the-art frameworks in order to improve the segmentation of adult gliomas in a post-treatment scenario, and the segmentation of meningioma for radiotherapy planning. Our results suggest that the use of synthetic data leads to more robust algorithms, although the synthetic data generation pipeline is not directly suited to the meningioma task. The code for these tasks is available at https://github.com/ShadowTwin41/BraTS_2023_2024_solutions.</description>

      <title>TAP-VL: Text Layout-Aware Pre-training for Enriched Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language (VL) models have garnered considerable research interest; however, they still face challenges in effectively handling text within images. To address this limitation, researchers have developed two approaches. The first method involves utilizing external Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools to extract textual information from images, which is then prepended to other textual inputs. The second strategy focuses on employing extremely high-resolution images to improve text recognition capabilities. In this paper, we focus on enhancing the first strategy by introducing a novel method, named TAP-VL, which treats OCR information as a distinct modality and seamlessly integrates it into any VL model. TAP-VL employs a lightweight transformer-based OCR module to receive OCR with layout information, compressing it into a short fixed-length sequence for input into the LLM. Initially, we conduct model-agnostic pretraining of the OCR module on unlabeled documents, followed by its integration into any VL architecture through brief fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent performance improvements when applying TAP-VL to top-performing VL models, across scene-text and document-based VL benchmarks.</description>

      <title>DanceFusion: A Spatio-Temporal Skeleton Diffusion Transformer for Audio-Driven Dance Motion Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces DanceFusion, a novel framework for reconstructing and generating dance movements synchronized to music, utilizing a Spatio-Temporal Skeleton Diffusion Transformer. The framework adeptly handles incomplete and noisy skeletal data common in short-form dance videos on social media platforms like TikTok. DanceFusion incorporates a hierarchical Transformer-based Variational Autoencoder (VAE) integrated with a diffusion model, significantly enhancing motion realism and accuracy. Our approach introduces sophisticated masking techniques and a unique iterative diffusion process that refines the motion sequences, ensuring high fidelity in both motion generation and synchronization with accompanying audio cues. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that DanceFusion surpasses existing methods, providing state-of-the-art performance in generating dynamic, realistic, and stylistically diverse dance motions. Potential applications of this framework extend to content creation, virtual reality, and interactive entertainment, promising substantial advancements in automated dance generation.

      <title>ICH-SCNet: Intracerebral Hemorrhage Segmentation and Prognosis Classification Network Using CLIP-guided SAM mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most fatal subtype of stroke and is characterized by a high incidence of disability. Accurate segmentation of the ICH region and prognosis prediction are critically important for developing and refining treatment plans for post-ICH patients. However, existing approaches address these two tasks independently and predominantly focus on imaging data alone, thereby neglecting the intrinsic correlation between the tasks and modalities. This paper introduces a multi-task network, ICH-SCNet, designed for both ICH segmentation and prognosis classification. Specifically, we integrate a SAM-CLIP cross-modal interaction mechanism that combines medical text and segmentation auxiliary information with neuroimaging data to enhance cross-modal feature recognition. Additionally, we develop an effective feature fusion module and a multi-task loss function to improve performance further. Extensive experiments on an ICH dataset reveal that our approach surpasses other state-of-the-art methods. It excels in the overall performance of classification tasks and outperforms competing models in all segmentation task metrics.</description>

Abstract: In the 1970s, the United States Environmental Protection Agency sponsored Documerica, a large-scale photography initiative to document environmental subjects nation-wide. While over 15,000 digitized public-domain photographs from the collection are available online, most of the images were scanned from damaged copies of the original prints. We present and evaluate a modified histogram matching technique based on the underlying chemistry of the prints for correcting the damaged images by using training data collected from a small set of undamaged prints. The entire set of color-adjusted Documerica images is made available in an open repository.</description>

      <title>Explainable Search and Discovery of Visual Cultural Heritage Collections with Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many cultural institutions have made large digitized visual collections available online, often under permissible re-use licences. Creating interfaces for exploring and searching these collections is difficult, particularly in the absence of granular metadata. In this paper, we introduce a method for using state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (LLMs) to enable an open-ended, explainable search and discovery interface for visual collections. We show how our approach can create novel clustering and recommendation systems that avoid common pitfalls of methods based directly on visual embeddings. Of particular interest is the ability to offer concrete textual explanations of each recommendation without the need to preselect the features of interest. Together, these features can create a digital interface that is more open-ended and flexible while also being better suited to addressing privacy and ethical concerns. Through a case study using a collection of documentary photographs, we provide several metrics showing the efficacy and possibilities of our approach.</description>

      <title>DNN-based 3D Cloud Retrieval for Variable Solar Illumination and Multiview Spaceborne Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate studies often rely on remotely sensed images to retrieve two-dimensional maps of cloud properties. To advance volumetric analysis, we focus on recovering the three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous extinction coefficient field of shallow clouds using multiview remote sensing data. Climate research requires large-scale worldwide statistics. To enable scalable data processing, previous deep neural networks (DNNs) can infer at spaceborne remote sensing downlink rates. However, prior methods are limited to a fixed solar illumination direction. In this work, we introduce the first scalable DNN-based system for 3D cloud retrieval that accommodates varying camera poses and solar directions. By integrating multiview cloud intensity images with camera poses and solar direction data, we achieve greater flexibility in recovery. Training of the DNN is performed by a novel two-stage scheme to address the high number of degrees of freedom in this problem. Our approach shows substantial improvements over previous state-of-the-art, particularly in handling variations in the sun's zenith angle.</description>

      <title>Personalized Federated Learning for Cross-view Geo-localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a methodology combining Federated Learning (FL) with Cross-view Image Geo-localization (CVGL) techniques. We address the challenges of data privacy and heterogeneity in autonomous vehicle environments by proposing a personalized Federated Learning scenario that allows selective sharing of model parameters. Our method implements a coarse-to-fine approach, where clients share only the coarse feature extractors while keeping fine-grained features specific to local environments. We evaluate our approach against traditional centralized and single-client training schemes using the KITTI dataset combined with satellite imagery. Results demonstrate that our federated CVGL method achieves performance close to centralized training while maintaining data privacy. The proposed partial model sharing strategy shows comparable or slightly better performance than classical FL, offering significant reduced communication overhead without sacrificing accuracy. Our work contributes to more robust and privacy-preserving localization systems for autonomous vehicles operating in diverse environments</description>

      <title>Reciprocal Point Learning Network with Large Electromagnetic Kernel for SAR Open-Set Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limitations of existing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) methods lie in their confinement by the closed-environment assumption, hindering their effective and robust handling of unknown target categories in open environments. Open Set Recognition (OSR), a pivotal facet for algorithmic practicality, intends to categorize known classes while denoting unknown ones as "unknown." The chief challenge in OSR involves concurrently mitigating risks associated with generalizing features from a restricted set of known classes to numerous unknown samples and the open space exposure to potential unknown data. To enhance open-set SAR classification, a method called scattering kernel with reciprocal learning network is proposed. Initially, a feature learning framework is constructed based on reciprocal point learning (RPL), establishing a bounded space for potential unknown classes. This approach indirectly introduces unknown information into a learner confined to known classes, thereby acquiring more concise and discriminative representations. Subsequently, considering the variability in the imaging of targets at different angles and the discreteness of components in SAR images, a proposal is made to design convolutional kernels based on large-sized attribute scattering center models. This enhances the ability to extract intrinsic non-linear features and specific scattering characteristics in SAR images, thereby improving the discriminative features of the model and mitigating the impact of imaging variations on classification performance. Experiments on the MSTAR datasets substantiate the superior performance of the proposed approach called ASC-RPL over mainstream methods.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Brightness Adaptation for Robust Multi-modal Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion aim to integrate modality strengths for visually enhanced, informative images. Visible imaging in real-world scenarios is susceptible to dynamic environmental brightness fluctuations, leading to texture degradation. Existing fusion methods lack robustness against such brightness perturbations, significantly compromising the visual fidelity of the fused imagery. To address this challenge, we propose the Brightness Adaptive multimodal dynamic fusion framework (BA-Fusion), which achieves robust image fusion despite dynamic brightness fluctuations. Specifically, we introduce a Brightness Adaptive Gate (BAG) module, which is designed to dynamically select features from brightness-related channels for normalization, while preserving brightness-independent structural information within the source images. Furthermore, we propose a brightness consistency loss function to optimize the BAG module. The entire framework is tuned via alternating training strategies. Extensive experiments validate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art methods in preserving multi-modal image information and visual fidelity, while exhibiting remarkable robustness across varying brightness levels.

      <title>ESC-MISR: Enhancing Spatial Correlations for Multi-Image Super-Resolution in Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Image Super-Resolution (MISR) is a crucial yet challenging research task in the remote sensing community. In this paper, we address the challenging task of Multi-Image Super-Resolution in Remote Sensing (MISR-RS), aiming to generate a High-Resolution (HR) image from multiple Low-Resolution (LR) images obtained by satellites. Recently, the weak temporal correlations among LR images have attracted increasing attention in the MISR-RS task. However, existing MISR methods treat the LR images as sequences with strong temporal correlations, overlooking spatial correlations and imposing temporal dependencies. To address this problem, we propose a novel end-to-end framework named Enhancing Spatial Correlations in MISR (ESC-MISR), which fully exploits the spatial-temporal relations of multiple images for HR image reconstruction. Specifically, we first introduce a novel fusion module named Multi-Image Spatial Transformer (MIST), which emphasizes parts with clearer global spatial features and enhances the spatial correlations between LR images. Besides, we perform a random shuffle strategy for the sequential inputs of LR images to attenuate temporal dependencies and capture weak temporal correlations in the training stage. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our ESC-MISR achieves 0.70dB and 0.76dB cPSNR improvements on the two bands of the PROBA-V dataset respectively, demonstrating the superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>From CNN to ConvRNN: Adapting Visualization Techniques for Time-Series Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, neural networks are commonly used to solve various problems. Unfortunately, despite their effectiveness, they are often perceived as black boxes capable of providing answers without explaining their decisions, which raises numerous ethical and legal concerns. Fortunately, the field of explainability helps users understand these results. This aspect of machine learning allows users to grasp the decision-making process of a model and verify the relevance of its outcomes. In this article, we focus on the learning process carried out by a ``time distributed`` convRNN, which performs anomaly detection from video data.</description>

      <title>TIP-I2V: A Million-Scale Real Text and Image Prompt Dataset for Image-to-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generation models are revolutionizing content creation, with image-to-video models drawing increasing attention due to their enhanced controllability, visual consistency, and practical applications. However, despite their popularity, these models rely on user-provided text and image prompts, and there is currently no dedicated dataset for studying these prompts. In this paper, we introduce TIP-I2V, the first large-scale dataset of over 1.70 million unique user-provided Text and Image Prompts specifically for Image-to-Video generation. Additionally, we provide the corresponding generated videos from five state-of-the-art image-to-video models. We begin by outlining the time-consuming and costly process of curating this large-scale dataset. Next, we compare TIP-I2V to two popular prompt datasets, VidProM (text-to-video) and DiffusionDB (text-to-image), highlighting differences in both basic and semantic information. This dataset enables advancements in image-to-video research. For instance, to develop better models, researchers can use the prompts in TIP-I2V to analyze user preferences and evaluate the multi-dimensional performance of their trained models; and to enhance model safety, they may focus on addressing the misinformation issue caused by image-to-video models. The new research inspired by TIP-I2V and the differences with existing datasets emphasize the importance of a specialized image-to-video prompt dataset. The project is publicly available at https://tip-i2v.github.io.</description>

      <title>Progressive Multi-Level Alignments for Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation SAR Target Recognition Using Simulated Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, an intriguing research trend for automatic target recognition (ATR) from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has arisen: using simulated data to train ATR models is a feasible solution to the issue of inadequate measured data. To close the domain gap that exists between the real and simulated data, the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques are frequently exploited to construct ATR models. However, for UDA, the target domain lacks labeled data to direct the model training, posing a great challenge to ATR performance. To address the above problem, a semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) framework has been proposed adopting progressive multi-level alignments for simulated data-aided SAR ATR. First, a progressive wavelet transform data augmentation (PWTDA) is presented by analyzing the discrepancies of wavelet decomposition sub-bands of two domain images, obtaining the domain-level alignment. Specifically, the domain gap is narrowed by mixing the wavelet transform high-frequency sub-band components. Second, we develop an asymptotic instance-prototype alignment (AIPA) strategy to push the source domain instances close to the corresponding target prototypes, aiming to achieve category-level alignment. Moreover, the consistency alignment is implemented by excavating the strong-weak augmentation consistency of both individual samples and the multi-sample relationship, enhancing the generalization capability of the model. Extensive experiments on the Synthetic and Measured Paired Labeled Experiment (SAMPLE) dataset, indicate that our approach obtains recognition accuracies of 99.63% and 98.91% in two common experimental settings with only one labeled sample per class of the target domain, outperforming the most advanced SSDA techniques.</description>

      <title>SEE-DPO: Self Entropy Enhanced Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been successfully used to align large language models (LLMs) according to human preferences, and more recently it has also been applied to improving the quality of text-to-image diffusion models. However, DPO-based methods such as SPO, Diffusion-DPO, and D3PO are highly susceptible to overfitting and reward hacking, especially when the generative model is optimized to fit out-of-distribution during prolonged training. To overcome these challenges and stabilize the training of diffusion models, we introduce a self-entropy regularization mechanism in reinforcement learning from human feedback. This enhancement improves DPO training by encouraging broader exploration and greater robustness. Our regularization technique effectively mitigates reward hacking, leading to improved stability and enhanced image quality across the latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating human feedback with self-entropy regularization can significantly boost image diversity and specificity, achieving state-of-the-art results on key image generation metrics.</description>

      <title>Multi-Reward as Condition for Instruction-based Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality training triplets (instruction, original image, edited image) are essential for instruction-based image editing. Predominant training datasets (e.g., InsPix2Pix) are created using text-to-image generative models (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL-E) which are not trained for image editing. Accordingly, these datasets suffer from inaccurate instruction following, poor detail preserving, and generation artifacts. In this paper, we propose to address the training data quality issue with multi-perspective reward data instead of refining the ground-truth image quality. 1) we first design a quantitative metric system based on best-in-class LVLM (Large Vision Language Model), i.e., GPT-4o in our case, to evaluate the generation quality from 3 perspectives, namely, instruction following, detail preserving, and generation quality. For each perspective, we collected quantitative score in $0\sim 5$ and text descriptive feedback on the specific failure points in ground-truth edited images, resulting in a high-quality editing reward dataset, i.e., RewardEdit20K. 2) We further proposed a novel training framework to seamlessly integrate the metric output, regarded as multi-reward, into editing models to learn from the imperfect training triplets. During training, the reward scores and text descriptions are encoded as embeddings and fed into both the latent space and the U-Net of the editing models as auxiliary conditions. During inference, we set these additional conditions to the highest score with no text description for failure points, to aim at the best generation outcome. Experiments indicate that our multi-reward conditioned model outperforms its no-reward counterpart on two popular editing pipelines, i.e., InsPix2Pix and SmartEdit. The code and dataset will be released.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Disparity from Dual-Pixel Images: Physics-Informed Lightweight Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a high-performance disparity (depth) estimation method using dual-pixel (DP) images with few parameters. Conventional end-to-end deep-learning methods have many parameters but do not fully exploit disparity constraints, which limits their performance. Therefore, we propose a lightweight disparity estimation method based on a completion-based network that explicitly constrains disparity and learns the physical and systemic disparity properties of DP. By modeling the DP-specific disparity error parametrically and using it for sampling during training, the network acquires the unique properties of DP and enhances robustness. This learning also allows us to use a common RGB-D dataset for training without a DP dataset, which is labor-intensive to acquire. Furthermore, we propose a non-learning-based refinement framework that efficiently handles inherent disparity expansion errors by appropriately refining the confidence map of the network output. As a result, the proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results while reducing the overall system size to 1/5 of that of the conventional method, even without using the DP dataset for training, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness. The code and dataset are available on our project site.</description>

      <title>NeuroFly: A framework for whole-brain single neuron reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurons, with their elongated, tree-like dendritic and axonal structures, enable efficient signal integration and long-range communication across brain regions. By reconstructing individual neurons' morphology, we can gain valuable insights into brain connectivity, revealing the structure basis of cognition, movement, and perception. Despite the accumulation of extensive 3D microscopic imaging data, progress has been considerably hindered by the absence of automated tools to streamline this process. Here we introduce NeuroFly, a validated framework for large-scale automatic single neuron reconstruction. This framework breaks down the process into three distinct stages: segmentation, connection, and proofreading. In the segmentation stage, we perform automatic segmentation followed by skeletonization to generate over-segmented neuronal fragments without branches. During the connection stage, we use a 3D image-based path following approach to extend each fragment and connect it with other fragments of the same neuron. Finally, human annotators are required only to proofread the few unresolved positions. The first two stages of our process are clearly defined computer vision problems, and we have trained robust baseline models to solve them. We validated NeuroFly's efficiency using in-house datasets that include a variety of challenging scenarios, such as dense arborizations, weak axons, images with contamination. We will release the datasets along with a suite of visualization and annotation tools for better reproducibility. Our goal is to foster collaboration among researchers to address the neuron reconstruction challenge, ultimately accelerating advancements in neuroscience research.

      <title>Controlling Human Shape and Pose in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a methodology for conditional control of human shape and pose in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models using a 3D human parametric model (SMPL). Fine-tuning these diffusion models to adhere to new conditions requires large datasets and high-quality annotations, which can be more cost-effectively acquired through synthetic data generation rather than real-world data. However, the domain gap and low scene diversity of synthetic data can compromise the pretrained model's visual fidelity. We propose a domain-adaptation technique that maintains image quality by isolating synthetically trained conditional information in the classifier-free guidance vector and composing it with another control network to adapt the generated images to the input domain. To achieve SMPL control, we fine-tune a ControlNet-based architecture on the synthetic SURREAL dataset of rendered humans and apply our domain adaptation at generation time. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves greater shape and pose diversity than the 2d pose-based ControlNet, while maintaining the visual fidelity and improving stability, proving its usefulness for downstream tasks such as human animation.</description>

      <title>Taming Rectified Flow for Inversion and Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rectified-flow-based diffusion transformers, such as FLUX and OpenSora, have demonstrated exceptional performance in the field of image and video generation. Despite their robust generative capabilities, these models often suffer from inaccurate inversion, which could further limit their effectiveness in downstream tasks such as image and video editing. To address this issue, we propose RF-Solver, a novel training-free sampler that enhances inversion precision by reducing errors in the process of solving rectified flow ODEs. Specifically, we derive the exact formulation of the rectified flow ODE and perform a high-order Taylor expansion to estimate its nonlinear components, significantly decreasing the approximation error at each timestep. Building upon RF-Solver, we further design RF-Edit, which comprises specialized sub-modules for image and video editing. By sharing self-attention layer features during the editing process, RF-Edit effectively preserves the structural information of the source image or video while achieving high-quality editing results. Our approach is compatible with any pre-trained rectified-flow-based models for image and video tasks, requiring no additional training or optimization. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation, image &amp; video inversion, and image &amp; video editing demonstrate the robust performance and adaptability of our methods.

      <title>GANESH: Generalizable NeRF for Lensless Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lensless imaging offers a significant opportunity to develop ultra-compact cameras by removing the conventional bulky lens system. However, without a focusing element, the sensor's output is no longer a direct image but a complex multiplexed scene representation. Traditional methods have attempted to address this challenge by employing learnable inversions and refinement models, but these methods are primarily designed for 2D reconstruction and do not generalize well to 3D reconstruction. We introduce GANESH, a novel framework designed to enable simultaneous refinement and novel view synthesis from multi-view lensless images. Unlike existing methods that require scene-specific training, our approach supports on-the-fly inference without retraining on each scene. Moreover, our framework allows us to tune our model to specific scenes, enhancing the rendering and refinement quality. To facilitate research in this area, we also present the first multi-view lensless dataset, LenslessScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms current approaches in reconstruction accuracy and refinement quality.

      <title>End-to-end Inception-Unet based Generative Adversarial Networks for Snow and Rain Removals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superior performance introduced by deep learning approaches in removing atmospheric particles such as snow and rain from a single image; favors their usage over classical ones. However, deep learning-based approaches still suffer from challenges related to the particle appearance characteristics such as size, type, and transparency. Furthermore, due to the unique characteristics of rain and snow particles, single network based deep learning approaches struggle in handling both degradation scenarios simultaneously. In this paper, a global framework that consists of two Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is proposed where each handles the removal of each particle individually. The architectures of both desnowing and deraining GANs introduce the integration of a feature extraction phase with the classical U-net generator network which in turn enhances the removal performance in the presence of severe variations in size and appearance. Furthermore, a realistic dataset that contains pairs of snowy images next to their groundtruth images estimated using a low-rank approximation approach; is presented. The experiments show that the proposed desnowing and deraining approaches achieve significant improvements in comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches when tested on both synthetic and realistic datasets.</description>

      <title>D$^3$epth: Self-Supervised Depth Estimation with Dynamic Mask in Dynamic Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depth estimation is a crucial technology in robotics. Recently, self-supervised depth estimation methods have demonstrated great potential as they can efficiently leverage large amounts of unlabelled real-world data. However, most existing methods are designed under the assumption of static scenes, which hinders their adaptability in dynamic environments. To address this issue, we present D$^3$epth, a novel method for self-supervised depth estimation in dynamic scenes. It tackles the challenge of dynamic objects from two key perspectives. First, within the self-supervised framework, we design a reprojection constraint to identify regions likely to contain dynamic objects, allowing the construction of a dynamic mask that mitigates their impact at the loss level. Second, for multi-frame depth estimation, we introduce a cost volume auto-masking strategy that leverages adjacent frames to identify regions associated with dynamic objects and generate corresponding masks. This provides guidance for subsequent processes. Furthermore, we propose a spectral entropy uncertainty module that incorporates spectral entropy to guide uncertainty estimation during depth fusion, effectively addressing issues arising from cost volume computation in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments on KITTI and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing self-supervised monocular depth estimation baselines.

      <title>A multi-purpose automatic editing system based on lecture semantics for remote education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote teaching has become popular recently due to its convenience and safety, especially under extreme circumstances like a pandemic. However, online students usually have a poor experience since the information acquired from the views provided by the broadcast platforms is limited. One potential solution is to show more camera views simultaneously, but it is technically challenging and distracting for the viewers. Therefore, an automatic multi-camera directing/editing system, which aims at selecting the most concerned view at each time instance to guide the attention of online students, is in urgent demand. However, existing systems mostly make simple assumptions and focus on tracking the position of the speaker instead of the real lecture semantics, and therefore have limited capacities to deliver optimal information flow. To this end, this paper proposes an automatic multi-purpose editing system based on the lecture semantics, which can both direct the multiple video streams for real-time broadcasting and edit the optimal video offline for review purposes. Our system directs the views by semantically analyzing the class events while following the professional directing rules, mimicking a human director to capture the regions of interest from the viewpoint of the onsite students. We conduct both qualitative and quantitative analyses to verify the effectiveness of the proposed system and its components.</description>

      <title>ZAHA: Introducing the Level of Facade Generalization and the Large-Scale Point Cloud Facade Semantic Segmentation Benchmark Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facade semantic segmentation is a long-standing challenge in photogrammetry and computer vision. Although the last decades have witnessed the influx of facade segmentation methods, there is a lack of comprehensive facade classes and data covering the architectural variability. In ZAHA, we introduce Level of Facade Generalization (LoFG), novel hierarchical facade classes designed based on international urban modeling standards, ensuring compatibility with real-world challenging classes and uniform methods' comparison. Realizing the LoFG, we present to date the largest semantic 3D facade segmentation dataset, providing 601 million annotated points at five and 15 classes of LoFG2 and LoFG3, respectively. Moreover, we analyze the performance of baseline semantic segmentation methods on our introduced LoFG classes and data, complementing it with a discussion on the unresolved challenges for facade segmentation. We firmly believe that ZAHA shall facilitate further development of 3D facade semantic segmentation methods, enabling robust segmentation indispensable in creating urban digital twins.</description>

      <title>Boosting Latent Diffusion with Perceptual Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) power state-of-the-art high-resolution generative image models. LDMs learn the data distribution in the latent space of an autoencoder (AE) and produce images by mapping the generated latents into RGB image space using the AE decoder. While this approach allows for efficient model training and sampling, it induces a disconnect between the training of the diffusion model and the decoder, resulting in a loss of detail in the generated images. To remediate this disconnect, we propose to leverage the internal features of the decoder to define a latent perceptual loss (LPL). This loss encourages the models to create sharper and more realistic images. Our loss can be seamlessly integrated with common autoencoders used in latent diffusion models, and can be applied to different generative modeling paradigms such as DDPM with epsilon and velocity prediction, as well as flow matching. Extensive experiments with models trained on three datasets at 256 and 512 resolution show improved quantitative -- with boosts between 6% and 20% in FID -- and qualitative results when using our perceptual loss.</description>

      <title>In the Era of Prompt Learning with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale foundation models like CLIP have shown strong zero-shot generalization but struggle with domain shifts, limiting their adaptability. In our work, we introduce \textsc{StyLIP}, a novel domain-agnostic prompt learning strategy for Domain Generalization (DG). StyLIP disentangles visual style and content in CLIP`s vision encoder by using style projectors to learn domain-specific prompt tokens and combining them with content features. Trained contrastively, this approach enables seamless adaptation across domains, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple DG benchmarks. Additionally, we propose AD-CLIP for unsupervised domain adaptation (DA), leveraging CLIP`s frozen vision backbone to learn domain-invariant prompts through image style and content features. By aligning domains in embedding space with entropy minimization, AD-CLIP effectively handles domain shifts, even when only target domain samples are available. Lastly, we outline future work on class discovery using prompt learning for semantic segmentation in remote sensing, focusing on identifying novel or rare classes in unstructured environments. This paves the way for more adaptive and generalizable models in complex, real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Robust Iris Centre Localisation for Assistive Eye-Gaze Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research work, we address the problem of robust iris centre localisation in unconstrained conditions as a core component of our eye-gaze tracking platform. We investigate the application of U-Net variants for segmentation-based and regression-based approaches to improve our iris centre localisation, which was previously based on Bayes' classification. The achieved results are comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art, offering a drastic improvement over those achieved by the Bayes' classifier, and without sacrificing the real-time performance of our eye-gaze tracking platform.</description>

      <title>VideoGLaMM: A Large Multimodal Model for Pixel-Level Visual Grounding in Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-grained alignment between videos and text is challenging due to complex spatial and temporal dynamics in videos. Existing video-based Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) handle basic conversations but struggle with precise pixel-level grounding in videos. To address this, we introduce VideoGLaMM, a LMM designed for fine-grained pixel-level grounding in videos based on user-provided textual inputs. Our design seamlessly connects three key components: a Large Language Model, a dual vision encoder that emphasizes both spatial and temporal details, and a spatio-temporal decoder for accurate mask generation. This connection is facilitated via tunable V-L and L-V adapters that enable close Vision-Language (VL) alignment. The architecture is trained to synchronize both spatial and temporal elements of video content with textual instructions. To enable fine-grained grounding, we curate a multimodal dataset featuring detailed visually-grounded conversations using a semiautomatic annotation pipeline, resulting in a diverse set of 38k video-QA triplets along with 83k objects and 671k masks. We evaluate VideoGLaMM on three challenging tasks: Grounded Conversation Generation, Visual Grounding, and Referring Video Segmentation. Experimental results show that our model consistently outperforms existing approaches across all three tasks.</description>

      <title>MVSplat360: Feed-Forward 360 Scene Synthesis from Sparse Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MVSplat360, a feed-forward approach for 360{\deg} novel view synthesis (NVS) of diverse real-world scenes, using only sparse observations. This setting is inherently ill-posed due to minimal overlap among input views and insufficient visual information provided, making it challenging for conventional methods to achieve high-quality results. Our MVSplat360 addresses this by effectively combining geometry-aware 3D reconstruction with temporally consistent video generation. Specifically, it refactors a feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model to render features directly into the latent space of a pre-trained Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) model, where these features then act as pose and visual cues to guide the denoising process and produce photorealistic 3D-consistent views. Our model is end-to-end trainable and supports rendering arbitrary views with as few as 5 sparse input views. To evaluate MVSplat360's performance, we introduce a new benchmark using the challenging DL3DV-10K dataset, where MVSplat360 achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art methods on wide-sweeping or even 360{\deg} NVS tasks. Experiments on the existing benchmark RealEstate10K also confirm the effectiveness of our model. The video results are available on our project page: https://donydchen.github.io/mvsplat360.</description>

      <title>StoryAgent: Customized Storytelling Video Generation via Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of AI-Generated Content (AIGC) has spurred research into automated video generation to streamline conventional processes. However, automating storytelling video production, particularly for customized narratives, remains challenging due to the complexity of maintaining subject consistency across shots. While existing approaches like Mora and AesopAgent integrate multiple agents for Story-to-Video (S2V) generation, they fall short in preserving protagonist consistency and supporting Customized Storytelling Video Generation (CSVG). To address these limitations, we propose StoryAgent, a multi-agent framework designed for CSVG. StoryAgent decomposes CSVG into distinct subtasks assigned to specialized agents, mirroring the professional production process. Notably, our framework includes agents for story design, storyboard generation, video creation, agent coordination, and result evaluation. Leveraging the strengths of different models, StoryAgent enhances control over the generation process, significantly improving character consistency. Specifically, we introduce a customized Image-to-Video (I2V) method, LoRA-BE, to enhance intra-shot temporal consistency, while a novel storyboard generation pipeline is proposed to maintain subject consistency across shots. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in synthesizing highly consistent storytelling videos, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our contributions include the introduction of StoryAgent, a versatile framework for video generation tasks, and novel techniques for preserving protagonist consistency.</description>

      <title>DimensionX: Create Any 3D and 4D Scenes from a Single Image with Controllable Video Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce \textbf{DimensionX}, a framework designed to generate photorealistic 3D and 4D scenes from just a single image with video diffusion. Our approach begins with the insight that both the spatial structure of a 3D scene and the temporal evolution of a 4D scene can be effectively represented through sequences of video frames. While recent video diffusion models have shown remarkable success in producing vivid visuals, they face limitations in directly recovering 3D/4D scenes due to limited spatial and temporal controllability during generation. To overcome this, we propose ST-Director, which decouples spatial and temporal factors in video diffusion by learning dimension-aware LoRAs from dimension-variant data. This controllable video diffusion approach enables precise manipulation of spatial structure and temporal dynamics, allowing us to reconstruct both 3D and 4D representations from sequential frames with the combination of spatial and temporal dimensions. Additionally, to bridge the gap between generated videos and real-world scenes, we introduce a trajectory-aware mechanism for 3D generation and an identity-preserving denoising strategy for 4D generation. Extensive experiments on various real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that DimensionX achieves superior results in controllable video generation, as well as in 3D and 4D scene generation, compared with previous methods.</description>

      <title>SaSR-Net: Source-Aware Semantic Representation Network for Enhancing Audio-Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) is a challenging task that involves answering questions based on both auditory and visual information in videos. A significant challenge is interpreting complex multi-modal scenes, which include both visual objects and sound sources, and connecting them to the given question. In this paper, we introduce the Source-aware Semantic Representation Network (SaSR-Net), a novel model designed for AVQA. SaSR-Net utilizes source-wise learnable tokens to efficiently capture and align audio-visual elements with the corresponding question. It streamlines the fusion of audio and visual information using spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to identify answers in multi-modal scenes. Extensive experiments on the Music-AVQA and AVQA-Yang datasets show that SaSR-Net outperforms state-of-the-art AVQA methods.</description>

      <title>A Reinforcement Learning-Based Automatic Video Editing Method Using Pre-trained Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this era of videos, automatic video editing techniques attract more and more attention from industry and academia since they can reduce workloads and lower the requirements for human editors. Existing automatic editing systems are mainly scene- or event-specific, e.g., soccer game broadcasting, yet the automatic systems for general editing, e.g., movie or vlog editing which covers various scenes and events, were rarely studied before, and converting the event-driven editing method to a general scene is nontrivial. In this paper, we propose a two-stage scheme for general editing. Firstly, unlike previous works that extract scene-specific features, we leverage the pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) to extract the editing-relevant representations as editing context. Moreover, to close the gap between the professional-looking videos and the automatic productions generated with simple guidelines, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based editing framework to formulate the editing problem and train the virtual editor to make better sequential editing decisions. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on a more general editing task with a real movie dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed context representation and the learning ability of our RL-based editing framework.</description>

      <title>M3DocRAG: Multi-modal Retrieval is What You Need for Multi-page Multi-document Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document visual question answering (DocVQA) pipelines that answer questions from documents have broad applications. Existing methods focus on handling single-page documents with multi-modal language models (MLMs), or rely on text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that uses text extraction tools such as optical character recognition (OCR). However, there are difficulties in applying these methods in real-world scenarios: (a) questions often require information across different pages or documents, where MLMs cannot handle many long documents; (b) documents often have important information in visual elements such as figures, but text extraction tools ignore them. We introduce M3DocRAG, a novel multi-modal RAG framework that flexibly accommodates various document contexts (closed-domain and open-domain), question hops (single-hop and multi-hop), and evidence modalities (text, chart, figure, etc.). M3DocRAG finds relevant documents and answers questions using a multi-modal retriever and an MLM, so that it can efficiently handle single or many documents while preserving visual information. Since previous DocVQA datasets ask questions in the context of a specific document, we also present M3DocVQA, a new benchmark for evaluating open-domain DocVQA over 3,000+ PDF documents with 40,000+ pages. In three benchmarks (M3DocVQA/MMLongBench-Doc/MP-DocVQA), empirical results show that M3DocRAG with ColPali and Qwen2-VL 7B achieves superior performance than many strong baselines, including state-of-the-art performance in MP-DocVQA. We provide comprehensive analyses of different indexing, MLMs, and retrieval models. Lastly, we qualitatively show that M3DocRAG can successfully handle various scenarios, such as when relevant information exists across multiple pages and when answer evidence only exists in images.</description>

      <title>CAD-MLLM: Unifying Multimodality-Conditioned CAD Generation With MLLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to design a unified Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generation system that can easily generate CAD models based on the user's inputs in the form of textual description, images, point clouds, or even a combination of them. Towards this goal, we introduce the CAD-MLLM, the first system capable of generating parametric CAD models conditioned on the multimodal input. Specifically, within the CAD-MLLM framework, we leverage the command sequences of CAD models and then employ advanced large language models (LLMs) to align the feature space across these diverse multi-modalities data and CAD models' vectorized representations. To facilitate the model training, we design a comprehensive data construction and annotation pipeline that equips each CAD model with corresponding multimodal data. Our resulting dataset, named Omni-CAD, is the first multimodal CAD dataset that contains textual description, multi-view images, points, and command sequence for each CAD model. It contains approximately 450K instances and their CAD construction sequences. To thoroughly evaluate the quality of our generated CAD models, we go beyond current evaluation metrics that focus on reconstruction quality by introducing additional metrics that assess topology quality and surface enclosure extent. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CAD-MLLM significantly outperforms existing conditional generative methods and remains highly robust to noises and missing points.

      <title>Uncovering Hidden Subspaces in Video Diffusion Models Using Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent Video Diffusion Models can easily deceive casual observers and domain experts alike thanks to the produced image quality and temporal consistency. Beyond entertainment, this creates opportunities around safe data sharing of fully synthetic datasets, which are crucial in healthcare, as well as other domains relying on sensitive personal information. However, privacy concerns with this approach have not fully been addressed yet, and models trained on synthetic data for specific downstream tasks still perform worse than those trained on real data. This discrepancy may be partly due to the sampling space being a subspace of the training videos, effectively reducing the training data size for downstream models. Additionally, the reduced temporal consistency when generating long videos could be a contributing factor.
  In this paper, we first show that training privacy-preserving models in latent space is computationally more efficient and generalize better. Furthermore, to investigate downstream degradation factors, we propose to use a re-identification model, previously employed as a privacy preservation filter. We demonstrate that it is sufficient to train this model on the latent space of the video generator. Subsequently, we use these models to evaluate the subspace covered by synthetic video datasets and thus introduce a new way to measure the faithfulness of generative machine learning models. We focus on a specific application in healthcare echocardiography to illustrate the effectiveness of our novel methods. Our findings indicate that only up to 30.8% of the training videos are learned in latent video diffusion models, which could explain the lack of performance when training downstream tasks on synthetic data.</description>

Abstract: Mobile robots operating indoors must be prepared to navigate challenging scenes that contain transparent surfaces. This paper proposes a novel method for the fusion of acoustic and visual sensing modalities through implicit neural representations to enable dense reconstruction of transparent surfaces in indoor scenes. We propose a novel model that leverages generative latent optimization to learn an implicit representation of indoor scenes consisting of transparent surfaces. We demonstrate that we can query the implicit representation to enable volumetric rendering in image space or 3D geometry reconstruction (point clouds or mesh) with transparent surface prediction. We evaluate our method's effectiveness qualitatively and quantitatively on a new dataset collected using a custom, low-cost sensing platform featuring RGB-D cameras and ultrasonic sensors. Our method exhibits significant improvement over state-of-the-art for transparent surface reconstruction.</description>

      <title>AsCAN: Asymmetric Convolution-Attention Networks for Efficient Recognition and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network architecture design requires making many crucial decisions. The common desiderata is that similar decisions, with little modifications, can be reused in a variety of tasks and applications. To satisfy that, architectures must provide promising latency and performance trade-offs, support a variety of tasks, scale efficiently with respect to the amounts of data and compute, leverage available data from other tasks, and efficiently support various hardware. To this end, we introduce AsCAN -- a hybrid architecture, combining both convolutional and transformer blocks. We revisit the key design principles of hybrid architectures and propose a simple and effective \emph{asymmetric} architecture, where the distribution of convolutional and transformer blocks is \emph{asymmetric}, containing more convolutional blocks in the earlier stages, followed by more transformer blocks in later stages. AsCAN supports a variety of tasks: recognition, segmentation, class-conditional image generation, and features a superior trade-off between performance and latency. We then scale the same architecture to solve a large-scale text-to-image task and show state-of-the-art performance compared to the most recent public and commercial models. Notably, even without any computation optimization for transformer blocks, our models still yield faster inference speed than existing works featuring efficient attention mechanisms, highlighting the advantages and the value of our approach.</description>

      <title>Planar Reflection-Aware Neural Radiance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in reconstructing complex scenes with high fidelity. However, NeRF's view dependency can only handle low-frequency reflections. It falls short when handling complex planar reflections, often interpreting them as erroneous scene geometries and leading to duplicated and inaccurate scene representations. To address this challenge, we introduce a reflection-aware NeRF that jointly models planar reflectors, such as windows, and explicitly casts reflected rays to capture the source of the high-frequency reflections. We query a single radiance field to render the primary color and the source of the reflection. We propose a sparse edge regularization to help utilize the true sources of reflections for rendering planar reflections rather than creating a duplicate along the primary ray at the same depth. As a result, we obtain accurate scene geometry. Rendering along the primary ray results in a clean, reflection-free view, while explicitly rendering along the reflected ray allows us to reconstruct highly detailed reflections. Our extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations of real-world datasets demonstrate our method's enhanced performance in accurately handling reflections.</description>

      <title>SG-I2V: Self-Guided Trajectory Control in Image-to-Video Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods for image-to-video generation have achieved impressive, photo-realistic quality. However, adjusting specific elements in generated videos, such as object motion or camera movement, is often a tedious process of trial and error, e.g., involving re-generating videos with different random seeds. Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories. Yet, this fine-tuning procedure can be computationally expensive, and it requires datasets with annotated object motion, which can be difficult to procure. In this work, we introduce SG-I2V, a framework for controllable image-to-video generation that is self-guided$\unicode{x2013}$offering zero-shot control by relying solely on the knowledge present in a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model without the need for fine-tuning or external knowledge. Our zero-shot method outperforms unsupervised baselines while being competitive with supervised models in terms of visual quality and motion fidelity.</description>

      <title>LoFi: Scalable Local Image Reconstruction with Implicit Neural Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural fields or implicit neural representations (INRs) have attracted significant attention in machine learning and signal processing due to their efficient continuous representation of images and 3D volumes. In this work, we build on INRs and introduce a coordinate-based local processing framework for solving imaging inverse problems, termed LoFi (Local Field). Unlike conventional methods for image reconstruction, LoFi processes local information at each coordinate \textit{separately} by multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), recovering the object at that specific coordinate. Similar to INRs, LoFi can recover images at any continuous coordinate, enabling image reconstruction at multiple resolutions. With comparable or better performance than standard CNNs for image reconstruction, LoFi achieves excellent generalization to out-of-distribution data and memory usage almost independent of image resolution. Remarkably, training on $1024 \times 1024$ images requires just 3GB of memory -- over 20 times less than the memory typically needed by standard CNNs. Additionally, LoFi's local design allows it to train on extremely small datasets with less than 10 samples, without overfitting or the need for regularization or early stopping. Finally, we use LoFi as a denoising prior in a plug-and-play framework for solving general inverse problems to benefit from its continuous image representation and strong generalization. Although trained on low-resolution images, LoFi can be used as a low-dimensional prior to solve inverse problems at any resolution. We validate our framework across a variety of imaging modalities, from low-dose computed tomography to radio interferometric imaging.</description>

      <title>LLM2CLIP: Powerful Language Model Unlock Richer Visual Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CLIP is one of the most important multimodal foundational models today. What powers CLIP's capabilities? The rich supervision signals provided by natural language, the carrier of human knowledge, shape a powerful cross-modal representation space. However, with the rapid advancements in large language models LLMs like GPT-4 and LLaMA, the boundaries of language comprehension and generation are continually being pushed. This raises an intriguing question: can the capabilities of LLMs be harnessed to further improve multimodal representation learning? The potential benefits of incorporating LLMs into CLIP are clear. LLMs' strong textual understanding can fundamentally improve CLIP's ability to handle image captions, drastically enhancing its ability to process long and complex texts, a well-known limitation of vanilla CLIP. Moreover, LLMs are trained on a vast corpus of text, possessing open-world knowledge. This allows them to expand on caption information during training, increasing the efficiency of the learning process. In this paper, we propose LLM2CLIP, a novel approach that embraces the power of LLMs to unlock CLIP's potential. By fine-tuning the LLM in the caption space with contrastive learning, we extract its textual capabilities into the output embeddings, significantly improving the output layer's textual discriminability. We then design an efficient training process where the fine-tuned LLM acts as a powerful teacher for CLIP's visual encoder. Thanks to the LLM's presence, we can now incorporate longer and more complex captions without being restricted by vanilla CLIP's text encoder's context window and ability limitations. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach brings substantial improvements in cross-modal tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present HourVideo, a benchmark dataset for hour-long video-language understanding. Our dataset consists of a novel task suite comprising summarization, perception (recall, tracking), visual reasoning (spatial, temporal, predictive, causal, counterfactual), and navigation (room-to-room, object retrieval) tasks. HourVideo includes 500 manually curated egocentric videos from the Ego4D dataset, spanning durations of 20 to 120 minutes, and features 12,976 high-quality, five-way multiple-choice questions. Benchmarking results reveal that multimodal models, including GPT-4 and LLaVA-NeXT, achieve marginal improvements over random chance. In stark contrast, human experts significantly outperform the state-of-the-art long-context multimodal model, Gemini Pro 1.5 (85.0% vs. 37.3%), highlighting a substantial gap in multimodal capabilities. Our benchmark, evaluation toolkit, prompts, and documentation are available at https://hourvideo.stanford.edu</description>

      <title>Analyzing The Language of Visual Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the introduction of transformer-based models for vision and language tasks, such as LLaVA and Chameleon, there has been renewed interest in the discrete tokenized representation of images. These models often treat image patches as discrete tokens, analogous to words in natural language, learning joint alignments between visual and human languages. However, little is known about the statistical behavior of these visual languages - whether they follow similar frequency distributions, grammatical structures, or topologies as natural languages. In this paper, we take a natural-language-centric approach to analyzing discrete visual languages and uncover striking similarities and fundamental differences. We demonstrate that, although visual languages adhere to Zipfian distributions, higher token innovation drives greater entropy and lower compression, with tokens predominantly representing object parts, indicating intermediate granularity. We also show that visual languages lack cohesive grammatical structures, leading to higher perplexity and weaker hierarchical organization compared to natural languages. Finally, we demonstrate that, while vision models align more closely with natural languages than other models, this alignment remains significantly weaker than the cohesion found within natural languages. Through these experiments, we demonstrate how understanding the statistical properties of discrete visual languages can inform the design of more effective computer vision models.</description>

      <title>ReCapture: Generative Video Camera Controls for User-Provided Videos using Masked Video Fine-Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, breakthroughs in video modeling have allowed for controllable camera trajectories in generated videos. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to user-provided videos that are not generated by a video model. In this paper, we present ReCapture, a method for generating new videos with novel camera trajectories from a single user-provided video. Our method allows us to re-generate the reference video, with all its existing scene motion, from vastly different angles and with cinematic camera motion. Notably, using our method we can also plausibly hallucinate parts of the scene that were not observable in the reference video. Our method works by (1) generating a noisy anchor video with a new camera trajectory using multiview diffusion models or depth-based point cloud rendering and then (2) regenerating the anchor video into a clean and temporally consistent reangled video using our proposed masked video fine-tuning technique.</description>

      <title>Diff-2-in-1: Bridging Generation and Dense Perception with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond high-fidelity image synthesis, diffusion models have recently exhibited promising results in dense visual perception tasks. However, most existing work treats diffusion models as a standalone component for perception tasks, employing them either solely for off-the-shelf data augmentation or as mere feature extractors. In contrast to these isolated and thus sub-optimal efforts, we introduce a unified, versatile, diffusion-based framework, Diff-2-in-1, that can simultaneously handle both multi-modal data generation and dense visual perception, through a unique exploitation of the diffusion-denoising process. Within this framework, we further enhance discriminative visual perception via multi-modal generation, by utilizing the denoising network to create multi-modal data that mirror the distribution of the original training set. Importantly, Diff-2-in-1 optimizes the utilization of the created diverse and faithful data by leveraging a novel self-improving learning mechanism. Comprehensive experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing consistent performance improvements across various discriminative backbones and high-quality multi-modal data generation characterized by both realism and usefulness.</description>

      <title>ProEdit: Simple Progression is All You Need for High-Quality 3D Scene Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes ProEdit - a simple yet effective framework for high-quality 3D scene editing guided by diffusion distillation in a novel progressive manner. Inspired by the crucial observation that multi-view inconsistency in scene editing is rooted in the diffusion model's large feasible output space (FOS), our framework controls the size of FOS and reduces inconsistency by decomposing the overall editing task into several subtasks, which are then executed progressively on the scene. Within this framework, we design a difficulty-aware subtask decomposition scheduler and an adaptive 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) training strategy, ensuring high quality and efficiency in performing each subtask. Extensive evaluation shows that our ProEdit achieves state-of-the-art results in various scenes and challenging editing tasks, all through a simple framework without any expensive or sophisticated add-ons like distillation losses, components, or training procedures. Notably, ProEdit also provides a new way to control, preview, and select the "aggressivity" of editing operation during the editing process.</description>

      <title>SVDQunat: Absorbing Outliers by Low-Rank Components for 4-Bit Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been proven highly effective at generating high-quality images. However, as these models grow larger, they require significantly more memory and suffer from higher latency, posing substantial challenges for deployment. In this work, we aim to accelerate diffusion models by quantizing their weights and activations to 4 bits. At such an aggressive level, both weights and activations are highly sensitive, where conventional post-training quantization methods for large language models like smoothing become insufficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose SVDQuant, a new 4-bit quantization paradigm. Different from smoothing which redistributes outliers between weights and activations, our approach absorbs these outliers using a low-rank branch. We first consolidate the outliers by shifting them from activations to weights, then employ a high-precision low-rank branch to take in the weight outliers with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This process eases the quantization on both sides. However, na\"{\i}vely running the low-rank branch independently incurs significant overhead due to extra data movement of activations, negating the quantization speedup. To address this, we co-design an inference engine Nunchaku that fuses the kernels of the low-rank branch into those of the low-bit branch to cut off redundant memory access. It can also seamlessly support off-the-shelf low-rank adapters (LoRAs) without the need for re-quantization. Extensive experiments on SDXL, PixArt-$\Sigma$, and FLUX.1 validate the effectiveness of SVDQuant in preserving image quality. We reduce the memory usage for the 12B FLUX.1 models by 3.5$\times$, achieving 3.0$\times$ speedup over the 4-bit weight-only quantized baseline on the 16GB laptop 4090 GPU, paving the way for more interactive applications on PCs. Our quantization library and inference engine are open-sourced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the extent of urban flooding is crucial for assessing building damage, casualties and economic losses. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology offers significant advantages for mapping flooded urban areas due to its ability to collect data regardless weather and solar illumination conditions. However, the wide range of existing methods makes it difficult to choose the best approach for a specific situation and to identify future research directions. Therefore, this study provides a comprehensive review of current research on urban flood mapping using SAR data, summarizing key characteristics of floodwater in SAR images and outlining various approaches from scientific articles. Additionally, we provide a brief overview of the advantages and disadvantages of each method category, along with guidance on selecting the most suitable approach for different scenarios. This study focuses on the challenges and advancements in SAR-based urban flood mapping. It specifically addresses the limitations of spatial and temporal resolution in SAR data and discusses the essential pre-processing steps. Moreover, the article explores the potential benefits of Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) techniques and uncertainty analysis for future research. Furthermore, it highlights a lack of open-access SAR datasets for urban flood mapping, hindering development in advanced deep learning-based methods. Besides, we evaluated the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) of urban flood mapping techniques to identify challenges and future research areas. Finally, the study explores the practical applications of SAR-based urban flood mapping in both the private and public sectors and provides a comprehensive overview of the benefits and potential impact of these methods.</description>

      <title>MINDSETS: Multi-omics Integration with Neuroimaging for Dementia Subtyping and Effective Temporal Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the complex realm of cognitive disorders, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are the two most prevalent dementia types, presenting entangled symptoms yet requiring distinct treatment approaches. The crux of effective treatment in slowing neurodegeneration lies in early, accurate diagnosis, as this significantly assists doctors in determining the appropriate course of action. However, current diagnostic practices often delay VaD diagnosis, impeding timely intervention and adversely affecting patient prognosis. This paper presents an innovative multi-omics approach to accurately differentiate AD from VaD, achieving a diagnostic accuracy of 89.25%. The proposed method segments the longitudinal MRI scans and extracts advanced radiomics features. Subsequently, it synergistically integrates the radiomics features with an ensemble of clinical, cognitive, and genetic data to provide state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy, setting a new benchmark in classification accuracy on a large public dataset. The paper's primary contribution is proposing a comprehensive methodology utilizing multi-omics data to provide a nuanced understanding of dementia subtypes. Additionally, the paper introduces an interpretable model to enhance clinical decision-making coupled with a novel model architecture for evaluating treatment efficacy. These advancements lay the groundwork for future work not only aimed at improving differential diagnosis but also mitigating and preventing the progression of dementia.</description>

      <title>Unfair Alignment: Examining Safety Alignment Across Vision Encoder Layers in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have improved significantly in multi-modal tasks, but their more complex architecture makes their safety alignment more challenging than the alignment of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we reveal an unfair distribution of safety across the layers of VLM's vision encoder, with earlier and middle layers being disproportionately vulnerable to malicious inputs compared to the more robust final layers. This 'cross-layer' vulnerability stems from the model's inability to generalize its safety training from the default architectural settings used during training to unseen or out-of-distribution scenarios, leaving certain layers exposed. We conduct a comprehensive analysis by projecting activations from various intermediate layers and demonstrate that these layers are more likely to generate harmful outputs when exposed to malicious inputs. Our experiments with LLaVA-1.5 and Llama 3.2 show discrepancies in attack success rates and toxicity scores across layers, indicating that current safety alignment strategies focused on a single default layer are insufficient.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Bronchoscopy Depth Estimation through Synthetic-to-Real Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has shown promise in general imaging tasks, aiding in localization and 3D reconstruction. While effective in various domains, its application to bronchoscopic images is hindered by the lack of labeled data, challenging the use of supervised learning methods. In this work, we propose a transfer learning framework that leverages synthetic data with depth labels for training and adapts domain knowledge for accurate depth estimation in real bronchoscope data. Our network demonstrates improved depth prediction on real footage using domain adaptation compared to training solely on synthetic data, validating our approach.</description>

      <title>Continuous Sign Language Recognition System using Deep Learning with MediaPipe Holistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sign languages are the language of hearing-impaired people who use visuals like the hand, facial, and body movements for communication. There are different signs and gestures representing alphabets, words, and phrases. Nowadays approximately 300 sign languages are being practiced worldwide such as American Sign Language (ASL), Chinese Sign Language (CSL), Indian Sign Language (ISL), and many more. Sign languages are dependent on the vocal language of a place. Unlike vocal or spoken languages, there are no helping words in sign language like is, am, are, was, were, will, be, etc. As only a limited population is well-versed in sign language, this lack of familiarity of sign language hinders hearing-impaired people from communicating freely and easily with everyone. This issue can be addressed by a sign language recognition (SLR) system which has the capability to translate the sign language into vocal language. In this paper, a continuous SLR system is proposed using a deep learning model employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), trained and tested on an ISL primary dataset. This dataset is created using MediaPipe Holistic pipeline for tracking face, hand, and body movements and collecting landmarks. The system recognizes the signs and gestures in real-time with 88.23% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Verification of Neural Networks against Convolutional Perturbations via Parameterised Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a method for the efficient verification of neural networks against convolutional perturbations such as blurring or sharpening. To define input perturbations we use well-known camera shake, box blur and sharpen kernels. We demonstrate that these kernels can be linearly parameterised in a way that allows for a variation of the perturbation strength while preserving desired kernel properties. To facilitate their use in neural network verification, we develop an efficient way of convolving a given input with these parameterised kernels. The result of this convolution can be used to encode the perturbation in a verification setting by prepending a linear layer to a given network. This leads to tight bounds and a high effectiveness in the resulting verification step. We add further precision by employing input splitting as a branch and bound strategy. We demonstrate that we are able to verify robustness on a number of standard benchmarks where the baseline is unable to provide any safety certificates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solution for verifying robustness against specific convolutional perturbations such as camera shake.</description>

      <title>TexLiverNet: Leveraging Medical Knowledge and Spatial-Frequency Perception for Enhanced Liver Tumor Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating textual data with imaging in liver tumor segmentation is essential for enhancing diagnostic accuracy. However, current multi-modal medical datasets offer only general text annotations, lacking lesion-specific details critical for extracting nuanced features, especially for fine-grained segmentation of tumor boundaries and small lesions. To address these limitations, we developed datasets with lesion-specific text annotations for liver tumors and introduced the TexLiverNet model. TexLiverNet employs an agent-based cross-attention module that integrates text features efficiently with visual features, significantly reducing computational costs. Additionally, enhanced spatial and adaptive frequency domain perception is proposed to precisely delineate lesion boundaries, reduce background interference, and recover fine details in small lesions. Comprehensive evaluations on public and private datasets demonstrate that TexLiverNet achieves superior performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>CaPo: Cooperative Plan Optimization for Efficient Embodied Multi-Agent Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the cooperation problem among large language model (LLM) based embodied agents, where agents must cooperate to achieve a common goal. Previous methods often execute actions extemporaneously and incoherently, without long-term strategic and cooperative planning, leading to redundant steps, failures, and even serious repercussions in complex tasks like search-and-rescue missions where discussion and cooperative plan are crucial. To solve this issue, we propose Cooperative Plan Optimization (CaPo) to enhance the cooperation efficiency of LLM-based embodied agents. Inspired by human cooperation schemes, CaPo improves cooperation efficiency with two phases: 1) meta-plan generation, and 2) progress-adaptive meta-plan and execution. In the first phase, all agents analyze the task, discuss, and cooperatively create a meta-plan that decomposes the task into subtasks with detailed steps, ensuring a long-term strategic and coherent plan for efficient coordination. In the second phase, agents execute tasks according to the meta-plan and dynamically adjust it based on their latest progress (e.g., discovering a target object) through multi-turn discussions. This progress-based adaptation eliminates redundant actions, improving the overall cooperation efficiency of agents. Experimental results on the ThreeDworld Multi-Agent Transport and Communicative Watch-And-Help tasks demonstrate that CaPo achieves much higher task completion rate and efficiency compared with state-of-the-arts.</description>

      <title>Subspace-Constrained Quadratic Matrix Factorization: Algorithm and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix Factorization has emerged as a widely adopted framework for modeling data exhibiting low-rank structures. To address challenges in manifold learning, this paper presents a subspace-constrained quadratic matrix factorization model. The model is designed to jointly learn key low-dimensional structures, including the tangent space, the normal subspace, and the quadratic form that links the tangent space to a low-dimensional representation. We solve the proposed factorization model using an alternating minimization method, involving an in-depth investigation of nonlinear regression and projection subproblems. Theoretical properties of the quadratic projection problem and convergence characteristics of the alternating strategy are also investigated. To validate our approach, we conduct numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. Results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods, highlighting its robustness and efficacy in capturing core low-dimensional structures.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Stability Gap in Continual Learning: The Role of the Classification Head</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a critical area in machine learning, enabling neural networks to learn from evolving data distributions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. However, recent research has identified the stability gap -- a phenomenon where models initially lose performance on previously learned tasks before partially recovering during training. Such learning dynamics are contradictory to the intuitive understanding of stability in continual learning where one would expect the performance to degrade gradually instead of rapidly decreasing and then partially recovering later. To better understand and alleviate the stability gap, we investigate it at different levels of the neural network architecture, particularly focusing on the role of the classification head. We introduce the nearest-mean classifier (NMC) as a tool to attribute the influence of the backbone and the classification head on the stability gap. Our experiments demonstrate that NMC not only improves final performance, but also significantly enhances training stability across various continual learning benchmarks, including CIFAR100, ImageNet100, CUB-200, and FGVC Aircrafts. Moreover, we find that NMC also reduces task-recency bias. Our analysis provides new insights into the stability gap and suggests that the primary contributor to this phenomenon is the linear head, rather than the insufficient representation learning.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Differentiable Logic Gate Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing inference cost of machine learning models, there is a growing interest in models with fast and efficient inference. Recently, an approach for learning logic gate networks directly via a differentiable relaxation was proposed. Logic gate networks are faster than conventional neural network approaches because their inference only requires logic gate operators such as NAND, OR, and XOR, which are the underlying building blocks of current hardware and can be efficiently executed. We build on this idea, extending it by deep logic gate tree convolutions, logical OR pooling, and residual initializations. This allows scaling logic gate networks up by over one order of magnitude and utilizing the paradigm of convolution. On CIFAR-10, we achieve an accuracy of 86.29% using only 61 million logic gates, which improves over the SOTA while being 29x smaller.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSI) glomerulus segmentation is essential for accurately diagnosing kidney diseases. In this work, we propose a practical pipeline for glomerulus segmentation that effectively enhances both patch-level and WSI-level segmentation tasks. Our approach leverages stitching on overlapping patches, increasing the detection coverage, especially when glomeruli are located near patch image borders. In addition, we conduct comprehensive evaluations from different segmentation models across two large and diverse datasets with over 30K glomerulus annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that models using our pipeline outperform the previous state-of-the-art method, achieving superior results across both datasets and setting a new benchmark for glomerulus segmentation in WSIs. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/huuquan1994/wsi_glomerulus_seg.</description>

      <title>MPVO: Motion-Prior based Visual Odometry for PointGoal Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual odometry (VO) is essential for enabling accurate point-goal navigation of embodied agents in indoor environments where GPS and compass sensors are unreliable and inaccurate. However, traditional VO methods face challenges in wide-baseline scenarios, where fast robot motions and low frames per second (FPS) during inference hinder their performance, leading to drift and catastrophic failures in point-goal navigation. Recent deep-learned VO methods show robust performance but suffer from sample inefficiency during training; hence, they require huge datasets and compute resources. So, we propose a robust and sample-efficient VO pipeline based on motion priors available while an agent is navigating an environment. It consists of a training-free action-prior based geometric VO module that estimates a coarse relative pose which is further consumed as a motion prior by a deep-learned VO model, which finally produces a fine relative pose to be used by the navigation policy. This strategy helps our pipeline achieve up to 2x sample efficiency during training and demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness in point-goal navigation tasks compared to state-of-the-art VO method(s). Realistic indoor environments of the Gibson dataset is used in the AI-Habitat simulator to evaluate the proposed approach using navigation metrics (like success/SPL) and pose metrics (like RPE/ATE). We hope this method further opens a direction of work where motion priors from various sources can be utilized to improve VO estimates and achieve better results in embodied navigation tasks.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Gaussian Representation for Incomplete CT Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incomplete Computed Tomography (CT) benefits patients by reducing radiation exposure. However, reconstructing high-fidelity images from limited views or angles remains challenging due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Deep Learning Reconstruction (DLR) methods have shown promise in enhancing image quality, but the paradox between training data diversity and high generalization ability remains unsolved. In this paper, we propose a novel Gaussian Representation for Incomplete CT Reconstruction (GRCT) without the usage of any neural networks or full-dose CT data. Specifically, we model the 3D volume as a set of learnable Gaussians, which are optimized directly from the incomplete sinogram. Our method can be applied to multiple views and angles without changing the architecture. Additionally, we propose a differentiable Fast CT Reconstruction method for efficient clinical usage. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and settings demonstrate significant improvements in reconstruction quality metrics and high efficiency. We plan to release our code as open-source.</description>

      <title>Stem-OB: Generalizable Visual Imitation Learning with Stem-Like Convergent Observation through Diffusion Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual imitation learning methods demonstrate strong performance, yet they lack generalization when faced with visual input perturbations, including variations in lighting and textures, impeding their real-world application. We propose Stem-OB that utilizes pretrained image diffusion models to suppress low-level visual differences while maintaining high-level scene structures. This image inversion process is akin to transforming the observation into a shared representation, from which other observations stem, with extraneous details removed. Stem-OB contrasts with data-augmentation approaches as it is robust to various unspecified appearance changes without the need for additional training. Our method is a simple yet highly effective plug-and-play solution. Empirical results confirm the effectiveness of our approach in simulated tasks and show an exceptionally significant improvement in real-world applications, with an average increase of 22.2% in success rates compared to the best baseline.

Abstract: Training deep-learning-based vision systems require the manual annotation of a significant number of images. Such manual annotation is highly time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although previous studies have attempted to eliminate the effort required for annotation, the effort required for image collection was retained. To address this, we propose a human-in-the-loop dataset collection method that uses a web application. To counterbalance the workload and performance by encouraging the collection of multi-view object image datasets in an enjoyable manner, thereby amplifying motivation, we propose three types of online visual feedback features to track the progress of the collection status. Our experiments thoroughly investigated the impact of each feature on collection performance and quality of operation. The results suggested the feasibility of annotation and object detection.</description>

      <title>Local Padding in Patch-Based GANs for Seamless Infinite-Sized Texture Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02340v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Texture models based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) use zero-padding to implicitly encode positional information of the image features. However, when extending the spatial input to generate images at large sizes, zero-padding can often lead to degradation in image quality due to the incorrect positional information at the center of the image. Moreover, zero-padding can limit the diversity within the generated large images. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating stochastic texture images at large arbitrary sizes using GANs based on patch-by-patch generation. Instead of zero-padding, the model uses \textit{local padding} in the generator that shares border features between the generated patches; providing positional context and ensuring consistency at the boundaries. The proposed models are trainable on a single texture image and have a constant GPU scalability with respect to the output image size, and hence can generate images of infinite sizes. We show in the experiments that our method has a significant advancement beyond existing GANs-based texture models in terms of the quality and diversity of the generated textures. Furthermore, the implementation of local padding in the state-of-the-art super-resolution models effectively eliminates tiling artifacts enabling large-scale super-resolution.

      <title>Aligning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Reward Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03739v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have recently emerged at the forefront of image generation, powered by very large-scale unsupervised or weakly supervised text-to-image training datasets. Due to their unsupervised training, controlling their behavior in downstream tasks, such as maximizing human-perceived image quality, image-text alignment, or ethical image generation, is difficult. Recent works finetune diffusion models to downstream reward functions using vanilla reinforcement learning, notorious for the high variance of the gradient estimators. In this paper, we propose AlignProp, a method that aligns diffusion models to downstream reward functions using end-to-end backpropagation of the reward gradient through the denoising process. While naive implementation of such backpropagation would require prohibitive memory resources for storing the partial derivatives of modern text-to-image models, AlignProp finetunes low-rank adapter weight modules and uses gradient checkpointing, to render its memory usage viable. We test AlignProp in finetuning diffusion models to various objectives, such as image-text semantic alignment, aesthetics, compressibility and controllability of the number of objects present, as well as their combinations. We show AlignProp achieves higher rewards in fewer training steps than alternatives, while being conceptually simpler, making it a straightforward choice for optimizing diffusion models for differentiable reward functions of interest.

      <description>arXiv:2312.02548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data augmentation is crucial in training deep models, preventing them from overfitting to limited data. Recent advances in generative AI, e.g., diffusion models, have enabled more sophisticated augmentation techniques that produce data resembling natural images. We introduce GeNIe a novel augmentation method which leverages a latent diffusion model conditioned on a text prompt to combine two contrasting data points (an image from the source category and a text prompt from the target category) to generate challenging augmentations. To achieve this, we adjust the noise level (equivalently, number of diffusion iterations) to ensure the generated image retains low-level and background features from the source image while representing the target category, resulting in a hard negative sample for the source category. We further automate and enhance GeNIe by adaptively adjusting the noise level selection on a per image basis (coined as GeNIe-Ada), leading to further performance improvements. Our extensive experiments, in both few-shot and long-tail distribution settings, demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel augmentation method and its superior performance over the prior art.

      <title>FocalPose++: Focal Length and Object Pose Estimation via Render and Compare</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce FocalPose++, a neural render-and-compare method for jointly estimating the camera-object 6D pose and camera focal length given a single RGB input image depicting a known object. The contributions of this work are threefold. First, we derive a focal length update rule that extends an existing state-of-the-art render-and-compare 6D pose estimator to address the joint estimation task. Second, we investigate several different loss functions for jointly estimating the object pose and focal length. We find that a combination of direct focal length regression with a reprojection loss disentangling the contribution of translation, rotation, and focal length leads to improved results. Third, we explore the effect of different synthetic training data on the performance of our method. Specifically, we investigate different distributions used for sampling object's 6D pose and camera's focal length when rendering the synthetic images, and show that parametric distribution fitted on real training data works the best. We show results on three challenging benchmark datasets that depict known 3D models in uncontrolled settings. We demonstrate that our focal length and 6D pose estimates have lower error than the existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Transferable Learned Image Compression-Resistant Adversarial Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks can readily disrupt the image classification system, revealing the vulnerability of DNN-based recognition tasks. While existing adversarial perturbations are primarily applied to uncompressed images or compressed images by the traditional image compression method, i.e., JPEG, limited studies have investigated the robustness of models for image classification in the context of DNN-based image compression. With the rapid evolution of advanced image compression, DNN-based learned image compression has emerged as the promising approach for transmitting images in many security-critical applications, such as cloud-based face recognition and autonomous driving, due to its superior performance over traditional compression. Therefore, there is a pressing need to fully investigate the robustness of a classification system post-processed by learned image compression. To bridge this research gap, we explore the adversarial attack on a new pipeline that targets image classification models that utilize learned image compressors as pre-processing modules. Furthermore, to enhance the transferability of perturbations across various quality levels and architectures of learned image compression models, we introduce a saliency score-based sampling method to enable the fast generation of transferable perturbation. Extensive experiments with popular attack methods demonstrate the enhanced transferability of our proposed method when attacking images that have been post-processed with different learned image compression models.</description>

      <title>TaE: Task-aware Expandable Representation for Long Tail Class Incremental Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Class-incremental learning is dedicated to the development of deep learning models that are capable of acquiring new knowledge while retaining previously learned information. Most methods focus on balanced data distribution for each task, overlooking real-world long-tailed distributions. Therefore, Long-Tailed Class-Incremental Learning has been introduced, which trains on data where head classes have more samples than tail classes. Existing methods mainly focus on preserving representative samples from previous classes to combat catastrophic forgetting. Recently, dynamic network algorithms freeze old network structures and expand new ones, achieving significant performance. However, with the introduction of the long-tail problem, merely extending Determined blocks can lead to miscalibrated predictions, while expanding the entire backbone results in an explosion of memory size. To address these issues, we introduce a novel Task-aware Expandable (TaE) framework, dynamically allocating and updating task-specific trainable parameters to learn diverse representations from each incremental task while resisting forgetting through the majority of frozen model parameters. To further encourage the class-specific feature representation, we develop a Centroid-Enhanced (CEd) method to guide the update of these task-aware parameters. This approach is designed to adaptively allocate feature space for every class by adjusting the distance between intra- and inter-class features, which can extend to all "training from sketch" algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TaE achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Representing Domain-Mixing Optical Degradation for Real-World Computational Aberration Correction via Vector Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relying on paired synthetic data, existing learning-based Computational Aberration Correction (CAC) methods are confronted with the intricate and multifaceted synthetic-to-real domain gap, which leads to suboptimal performance in real-world applications. In this paper, in contrast to improving the simulation pipeline, we deliver a novel insight into real-world CAC from the perspective of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). By incorporating readily accessible unpaired real-world data into training, we formalize the Domain Adaptive CAC (DACAC) task, and then introduce a comprehensive Real-world aberrated images (Realab) dataset to benchmark it. The setup task presents a formidable challenge due to the intricacy of understanding the target optical degradation domain. To this intent, we propose a novel Quantized Domain-Mixing Representation (QDMR) framework as a potent solution to the issue. Centering around representing and quantizing the optical degradation which is consistent across different images, QDMR adapts the CAC model to the target domain from three key aspects: (1) reconstructing aberrated images of both domains by a VQGAN to learn a Domain-Mixing Codebook (DMC) characterizing the optical degradation; (2) modulating the deep features in CAC model with DMC to transfer the target domain knowledge; and (3) leveraging the trained VQGAN to generate pseudo target aberrated images from the source ones for convincing target domain supervision. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks reveal that the models with QDMR consistently surpass the competitive methods in mitigating the synthetic-to-real gap, which produces visually pleasant real-world CAC results with fewer artifacts.

      <description>arXiv:2403.17822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity 3D reconstruction of common indoor scenes is crucial for VR and AR applications. 3D Gaussian splatting, a novel differentiable rendering technique, has achieved state-of-the-art novel view synthesis results with high rendering speeds and relatively low training times. However, its performance on scenes commonly seen in indoor datasets is poor due to the lack of geometric constraints during optimization. In this work, we explore the use of readily accessible geometric cues to enhance Gaussian splatting optimization in challenging, ill-posed, and textureless scenes. We extend 3D Gaussian splatting with depth and normal cues to tackle challenging indoor datasets and showcase techniques for efficient mesh extraction. Specifically, we regularize the optimization procedure with depth information, enforce local smoothness of nearby Gaussians, and use off-the-shelf monocular networks to achieve better alignment with the true scene geometry. We propose an adaptive depth loss based on the gradient of color images, improving depth estimation and novel view synthesis results over various baselines. Our simple yet effective regularization technique enables direct mesh extraction from the Gaussian representation, yielding more physically accurate reconstructions of indoor scenes.</description>

      <title>Learning Multiple Object States from Actions via Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recognizing the states of objects in a video is crucial in understanding the scene beyond actions and objects. For instance, an egg can be raw, cracked, and whisked while cooking an omelet, and these states can coexist simultaneously (an egg can be both raw and whisked). However, most existing research assumes a single object state change (e.g., uncracked -&gt; cracked), overlooking the coexisting nature of multiple object states and the influence of past states on the current state. We formulate object state recognition as a multi-label classification task that explicitly handles multiple states. We then propose to learn multiple object states from narrated videos by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate pseudo-labels from the transcribed narrations, capturing the influence of past states. The challenge is that narrations mostly describe human actions in the video but rarely explain object states. Therefore, we use the LLMs knowledge of the relationship between actions and states to derive the missing object states. We further accumulate the derived object states to consider past state contexts to infer current object state pseudo-labels. We newly collect a dataset called the Multiple Object States Transition (MOST) dataset, which includes manual multi-label annotation for evaluation purposes, covering 60 object states across six object categories. Experimental results show that our model trained on LLM-generated pseudo-labels significantly outperforms strong vision-language models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our pseudo-labeling framework that considers past context via LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09032v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in the field of handwritten mathematical expression recognition, while existing encoder-decoder methods are usually difficult to model global information in $LaTeX$. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel approach, Implicit Character-Aided Learning (ICAL), to mine the global expression information and enhance handwritten mathematical expression recognition. Specifically, we propose the Implicit Character Construction Module (ICCM) to predict implicit character sequences and use a Fusion Module to merge the outputs of the ICCM and the decoder, thereby producing corrected predictions. By modeling and utilizing implicit character information, ICAL achieves a more accurate and context-aware interpretation of handwritten mathematical expressions. Experimental results demonstrate that ICAL notably surpasses the state-of-the-art(SOTA) models, improving the expression recognition rate (ExpRate) by 2.25\%/1.81\%/1.39\% on the CROHME 2014/2016/2019 datasets respectively, and achieves a remarkable 69.06\% on the challenging HME100k test set.

      <description>arXiv:2405.14974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Question answering, asking, and assessment are three innate human traits crucial for understanding the world and acquiring knowledge. By enhancing these capabilities, humans can more effectively utilize data, leading to better comprehension and learning outcomes. Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) primarily focus on question answering, often neglecting the full potential of questioning and assessment skills. Inspired by the human learning mechanism, we introduce LOVA3, an innovative framework named "Learning tO Visual question Answering, Asking and Assessment," designed to equip MLLMs with these additional capabilities. Our approach involves the creation of two supplementary training tasks GenQA and EvalQA, aiming at fostering the skills of asking and assessing questions in the context of images. To develop the questioning ability, we compile a comprehensive set of multimodal foundational tasks. For assessment, we introduce a new benchmark called EvalQABench, comprising 64,000 training samples (split evenly between positive and negative samples) and 5,000 validation and testing samples. We posit that enhancing MLLMs with the capabilities to answer, ask, and assess questions will enhance their multimodal comprehension, ultimately improving overall performance. To validate this hypothesis, we train MLLMs using the LOVA3 framework and evaluate them on a range of multimodal datasets and benchmarks. Our results demonstrate consistent performance gains, underscoring the critical role of these additional tasks in fostering comprehensive intelligence in MLLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/showlab/LOVA3.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language foundational models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated significant strides in zero-shot classification. However, the extensive parameterization of models like CLIP necessitates a resource-intensive fine-tuning process. In response, TIP-Adapter and SuS-X have introduced training-free methods aimed at bolstering the efficacy of downstream tasks. While these approaches incorporate support sets to maintain data distribution consistency between knowledge cache and test sets, they often fall short in terms of generalization on the test set, particularly when faced with test data exhibiting substantial distributional variations. In this work, we present CapS-Adapter, an innovative method that employs a caption-based support set, effectively harnessing both image and caption features to exceed existing state-of-the-art techniques in training-free scenarios. CapS-Adapter adeptly constructs support sets that closely mirror target distributions, utilizing instance-level distribution features extracted from multimodal large models. By leveraging CLIP's single and cross-modal strengths, CapS-Adapter enhances predictive accuracy through the use of multimodal support sets. Our method achieves outstanding zero-shot classification results across 19 benchmark datasets, improving accuracy by 2.19\% over the previous leading method. Our contributions are substantiated through extensive validation on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance and robust generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Introducing training-time augmentations is a key technique to enhance generalization and prepare deep neural networks against test-time corruptions. Inspired by the success of generative diffusion models, we propose a novel approach of coupling data mollification, in the form of image noising and blurring, with label smoothing to align predicted label confidences with image degradation. The method is simple to implement, introduces negligible overheads, and can be combined with existing augmentations. We demonstrate improved robustness and uncertainty quantification on the corrupted image benchmarks of the CIFAR and TinyImageNet datasets.</description>

      <title>Controllable Talking Face Generation by Implicit Facial Keypoints Editing</title>

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has garnered significant interest within the domain of digital human research. Existing methods are encumbered by intricate model architectures that are intricately dependent on each other, complicating the process of re-editing image or video inputs. In this work, we present ControlTalk, a talking face generation method to control face expression deformation based on driven audio, which can construct the head pose and facial expression including lip motion for both single image or sequential video inputs in a unified manner. By utilizing a pre-trained video synthesis renderer and proposing the lightweight adaptation, ControlTalk achieves precise and naturalistic lip synchronization while enabling quantitative control over mouth opening shape. Our experiments show that our method is superior to state-of-the-art performance on widely used benchmarks, including HDTF and MEAD. The parameterized adaptation demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities, effectively handling expression deformation across same-ID and cross-ID scenarios, and extending its utility to out-of-domain portraits, regardless of languages.

      <title>C3T: Cross-modal Transfer Through Time for Human Action Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to unlock the potential of diverse sensors, we investigate a method to transfer knowledge between modalities using the structure of a unified multimodal representation space for Human Action Recognition (HAR). We formalize and explore an understudied cross-modal transfer setting we term Unsupervised Modality Adaptation (UMA), where the modality used in testing is not used in supervised training, i.e. zero labeled instances of the test modality are available during training. We develop three methods to perform UMA: Student-Teacher (ST), Contrastive Alignment (CA), and Cross-modal Transfer Through Time (C3T). Our extensive experiments on various camera+IMU datasets compare these methods to each other in the UMA setting, and to their empirical upper bound in the supervised setting. The results indicate C3T is the most robust and highest performing by at least a margin of 8%, and nears the supervised setting performance even in the presence of temporal noise. This method introduces a novel mechanism for aligning signals across time-varying latent vectors, extracted from the receptive field of temporal convolutions. Our findings suggest that C3T has significant potential for developing generalizable models for time-series sensor data, opening new avenues for multi-modal learning in various applications.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Surgical Instrument Segmentation Without Human Intervention: A Graph Partitioning View</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surgical instrument segmentation (SIS) on endoscopic images stands as a long-standing and essential task in the context of computer-assisted interventions for boosting minimally invasive surgery. Given the recent surge of deep learning methodologies and their data-hungry nature, training a neural predictive model based on massive expert-curated annotations has been dominating and served as an off-the-shelf approach in the field, which could, however, impose prohibitive burden to clinicians for preparing fine-grained pixel-wise labels corresponding to the collected surgical video frames. In this work, we propose an unsupervised method by reframing the video frame segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and regarding image pixels as graph nodes, which is significantly different from the previous efforts. A self-supervised pre-trained model is firstly leveraged as a feature extractor to capture high-level semantic features. Then, Laplacian matrixs are computed from the features and are eigendecomposed for graph partitioning. On the "deep" eigenvectors, a surgical video frame is meaningfully segmented into different modules such as tools and tissues, providing distinguishable semantic information like locations, classes, and relations. The segmentation problem can then be naturally tackled by applying clustering or threshold on the eigenvectors. Extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets (e.g., EndoVis2017, EndoVis2018, UCL, etc.) for different clinical endpoints. Across all the challenging scenarios, our method demonstrates outstanding performance and robustness higher than unsupervised state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

      <title>Training-free Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval via Weighted Modality Fusion and Similarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04918v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR), which formulates the query as a combination of a reference image and modified text, has emerged as a new form of image search due to its enhanced ability to capture user intent. However, training a CIR model in a supervised manner typically requires labor-intensive collection of (reference image, text modifier, target image) triplets. While existing zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) methods eliminate the need for training on specific downstream datasets, they still require additional pretraining on large-scale image datasets. In this paper, we introduce a training-free approach for ZS-CIR. Our approach, Weighted Modality fusion and similarity for CIR (WeiMoCIR), operates under the assumption that image and text modalities can be effectively combined using a simple weighted average. This allows the query representation to be constructed directly from the reference image and text modifier. To further enhance retrieval performance, we employ multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate image captions for the database images and incorporate these textual captions into the similarity computation by combining them with image information using a weighted average. Our approach is simple, easy to implement, and its effectiveness is validated through experiments on the FashionIQ and CIRR datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/whats2000/WeiMoCIR.</description>

      <title>LightAvatar: Efficient Head Avatar as Dynamic Neural Light Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works have shown that neural radiance fields (NeRFs) on top of parametric models have reached SOTA quality to build photorealistic head avatars from a monocular video. However, one major limitation of the NeRF-based avatars is the slow rendering speed due to the dense point sampling of NeRF, preventing them from broader utility on resource-constrained devices. We introduce LightAvatar, the first head avatar model based on neural light fields (NeLFs). LightAvatar renders an image from 3DMM parameters and a camera pose via a single network forward pass, without using mesh or volume rendering. The proposed approach, while being conceptually appealing, poses a significant challenge towards real-time efficiency and training stability. To resolve them, we introduce dedicated network designs to obtain proper representations for the NeLF model and maintain a low FLOPs budget. Meanwhile, we tap into a distillation-based training strategy that uses a pretrained avatar model as teacher to synthesize abundant pseudo data for training. A warping field network is introduced to correct the fitting error in the real data so that the model can learn better. Extensive experiments suggest that our method can achieve new SOTA image quality quantitatively or qualitatively, while being significantly faster than the counterparts, reporting 174.1 FPS (512x512 resolution) on a consumer-grade GPU (RTX3090) with no customized optimization.</description>

      <title>Learning from Pattern Completion: Self-supervised Controllable Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The human brain exhibits a strong ability to spontaneously associate different visual attributes of the same or similar visual scene, such as associating sketches and graffiti with real-world visual objects, usually without supervising information. In contrast, in the field of artificial intelligence, controllable generation methods like ControlNet heavily rely on annotated training datasets such as depth maps, semantic segmentation maps, and poses, which limits the method's scalability. Inspired by the neural mechanisms that may contribute to the brain's associative power, specifically the cortical modularization and hippocampal pattern completion, here we propose a self-supervised controllable generation (SCG) framework. Firstly, we introduce an equivariant constraint to promote inter-module independence and intra-module correlation in a modular autoencoder network, thereby achieving functional specialization. Subsequently, based on these specialized modules, we employ a self-supervised pattern completion approach for controllable generation training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed modular autoencoder effectively achieves functional specialization, including the modular processing of color, brightness, and edge detection, and exhibits brain-like features including orientation selectivity, color antagonism, and center-surround receptive fields. Through self-supervised training, associative generation capabilities spontaneously emerge in SCG, demonstrating excellent generalization ability to various tasks such as associative generation on painting, sketches, and ancient graffiti. Compared to the previous representative method ControlNet, our proposed approach not only demonstrates superior robustness in more challenging high-noise scenarios but also possesses more promising scalability potential due to its self-supervised manner.Codes are released on Github and Gitee.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Children often suffer wrist trauma in daily life, while they usually need radiologists to analyze and interpret X-ray images before surgical treatment by surgeons. The development of deep learning has enabled neural networks to serve as computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) tools to help doctors and experts in medical image diagnostics. Since YOLOv8 model has obtained the satisfactory success in object detection tasks, it has been applied to various fracture detection. This work introduces four variants of Feature Contexts Excitation-YOLOv8 (FCE-YOLOv8) model, each incorporating a different FCE module (i.e., modules of Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE), Global Context (GC), Gather-Excite (GE), and Gaussian Context Transformer (GCT)) to enhance the model performance. Experimental results on GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset demonstrate that our proposed YOLOv8+GC-M3 model improves the mAP@50 value from 65.78% to 66.32%, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model while reducing inference time. Furthermore, our proposed YOLOv8+SE-M3 model achieves the highest mAP@50 value of 67.07%, exceeding the SOTA performance.

      <title>SpikeBottleNet: Spike-Driven Feature Compression Architecture for Edge-Cloud Co-Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge-cloud co-inference enables efficient deep neural network (DNN) deployment by splitting the architecture between an edge device and cloud server, crucial for resource-constraint edge devices. This approach requires balancing on-device computations and communication costs, often achieved through compressed intermediate feature transmission. Conventional DNN architectures require continuous data processing and floating point activations, leading to considerable energy consumption and increased feature sizes, thus raising transmission costs. This challenge motivates exploring binary, event-driven activations using spiking neural networks (SNNs), known for their extreme energy efficiency. In this research, we propose SpikeBottleNet, a novel architecture for edge-cloud co-inference systems that integrates a spiking neuron model to significantly reduce energy consumption on edge devices. A key innovation of our study is an intermediate feature compression technique tailored for SNNs for efficient feature transmission. This technique leverages a split computing approach to strategically place encoder-decoder bottleneck units within complex deep architectures like ResNet and MobileNet. Experimental results demonstrate that SpikeBottleNet achieves up to 256x bit compression in the final convolutional layer of ResNet, with minimal accuracy loss (0.16%). Additionally, our approach enhances edge device energy efficiency by up to 144x compared to the baseline BottleNet, making it ideal for resource-limited edge devices.</description>

Abstract: Brain tumor detection and classification are critical tasks in medical image analysis, particularly in early-stage diagnosis, where accurate and timely detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. In this study, we apply various statistical and machine learning models to detect and classify brain tumors using brain MRI images. We explore a variety of statistical models including linear, logistic, and Bayesian regressions, and the machine learning models including decision tree, random forest, single-layer perceptron, multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network, and long short-term memory. Our findings show that CNN outperforms other models, achieving the best performance. Additionally, we confirm that the CNN model can also work for multi-class classification, distinguishing between four categories of brain MRI images such as normal, glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumor images. This study demonstrates that machine learning approaches are suitable for brain tumor detection and classification, facilitating real-world medical applications in assisting radiologists with early and accurate diagnosis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in vision-language tasks across a broad spectrum of domains. However, the large model scale and associated high computational costs pose significant challenges for training and deploying MLLMs on consumer-grade GPUs or edge devices, thereby hindering their widespread application. In this work, we introduce Mini-InternVL, a series of MLLMs with parameters ranging from 1B to 4B, which achieves 90% of the performance with only 5% of the parameters. This significant improvement in efficiency and effectiveness makes our models more accessible and applicable in various real-world scenarios. To further promote the adoption of our models, we develop a unified adaptation framework for Mini-InternVL, which enables our models to transfer and outperform specialized models in downstream tasks, including autonomous driving, medical images, and remote sensing. We believe that our study can provide valuable insights and resources to advance the development of efficient and effective MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVL.</description>

      <title>SS3DM: Benchmarking Street-View Surface Reconstruction with a Synthetic 3D Mesh Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing accurate 3D surfaces for street-view scenarios is crucial for applications such as digital entertainment and autonomous driving simulation. However, existing street-view datasets, including KITTI, Waymo, and nuScenes, only offer noisy LiDAR points as ground-truth data for geometric evaluation of reconstructed surfaces. These geometric ground-truths often lack the necessary precision to evaluate surface positions and do not provide data for assessing surface normals. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the SS3DM dataset, comprising precise \textbf{S}ynthetic \textbf{S}treet-view \textbf{3D} \textbf{M}esh models exported from the CARLA simulator. These mesh models facilitate accurate position evaluation and include normal vectors for evaluating surface normal. To simulate the input data in realistic driving scenarios for 3D reconstruction, we virtually drive a vehicle equipped with six RGB cameras and five LiDAR sensors in diverse outdoor scenes. Leveraging this dataset, we establish a benchmark for state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the associated challenges.

      <title>ContextIQ: A Multimodal Expert-Based Video Retrieval System for Contextual Advertising</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contextual advertising serves ads that are aligned to the content that the user is viewing. The rapid growth of video content on social platforms and streaming services, along with privacy concerns, has increased the need for contextual advertising. Placing the right ad in the right context creates a seamless and pleasant ad viewing experience, resulting in higher audience engagement and, ultimately, better ad monetization. From a technology standpoint, effective contextual advertising requires a video retrieval system capable of understanding complex video content at a very granular level. Current text-to-video retrieval models based on joint multimodal training demand large datasets and computational resources, limiting their practicality and lacking the key functionalities required for ad ecosystem integration. We introduce ContextIQ, a multimodal expert-based video retrieval system designed specifically for contextual advertising. ContextIQ utilizes modality-specific experts-video, audio, transcript (captions), and metadata such as objects, actions, emotion, etc.-to create semantically rich video representations. We show that our system, without joint training, achieves better or comparable results to state-of-the-art models and commercial solutions on multiple text-to-video retrieval benchmarks. Our ablation studies highlight the benefits of leveraging multiple modalities for enhanced video retrieval accuracy instead of using a vision-language model alone. Furthermore, we show how video retrieval systems such as ContextIQ can be used for contextual advertising in an ad ecosystem while also addressing concerns related to brand safety and filtering inappropriate content.</description>

Abstract: A major obstacle to the advancements of machine learning models in marine science, particularly in sonar imagery analysis, is the scarcity of AI-ready datasets. While there have been efforts to make AI-ready sonar image dataset publicly available, they suffer from limitations in terms of environment setting and scale. To bridge this gap, we introduce SeafloorAI, the first extensive AI-ready datasets for seafloor mapping across 5 geological layers that is curated in collaboration with marine scientists. We further extend the dataset to SeafloorGenAI by incorporating the language component in order to facilitate the development of both vision- and language-capable machine learning models for sonar imagery. The dataset consists of 62 geo-distributed data surveys spanning 17,300 square kilometers, with 696K sonar images, 827K annotated segmentation masks, 696K detailed language descriptions and approximately 7M question-answer pairs. By making our data processing source code publicly available, we aim to engage the marine science community to enrich the data pool and inspire the machine learning community to develop more robust models. This collaborative approach will enhance the capabilities and applications of our datasets within both fields.</description>

      <title>Typicalness-Aware Learning for Failure Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) often suffer from the overconfidence issue, where incorrect predictions are made with high confidence scores, hindering the applications in critical systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Typicalness-Aware Learning (TAL) to address this issue and improve failure detection performance. We observe that, with the cross-entropy loss, model predictions are optimized to align with the corresponding labels via increasing logit magnitude or refining logit direction. However, regarding atypical samples, the image content and their labels may exhibit disparities. This discrepancy can lead to overfitting on atypical samples, ultimately resulting in the overconfidence issue that we aim to address. To tackle the problem, we have devised a metric that quantifies the typicalness of each sample, enabling the dynamic adjustment of the logit magnitude during the training process. By allowing atypical samples to be adequately fitted while preserving reliable logit direction, the problem of overconfidence can be mitigated. TAL has been extensively evaluated on benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate its superiority over existing failure detection methods. Specifically, TAL achieves a more than 5% improvement on CIFAR100 in terms of the Area Under the Risk-Coverage Curve (AURC) compared to the state-of-the-art.

      <title>Differentially Private Integrated Decision Gradients (IDG-DP) for Radar-based Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human motion analysis offers significant potential for healthcare monitoring and early detection of diseases. The advent of radar-based sensing systems has captured the spotlight for they are able to operate without physical contact and they can integrate with pre-existing Wi-Fi networks. They are also seen as less privacy-invasive compared to camera-based systems. However, recent research has shown high accuracy in recognizing subjects or gender from radar gait patterns, raising privacy concerns. This study addresses these issues by investigating privacy vulnerabilities in radar-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems and proposing a novel method for privacy preservation using Differential Privacy (DP) driven by attributions derived with Integrated Decision Gradient (IDG) algorithm. We investigate Black-box Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Models in HAR settings across various levels of attacker-accessible information. We extensively evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed IDG-DP method by designing a CNN-based HAR model and rigorously assessing its resilience against MIAs. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of IDG-DP in mitigating privacy attacks while maintaining utility across all settings, particularly excelling against label-only and shadow model black-box MIA attacks. This work represents a crucial step towards balancing the need for effective radar-based HAR with robust privacy protection in healthcare environments.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Caching for Faster Video Generation with Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating temporally-consistent high-fidelity videos can be computationally expensive, especially over longer temporal spans. More-recent Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) -- despite making significant headway in this context -- have only heightened such challenges as they rely on larger models and heavier attention mechanisms, resulting in slower inference speeds. In this paper, we introduce a training-free method to accelerate video DiTs, termed Adaptive Caching (AdaCache), which is motivated by the fact that "not all videos are created equal": meaning, some videos require fewer denoising steps to attain a reasonable quality than others. Building on this, we not only cache computations through the diffusion process, but also devise a caching schedule tailored to each video generation, maximizing the quality-latency trade-off. We further introduce a Motion Regularization (MoReg) scheme to utilize video information within AdaCache, essentially controlling the compute allocation based on motion content. Altogether, our plug-and-play contributions grant significant inference speedups (e.g. up to 4.7x on Open-Sora 720p - 2s video generation) without sacrificing the generation quality, across multiple video DiT baselines.</description>

      <title>INQUIRE: A Natural World Text-to-Image Retrieval Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce INQUIRE, a text-to-image retrieval benchmark designed to challenge multimodal vision-language models on expert-level queries. INQUIRE includes iNaturalist 2024 (iNat24), a new dataset of five million natural world images, along with 250 expert-level retrieval queries. These queries are paired with all relevant images comprehensively labeled within iNat24, comprising 33,000 total matches. Queries span categories such as species identification, context, behavior, and appearance, emphasizing tasks that require nuanced image understanding and domain expertise. Our benchmark evaluates two core retrieval tasks: (1) INQUIRE-Fullrank, a full dataset ranking task, and (2) INQUIRE-Rerank, a reranking task for refining top-100 retrievals. Detailed evaluation of a range of recent multimodal models demonstrates that INQUIRE poses a significant challenge, with the best models failing to achieve an mAP@50 above 50%. In addition, we show that reranking with more powerful multimodal models can enhance retrieval performance, yet there remains a significant margin for improvement. By focusing on scientifically-motivated ecological challenges, INQUIRE aims to bridge the gap between AI capabilities and the needs of real-world scientific inquiry, encouraging the development of retrieval systems that can assist with accelerating ecological and biodiversity research. Our dataset and code are available at https://inquire-benchmark.github.io</description>

      <title>DiT4Edit: Diffusion Transformer for Image Editing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in UNet-based image editing, methods for shape-aware object editing in high-resolution images are still lacking. Compared to UNet, Diffusion Transformers (DiT) demonstrate superior capabilities to effectively capture the long-range dependencies among patches, leading to higher-quality image generation. In this paper, we propose DiT4Edit, the first Diffusion Transformer-based image editing framework. Specifically, DiT4Edit uses the DPM-Solver inversion algorithm to obtain the inverted latents, reducing the number of steps compared to the DDIM inversion algorithm commonly used in UNet-based frameworks. Additionally, we design unified attention control and patches merging, tailored for transformer computation streams. This integration allows our framework to generate higher-quality edited images faster. Our design leverages the advantages of DiT, enabling it to surpass UNet structures in image editing, especially in high-resolution and arbitrary-size images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong performance of DiT4Edit across various editing scenarios, highlighting the potential of Diffusion Transformers in supporting image editing.</description>

      <title>AMNCutter: Affinity-Attention-Guided Multi-View Normalized Cutter for Unsupervised Surgical Instrument Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surgical instrument segmentation (SIS) is pivotal for robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery, assisting surgeons by identifying surgical instruments in endoscopic video frames. Recent unsupervised surgical instrument segmentation (USIS) methods primarily rely on pseudo-labels derived from low-level features such as color and optical flow, but these methods show limited effectiveness and generalizability in complex and unseen endoscopic scenarios. In this work, we propose a label-free unsupervised model featuring a novel module named Multi-View Normalized Cutter (m-NCutter). Different from previous USIS works, our model is trained using a graph-cutting loss function that leverages patch affinities for supervision, eliminating the need for pseudo-labels. The framework adaptively determines which affinities from which levels should be prioritized. Therefore, the low- and high-level features and their affinities are effectively integrated to train a label-free unsupervised model, showing superior effectiveness and generalization ability. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple SIS datasets to validate our approach's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, robustness, and exceptional potential as a pre-trained model. Our code is released at https://github.com/MingyuShengSMY/AMNCutter.</description>

      <title>GS2Pose: Two-stage 6D Object Pose Estimation Guided by Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for accurate and robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects, named GS2Pose. By introducing 3D Gaussian splatting, GS2Pose can utilize the reconstruction results without requiring a high-quality CAD model, which means it only requires segmented RGBD images as input. Specifically, GS2Pose employs a two-stage structure consisting of coarse estimation followed by refined estimation. In the coarse stage, a lightweight U-Net network with a polarization attention mechanism, called Pose-Net, is designed. By using the 3DGS model for supervised training, Pose-Net can generate NOCS images to compute a coarse pose. In the refinement stage, GS2Pose formulates a pose regression algorithm following the idea of reprojection or Bundle Adjustment (BA), referred to as GS-Refiner. By leveraging Lie algebra to extend 3DGS, GS-Refiner obtains a pose-differentiable rendering pipeline that refines the coarse pose by comparing the input images with the rendered images. GS-Refiner also selectively updates parameters in the 3DGS model to achieve environmental adaptation, thereby enhancing the algorithm's robustness and flexibility to illuminative variation, occlusion, and other challenging disruptive factors. GS2Pose was evaluated through experiments conducted on the LineMod dataset, where it was compared with similar algorithms, yielding highly competitive results. The code for GS2Pose will soon be released on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Learning Task-Specific Strategies for Accelerated MRI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compressed sensing magnetic resonance imaging (CS-MRI) seeks to recover visual information from subsampled measurements for diagnostic tasks. Traditional CS-MRI methods often separately address measurement subsampling, image reconstruction, and task prediction, resulting in a suboptimal end-to-end performance. In this work, we propose TACKLE as a unified co-design framework for jointly optimizing subsampling, reconstruction, and prediction strategies for the performance on downstream tasks. The na\"ive approach of simply appending a task prediction module and training with a task-specific loss leads to suboptimal downstream performance. Instead, we develop a training procedure where a backbone architecture is first trained for a generic pre-training task (image reconstruction in our case), and then fine-tuned for different downstream tasks with a prediction head. Experimental results on multiple public MRI datasets show that TACKLE achieves an improved performance on various tasks over traditional CS-MRI methods. We also demonstrate that TACKLE is robust to distribution shifts by showing that it generalizes to a new dataset we experimentally collected using different acquisition setups from the training data. Without additional fine-tuning, TACKLE leads to both numerical and visual improvements compared to existing baselines. We have further implemented a learned 4$\times$-accelerated sequence on a Siemens 3T MRI Skyra scanner. Compared to the fully-sampling scan that takes 335 seconds, our optimized sequence only takes 84 seconds, achieving a four-fold time reduction as desired, while maintaining high performance.</description>

      <title>Evaluating alignment between humans and neural network representations in image-based learning tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans represent scenes and objects in rich feature spaces, carrying information that allows us to generalise about category memberships and abstract functions with few examples. What determines whether a neural network model generalises like a human? We tested how well the representations of $86$ pretrained neural network models mapped to human learning trajectories across two tasks where humans had to learn continuous relationships and categories of natural images. In these tasks, both human participants and neural networks successfully identified the relevant stimulus features within a few trials, demonstrating effective generalisation. We found that while training dataset size was a core determinant of alignment with human choices, contrastive training with multi-modal data (text and imagery) was a common feature of currently publicly available models that predicted human generalisation. Intrinsic dimensionality of representations had different effects on alignment for different model types. Lastly, we tested three sets of human-aligned representations and found no consistent improvements in predictive accuracy compared to the baselines. In conclusion, pretrained neural networks can serve to extract representations for cognitive models, as they appear to capture some fundamental aspects of cognition that are transferable across tasks. Both our paradigms and modelling approach offer a novel way to quantify alignment between neural networks and humans and extend cognitive science into more naturalistic domains.</description>

      <title>Interpreting CLIP: Insights on the Robustness to ImageNet Distribution Shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What distinguishes robust models from non-robust ones? While for ImageNet distribution shifts it has been shown that such differences in robustness can be traced back predominantly to differences in training data, so far it is not known what that translates to in terms of what the model has learned. In this work, we bridge this gap by probing the representation spaces of 16 robust zero-shot CLIP vision encoders with various backbones (ResNets and ViTs) and pretraining sets (OpenAI, LAION-400M, LAION-2B, YFCC15M, CC12M and {DataComp}), and comparing them to the representation spaces of less robust models with identical backbones, but different (pre)training sets or objectives (CLIP pretraining on ImageNet-Captions, and supervised training or finetuning on ImageNet).Through this analysis, we generate three novel insights. Firstly, we detect the presence of outlier features in robust zero-shot CLIP vision encoders, which to the best of our knowledge is the first time these are observed in non-language and non-transformer models. Secondly, we find the existence of outlier features to be an indication of ImageNet shift robustness in models, since we only find them in robust models in our analysis. Lastly, we also investigate the number of unique encoded concepts in the representation space and find zero-shot CLIP models to encode a higher number of unique concepts in their representation space. However, we do not find this to be an indicator of ImageNet shift robustness and hypothesize that it is rather related to the language supervision. Since the presence of outlier features can be detected without access to any data from shifted datasets, we believe that they could be a useful tool for practitioners to get a feeling for the distribution shift robustness of a pretrained model during deployment.</description>

      <title>GD doesn't make the cut: Three ways that non-differentiability affects neural network training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08426v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper critically examines the fundamental distinctions between gradient methods applied to non-differentiable functions (NGDMs) and classical gradient descents (GDs) for differentiable functions, revealing significant gaps in current deep learning optimization theory. We demonstrate that NGDMs exhibit markedly different convergence properties compared to GDs, strongly challenging the applicability of extensive neural network convergence literature based on $L-smoothness$ to non-smooth neural networks. Our analysis reveals paradoxical behavior of NDGM solutions for $L_{1}$-regularized problems, where increasing regularization counterintuitively leads to larger $L_{1}$ norms of optimal solutions. This finding calls into question widely adopted $L_{1}$ penalization techniques for network pruning. We further challenge the common assumption that optimization algorithms like RMSProp behave similarly in differentiable and non-differentiable contexts. Expanding on the Edge of Stability phenomenon, we demonstrate its occurrence in a broader class of functions, including Lipschitz continuous convex differentiable functions. This finding raises important questions about its relevance and interpretation in non-convex, non-differentiable neural networks, particularly those using ReLU activations. Our work identifies critical misunderstandings of NDGMs in influential literature, stemming from an overreliance on strong smoothness assumptions. These findings necessitate a reevaluation of optimization dynamics in deep learning, emphasizing the crucial need for more nuanced theoretical foundations in analyzing these complex systems.</description>

Abstract: Medical imaging refers to the technologies and methods utilized to view the human body and its inside, in order to diagnose, monitor, or even treat medical disorders. This paper aims to explore the application of deep learning techniques in the semantic segmentation of Cardiac short-axis MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) images, aiming to enhance the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of medical disorders related to the heart. The focus centers on implementing various architectures that are derivatives of U-Net, to effectively isolate specific parts of the heart for comprehensive anatomical and functional analysis. Through a combination of images, graphs, and quantitative metrics, the efficacy of the models and their predictions are showcased. Additionally, this paper addresses encountered challenges and outline strategies for future improvements. This abstract provides a concise overview of the efforts in utilizing deep learning for cardiac image segmentation, emphasizing both the accomplishments and areas for further refinement.</description>

      <title>Estimating Epistemic and Aleatoric Uncertainty with a Single Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating and disentangling epistemic uncertainty, uncertainty that is reducible with more training data, and aleatoric uncertainty, uncertainty that is inherent to the task at hand, is critically important when applying machine learning to high-stakes applications such as medical imaging and weather forecasting. Conditional diffusion models' breakthrough ability to accurately and efficiently sample from the posterior distribution of a dataset now makes uncertainty estimation conceptually straightforward: One need only train and sample from a large ensemble of diffusion models. Unfortunately, training such an ensemble becomes computationally intractable as the complexity of the model architecture grows. In this work we introduce a new approach to ensembling, hyper-diffusion models (HyperDM), which allows one to accurately estimate both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty with a single model. Unlike existing single-model uncertainty methods like Monte-Carlo dropout and Bayesian neural networks, HyperDM offers prediction accuracy on par with, and in some cases superior to, multi-model ensembles. Furthermore, our proposed approach scales to modern network architectures such as Attention U-Net and yields more accurate uncertainty estimates compared to existing methods. We validate our method on two distinct real-world tasks: x-ray computed tomography reconstruction and weather temperature forecasting.</description>

      <title>Principled Probabilistic Imaging using Diffusion Models as Plug-and-Play Priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently shown outstanding capabilities in modeling complex image distributions, making them expressive image priors for solving Bayesian inverse problems. However, most existing DM-based methods rely on approximations in the generative process to be generic to different inverse problems, leading to inaccurate sample distributions that deviate from the target posterior defined within the Bayesian framework. To harness the generative power of DMs while avoiding such approximations, we propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that performs posterior sampling for general inverse problems by reducing it to sampling the posterior of a Gaussian denoising problem. Crucially, we leverage a general DM formulation as a unified interface that allows for rigorously solving the denoising problem with a range of state-of-the-art DMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on six inverse problems (three linear and three nonlinear), including a real-world black hole imaging problem. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method offers more accurate reconstructions and posterior estimation compared to existing DM-based imaging inverse methods.</description>

Abstract: The burgeoning field of brain health research increasingly leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to interpret and analyze neurological data. This study introduces a novel approach towards the creation of medical foundation models by integrating a large-scale multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset derived from 41,400 participants in its own. Our method involves a novel two-stage pretraining approach using vision transformers. The first stage is dedicated to encoding anatomical structures in generally healthy brains, identifying key features such as shapes and sizes of different brain regions. The second stage concentrates on spatial information, encompassing aspects like location and the relative positioning of brain structures. We rigorously evaluate our model, BrainFounder, using the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge and Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke v2.0 (ATLAS v2.0) datasets. BrainFounder demonstrates a significant performance gain, surpassing the achievements of the previous winning solutions using fully supervised learning. Our findings underscore the impact of scaling up both the complexity of the model and the volume of unlabeled training data derived from generally healthy brains, which enhances the accuracy and predictive capabilities of the model in complex neuroimaging tasks with MRI. The implications of this research provide transformative insights and practical applications in healthcare and make substantial steps towards the creation of foundation models for Medical AI.

      <title>CardioSpectrum: Comprehensive Myocardium Motion Analysis with 3D Deep Learning and Geometric Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to map left ventricle (LV) myocardial motion using computed tomography angiography (CTA) is essential to diagnosing cardiovascular conditions and guiding interventional procedures. Due to their inherent locality, conventional neural networks typically have difficulty predicting subtle tangential movements, which considerably lessens the level of precision at which myocardium three-dimensional (3D) mapping can be performed. Using 3D optical flow techniques and Functional Maps (FMs), we present a comprehensive approach to address this problem. FMs are known for their capacity to capture global geometric features, thus providing a fuller understanding of 3D geometry. As an alternative to traditional segmentation-based priors, we employ surface-based two-dimensional (2D) constraints derived from spectral correspondence methods. Our 3D deep learning architecture, based on the ARFlow model, is optimized to handle complex 3D motion analysis tasks. By incorporating FMs, we can capture the subtle tangential movements of the myocardium surface precisely, hence significantly improving the accuracy of 3D mapping of the myocardium. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of this method in enhancing myocardium motion analysis. This approach can contribute to improving cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment.

      <title>Variational Zero-shot Multispectral Pansharpening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pansharpening aims to generate a high spatial resolution multispectral image (HRMS) by fusing a low spatial resolution multispectral image (LRMS) and a panchromatic image (PAN). The most challenging issue for this task is that only the to-be-fused LRMS and PAN are available, and the existing deep learning-based methods are unsuitable since they rely on many training pairs. Traditional variational optimization (VO) based methods are well-suited for addressing such a problem. They focus on carefully designing explicit fusion rules as well as regularizations for an optimization problem, which are based on the researcher's discovery of the image relationships and image structures. Unlike previous VO-based methods, in this work, we explore such complex relationships by a parameterized term rather than a manually designed one. Specifically, we propose a zero-shot pansharpening method by introducing a neural network into the optimization objective. This network estimates a representation component of HRMS, which mainly describes the relationship between HRMS and PAN. In this way, the network achieves a similar goal to the so-called deep image prior because it implicitly regulates the relationship between the HRMS and PAN images through its inherent structure. We directly minimize this optimization objective via network parameters and the expected HRMS image through iterative updating. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve better performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Exploring QUIC Dynamics: A Large-Scale Dataset for Encrypted Traffic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: QUIC, a new and increasingly used transport protocol, addresses and resolves the limitations of TCP by offering improved security, performance, and features such as stream multiplexing and connection migration. These features, however, also present challenges for network operators who need to monitor and analyze web traffic. In this paper, we introduce VisQUIC, a labeled dataset comprising over 100,000 QUIC traces from more than 44,000 websites (URLs), collected over a four-month period. These traces provide the foundation for generating more than seven million images, with configurable parameters of window length, pixel resolution, normalization, and labels. These images enable an observer looking at the interactions between a client and a server to analyze and gain insights about QUIC encrypted connections. To illustrate the dataset's potential, we offer a use-case example of an observer estimating the number of HTTP/3 responses/requests pairs in a given QUIC, which can reveal server behavior, client--server interactions, and the load imposed by an observed connection. We formulate the problem as a discrete regression problem, train a machine learning (ML) model for it, and then evaluate it using the proposed dataset on an example use case.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Surgical Instrument Recognition and Segmentation in Robotic-Assisted Surgeries: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applying deep learning (DL) for annotating surgical instruments in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgeries (MIS) represents a significant advancement in surgical technology. This systematic review examines 48 studies that and advanced DL methods and architectures. These sophisticated DL models have shown notable improvements in the precision and efficiency of detecting and segmenting surgical tools. The enhanced capabilities of these models support various clinical applications, including real-time intraoperative guidance, comprehensive postoperative evaluations, and objective assessments of surgical skills. By accurately identifying and segmenting surgical instruments in video data, DL models provide detailed feedback to surgeons, thereby improving surgical outcomes and reducing complication risks. Furthermore, the application of DL in surgical education is transformative. The review underscores the significant impact of DL on improving the accuracy of skill assessments and the overall quality of surgical training programs. However, implementing DL in surgical tool detection and segmentation faces challenges, such as the need for large, accurately annotated datasets to train these models effectively. The manual annotation process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, posing a significant bottleneck. Future research should focus on automating the detection and segmentation process and enhancing the robustness of DL models against environmental variations. Expanding the application of DL models across various surgical specialties will be essential to fully realize this technology's potential. Integrating DL with other emerging technologies, such as augmented reality (AR), also offers promising opportunities to further enhance the precision and efficacy of surgical procedures.</description>

      <title>bit2bit: 1-bit quanta video reconstruction via self-supervised photon prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quanta image sensors, such as SPAD arrays, are an emerging sensor technology, producing 1-bit arrays representing photon detection events over exposures as short as a few nanoseconds. In practice, raw data are post-processed using heavy spatiotemporal binning to create more useful and interpretable images at the cost of degrading spatiotemporal resolution. In this work, we propose bit2bit, a new method for reconstructing high-quality image stacks at the original spatiotemporal resolution from sparse binary quanta image data. Inspired by recent work on Poisson denoising, we developed an algorithm that creates a dense image sequence from sparse binary photon data by predicting the photon arrival location probability distribution. However, due to the binary nature of the data, we show that the assumption of a Poisson distribution is inadequate. Instead, we model the process with a Bernoulli lattice process from the truncated Poisson. This leads to the proposal of a novel self-supervised solution based on a masked loss function. We evaluate our method using both simulated and real data. On simulated data from a conventional video, we achieve 34.35 mean PSNR with extremely photon-sparse binary input (&lt;0.06 photons per pixel per frame). We also present a novel dataset containing a wide range of real SPAD high-speed videos under various challenging imaging conditions. The scenes cover strong/weak ambient light, strong motion, ultra-fast events, etc., which will be made available to the community, on which we demonstrate the promise of our approach. Both reconstruction quality and throughput substantially surpass the state-of-the-art methods (e.g., Quanta Burst Photography (QBP)). Our approach significantly enhances the visualization and usability of the data, enabling the application of existing analysis techniques.</description>

      <title>Beyond Accuracy: Ensuring Correct Predictions With Correct Rationales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large pretrained foundation models demonstrate exceptional performance and, in some high-stakes applications, even surpass human experts. However, most of these models are currently evaluated primarily on prediction accuracy, overlooking the validity of the rationales behind their accurate predictions. For the safe deployment of foundation models, there is a pressing need to ensure double-correct predictions, i.e., correct prediction backed by correct rationales. To achieve this, we propose a two-phase scheme: First, we curate a new dataset that offers structured rationales for visual recognition tasks. Second, we propose a rationale-informed optimization method to guide the model in disentangling and localizing visual evidence for each rationale, without requiring manual annotations. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 10.1% in prediction accuracy across a wide range of tasks. Furthermore, our method significantly improves the model's rationale correctness, improving localization by 7.5% and disentanglement by 36.5%.

      <title>Knowledge Graphs of Driving Scenes to Empower the Emerging Capabilities of Neurosymbolic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of Generative AI, Neurosymbolic AI is emerging as a powerful approach for tasks spanning from perception to cognition. The use of Neurosymbolic AI has been shown to achieve enhanced capabilities, including improved grounding, alignment, explainability, and reliability. However, due to its nascent stage, there is a lack of widely available real-world benchmark datasets tailored to Neurosymbolic AI tasks. To address this gap and support the evaluation of current and future methods, we introduce DSceneKG -- a suite of knowledge graphs of driving scenes built from real-world, high-quality scenes from multiple open autonomous driving datasets. In this article, we detail the construction process of DSceneKG and highlight its application in seven different tasks. DSceneKG is publicly accessible at: https://github.com/ruwantw/DSceneKG</description>

      <title>Undermining Image and Text Classification Algorithms Using Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models are prone to adversarial attacks, where inputs can be manipulated in order to cause misclassifications. While previous research has focused on techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), there's limited exploration of GANs and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) in text and image classification models to perform adversarial attacks. Our study addresses this gap by training various machine learning models and using GANs and SMOTE to generate additional data points aimed at attacking text classification models. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to face recognition models, training a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and subjecting it to adversarial attacks with fast gradient sign perturbations on key features identified by GradCAM, a technique used to highlight key image characteristics CNNs use in classification. Our experiments reveal a significant vulnerability in classification models. Specifically, we observe a 20 % decrease in accuracy for the top-performing text classification models post-attack, along with a 30 % decrease in facial recognition accuracy. This highlights the susceptibility of these models to manipulation of input data. Adversarial attacks not only compromise the security but also undermine the reliability of machine learning systems. By showcasing the impact of adversarial attacks on both text classification and face recognition models, our study underscores the urgent need for develop robust defenses against such vulnerabilities.</description>
