      <title>Bayes-CATSI: A variational Bayesian approach for medical time series data imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical time series datasets feature missing values that need data imputation methods, however, conventional machine learning models fall short due to a lack of uncertainty quantification in predictions. Among these models, the CATSI (Context-Aware Time Series Imputation) stands out for its effectiveness by incorporating a context vector into the imputation process, capturing the global dependencies of each patient. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Context-Aware Time Series Imputation (Bayes-CATSI) framework which leverages uncertainty quantification offered by variational inference. We consider the time series derived from electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiology (EKG). Variational Inference assumes the shape of the posterior distribution and through minimization of the Kullback-Leibler(KL) divergence it finds variational densities that are closest to the true posterior distribution. Thus , we integrate the variational Bayesian deep learning layers into the CATSI model. Our results show that Bayes-CATSI not only provides uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior imputation performance compared to the CATSI model. Specifically, an instance of Bayes-CATSI outperforms CATSI by 9.57 %. We provide an open-source code implementation for applying Bayes-CATSI to other medical data imputation problems.</description>

      <title>An Early-Stage Workflow Proposal for the Generation of Safe and Dependable AI Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation and execution of qualifiable safe and dependable AI models, necessitates definition of a transparent, complete yet adaptable and preferably lightweight workflow. Given the rapidly progressing domain of AI research and the relative immaturity of the safe-AI domain the process stability upon which functionally safety developments rest must be married with some degree of adaptability. This early-stage work proposes such a workflow basing it on a an extended ONNX model description. A use case provides one foundations of this body of work which we expect to be extended by other, third party use-cases.</description>

      <title>Explainable Diagnosis Prediction through Neuro-Symbolic Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagnosis prediction is a critical task in healthcare, where timely and accurate identification of medical conditions can significantly impact patient outcomes. Traditional machine learning and deep learning models have achieved notable success in this domain but often lack interpretability which is a crucial requirement in clinical settings. In this study, we explore the use of neuro-symbolic methods, specifically Logical Neural Networks (LNNs), to develop explainable models for diagnosis prediction. Essentially, we design and implement LNN-based models that integrate domain-specific knowledge through logical rules with learnable thresholds. Our models, particularly $M_{\text{multi-pathway}}$ and $M_{\text{comprehensive}}$, demonstrate superior performance over traditional models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest, achieving higher accuracy (up to 80.52\%) and AUROC scores (up to 0.8457) in the case study of diabetes prediction. The learned weights and thresholds within the LNN models provide direct insights into feature contributions, enhancing interpretability without compromising predictive power. These findings highlight the potential of neuro-symbolic approaches in bridging the gap between accuracy and explainability in healthcare AI applications. By offering transparent and adaptable diagnostic models, our work contributes to the advancement of precision medicine and supports the development of equitable healthcare solutions. Future research will focus on extending these methods to larger and more diverse datasets to further validate their applicability across different medical conditions and populations.</description>

      <title>Learning the Optimal Path and DNN Partition for Collaborative Edge Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have catalyzed the development of numerous intelligent mobile applications and services. However, they also introduce significant computational challenges for resource-constrained mobile devices. To address this, collaborative edge inference has been proposed. This method involves partitioning a DNN inference task into several subtasks and distributing these across multiple network nodes. Despite its potential, most current approaches presume known network parameters -- like node processing speeds and link transmission rates -- or rely on a fixed sequence of nodes for processing the DNN subtasks. In this paper, we tackle a more complex scenario where network parameters are unknown and must be learned, and multiple network paths are available for distributing inference tasks. Specifically, we explore the learning problem of selecting the optimal network path and assigning DNN layers to nodes along this path, considering potential security threats and the costs of switching paths. We begin by deriving structural insights from the DNN layer assignment with complete network information, which narrows down the decision space and provides crucial understanding of optimal assignments. We then cast the learning problem with incomplete network information as a novel adversarial group linear bandits problem with switching costs, featuring rewards generation through a combined stochastic and adversarial process. We introduce a new bandit algorithm, B-EXPUCB, which combines elements of the classical blocked EXP3 and LinUCB algorithms, and demonstrate its sublinear regret. Extensive simulations confirm B-EXPUCB's superior performance in learning for collaborative edge inference over existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>House of Cards: Massive Weights in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive activations, which manifest in specific feature dimensions of hidden states, introduce a significant bias in large language models (LLMs), leading to an overemphasis on the corresponding token. In this paper, we identify that massive activations originate not from the hidden state but from the intermediate state of a feed-forward network module in an early layer. Expanding on the previous observation that massive activations occur only in specific feature dimensions, we dive deep into the weights that cause massive activations. Specifically, we define top-$k$ massive weights as the weights that contribute to the dimensions with the top-$k$ magnitudes in the intermediate state. When these massive weights are set to zero, the functionality of LLMs is entirely disrupted. However, when all weights except for massive weights are set to zero, it results in a relatively minor performance drop, even though a much larger number of weights are set to zero. This implies that during the pre-training process, learning is dominantly focused on massive weights. Building on this observation, we propose a simple plug-and-play method called MacDrop (massive weights curriculum dropout), to rely less on massive weights during parameter-efficient fine-tuning. This method applies dropout to the pre-trained massive weights, starting with a high dropout probability and gradually decreasing it as fine-tuning progresses. Through experiments, we demonstrate that MacDrop generally improves performance across zero-shot downstream tasks and generation tasks.</description>

      <title>NEAT: Nonlinear Parameter-efficient Adaptation of Pre-trained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained models is crucial for adapting large models to downstream tasks, often delivering state-of-the-art performance. However, fine-tuning all model parameters is resource-intensive and laborious, leading to the emergence of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. One widely adopted PEFT technique, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), freezes the pre-trained model weights and introduces two low-rank matrices whose ranks are significantly smaller than the dimensions of the original weight matrices. This enables efficient fine-tuning by adjusting only a small number of parameters. Despite its efficiency, LoRA approximates weight updates using low-rank decomposition, which struggles to capture complex, non-linear components and efficient optimization trajectories. As a result, LoRA-based methods often exhibit a significant performance gap compared to full fine-tuning. Closing this gap requires higher ranks, which increases the number of parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a nonlinear parameter-efficient adaptation method (NEAT). NEAT introduces a lightweight neural network that takes pre-trained weights as input and learns a nonlinear transformation to approximate cumulative weight updates. These updates can be interpreted as functions of the corresponding pre-trained weights. The nonlinear approximation directly models the cumulative updates, effectively capturing complex and non-linear structures in the weight updates. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates taht NEAT can be more efficient than LoRA while having equal or greater expressivity. Extensive evaluations across four benchmarks and over twenty datasets demonstrate that NEAT significantly outperforms baselines in both vision and text tasks.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction Sets Can Cause Disparate Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although conformal prediction is a promising method for quantifying the uncertainty of machine learning models, the prediction sets it outputs are not inherently actionable. Many applications require a single output to act on, not several. To overcome this, prediction sets can be provided to a human who then makes an informed decision. In any such system it is crucial to ensure the fairness of outcomes across protected groups, and researchers have proposed that Equalized Coverage be used as the standard for fairness. By conducting experiments with human participants, we demonstrate that providing prediction sets can increase the unfairness of their decisions. Disquietingly, we find that providing sets that satisfy Equalized Coverage actually increases unfairness compared to marginal coverage. Instead of equalizing coverage, we propose to equalize set sizes across groups which empirically leads to more fair outcomes.</description>

      <title>Is uniform expressivity too restrictive? Towards efficient expressivity of graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uniform expressivity guarantees that a Graph Neural Network (GNN) can express a query without the parameters depending on the size of the input graphs. This property is desirable in applications in order to have number of trainable parameters that is independent of the size of the input graphs. Uniform expressivity of the two variable guarded fragment (GC2) of first order logic is a well-celebrated result for Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) GNNs [Barcelo &amp; al., 2020]. In this article, we prove that uniform expressivity of GC2 queries is not possible for GNNs with a wide class of Pfaffian activation functions (including the sigmoid and tanh), answering a question formulated by [Grohe, 2021]. We also show that despite these limitations, many of those GNNs can still efficiently express GC2 queries in a way that the number of parameters remains logarithmic on the maximal degree of the input graphs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a log-log dependency on the degree is achievable for a certain choice of activation function. This shows that uniform expressivity can be successfully relaxed by covering large graphs appearing in practical applications. Our experiments illustrates that our theoretical estimates hold in practice.</description>

      <title>Provably Accurate Shapley Value Estimation via Leverage Score Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Originally introduced in game theory, Shapley values have emerged as a central tool in explainable machine learning, where they are used to attribute model predictions to specific input features. However, computing Shapley values exactly is expensive: for a general model with $n$ features, $O(2^n)$ model evaluations are necessary. To address this issue, approximation algorithms are widely used. One of the most popular is the Kernel SHAP algorithm, which is model agnostic and remarkably effective in practice. However, to the best of our knowledge, Kernel SHAP has no strong non-asymptotic complexity guarantees. We address this issue by introducing Leverage SHAP, a light-weight modification of Kernel SHAP that provides provably accurate Shapley value estimates with just $O(n\log n)$ model evaluations. Our approach takes advantage of a connection between Shapley value estimation and agnostic active learning by employing leverage score sampling, a powerful regression tool. Beyond theoretical guarantees, we show that Leverage SHAP consistently outperforms even the highly optimized implementation of Kernel SHAP available in the ubiquitous SHAP library [Lundberg &amp; Lee, 2017].</description>

      <title>Step-by-Step Reasoning for Math Problems via Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmenting the multi-step reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a persistent challenge. Recently, verification has shown promise in improving solution consistency by evaluating generated outputs. However, current verification approaches suffer from sampling inefficiencies, requiring a large number of samples to achieve satisfactory performance. Additionally, training an effective verifier often depends on extensive process supervision, which is costly to acquire. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a novel verification method based on Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo (TSMC). TSMC sequentially refines its sampling effort to focus exploration on promising candidates, resulting in more efficient generation of high-quality solutions. We apply TSMC to LLMs by estimating the expected future rewards at partial solutions. This approach results in a more straightforward training target that eliminates the need for step-wise human annotations. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of our method across multiple math benchmarks, and also validate our theoretical analysis of both our approach and existing verification methods.</description>

      <title>NTK-DFL: Enhancing Decentralized Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Settings via Neural Tangent Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) is a collaborative machine learning framework for training a model across participants without a central server or raw data exchange. DFL faces challenges due to statistical heterogeneity, as participants often possess different data distributions reflecting local environments and user behaviors. Recent work has shown that the neural tangent kernel (NTK) approach, when applied to federated learning in a centralized framework, can lead to improved performance. The NTK-based update mechanism is more expressive than typical gradient descent methods, enabling more efficient convergence and better handling of data heterogeneity. We propose an approach leveraging the NTK to train client models in the decentralized setting, while introducing a synergy between NTK-based evolution and model averaging. This synergy exploits inter-model variance and improves both accuracy and convergence in heterogeneous settings. Our model averaging technique significantly enhances performance, boosting accuracy by at least 10% compared to the mean local model accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves higher accuracy than baselines in highly heterogeneous settings, where other approaches often underperform. Additionally, it reaches target performance in 4.6 times fewer communication rounds. We validate our approach across multiple datasets, network topologies, and heterogeneity settings to ensure robustness and generalizability.</description>

      <title>MARPLE: A Benchmark for Long-Horizon Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing past events requires reasoning across long time horizons. To figure out what happened, we need to use our prior knowledge about the world and human behavior and draw inferences from various sources of evidence including visual, language, and auditory cues. We introduce MARPLE, a benchmark for evaluating long-horizon inference capabilities using multi-modal evidence. Our benchmark features agents interacting with simulated households, supporting vision, language, and auditory stimuli, as well as procedurally generated environments and agent behaviors. Inspired by classic ``whodunit'' stories, we ask AI models and human participants to infer which agent caused a change in the environment based on a step-by-step replay of what actually happened. The goal is to correctly identify the culprit as early as possible. Our findings show that human participants outperform both traditional Monte Carlo simulation methods and an LLM baseline (GPT-4) on this task. Compared to humans, traditional inference models are less robust and performant, while GPT-4 has difficulty comprehending environmental changes. We analyze what factors influence inference performance and ablate different modes of evidence, finding that all modes are valuable for performance. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the long-horizon, multimodal inference tasks in our benchmark present a challenge to current models.</description>

      <title>Don't flatten, tokenize! Unlocking the key to SoftMoE's efficacy in deep RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of deep neural networks in reinforcement learning (RL) often suffers from performance degradation as model size increases. While soft mixtures of experts (SoftMoEs) have recently shown promise in mitigating this issue for online RL, the reasons behind their effectiveness remain largely unknown. In this work we provide an in-depth analysis identifying the key factors driving this performance gain. We discover the surprising result that tokenizing the encoder output, rather than the use of multiple experts, is what is behind the efficacy of SoftMoEs. Indeed, we demonstrate that even with an appropriately scaled single expert, we are able to maintain the performance gains, largely thanks to tokenization.</description>

      <title>TAEGAN: Generating Synthetic Tabular Data For Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation has gained significant attention for its potential in data augmentation, software testing and privacy-preserving data sharing. However, most research has primarily focused on larger datasets and evaluating their quality in terms of metrics like column-wise statistical distributions and inter-feature correlations, while often overlooking its utility for data augmentation, particularly for datasets whose data is scarce. In this paper, we propose Tabular Auto-Encoder Generative Adversarial Network (TAEGAN), an improved GAN-based framework for generating high-quality tabular data. Although large language models (LLMs)-based methods represent the state-of-the-art in synthetic tabular data generation, they are often overkill for small datasets due to their extensive size and complexity. TAEGAN employs a masked auto-encoder as the generator, which for the first time introduces the power of self-supervised pre-training in tabular data generation so that essentially exposes the networks to more information. We extensively evaluate TAEGAN against five state-of-the-art synthetic tabular data generation algorithms. Results from 10 datasets show that TAEGAN outperforms existing deep-learning-based tabular data generation models on 9 out of 10 datasets on the machine learning efficacy and achieves superior data augmentation performance on 7 out of 8 smaller datasets.</description>

      <title>CHASE-SQL: Multi-Path Reasoning and Preference Optimized Candidate Selection in Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In tackling the challenges of large language model (LLM) performance for Text-to-SQL tasks, we introduce CHASE-SQL, a new framework that employs innovative strategies, using test-time compute in multi-agent modeling to improve candidate generation and selection. CHASE-SQL leverages LLMs' intrinsic knowledge to generate diverse and high-quality SQL candidates using different LLM generators with: (1) a divide-and-conquer method that decomposes complex queries into manageable sub-queries in a single LLM call; (2) chain-of-thought reasoning based on query execution plans, reflecting the steps a database engine takes during execution; and (3) a unique instance-aware synthetic example generation technique, which offers specific few-shot demonstrations tailored to test questions.To identify the best candidate, a selection agent is employed to rank the candidates through pairwise comparisons with a fine-tuned binary-candidates selection LLM. This selection approach has been demonstrated to be more robust over alternatives. The proposed generators-selector framework not only enhances the quality and diversity of SQL queries but also outperforms previous methods. Overall, our proposed CHASE-SQL achieves the state-of-the-art execution accuracy of 73.0% and 73.01% on the test set and development set of the notable BIRD Text-to-SQL dataset benchmark, rendering CHASE-SQL the top submission of the leaderboard (at the time of paper submission).</description>

      <title>Discrete Copula Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently shown significant progress in modeling complex data, such as natural languages and DNA sequences. However, unlike diffusion models for continuous data, which can generate high-quality samples in just a few denoising steps, modern discrete diffusion models still require hundreds or even thousands of denoising steps to perform well. In this paper, we identify a fundamental limitation that prevents discrete diffusion models from achieving strong performance with fewer steps -- they fail to capture dependencies between output variables at each denoising step. To address this issue, we provide a formal explanation and introduce a general approach to supplement the missing dependency information by incorporating another deep generative model, termed the copula model. Our method does not require fine-tuning either the diffusion model or the copula model, yet it enables high-quality sample generation with significantly fewer denoising steps. When we apply this approach to autoregressive copula models, the combined model outperforms both models individually in unconditional and conditional text generation. Specifically, the hybrid model achieves better (un)conditional text generation using 8 to 32 times fewer denoising steps than the diffusion model alone. In addition to presenting an effective discrete diffusion generation algorithm, this paper emphasizes the importance of modeling inter-variable dependencies in discrete diffusion.</description>

      <title>Score-based pullback Riemannian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven Riemannian geometry has emerged as a powerful tool for interpretable representation learning, offering improved efficiency in downstream tasks. Moving forward, it is crucial to balance cheap manifold mappings with efficient training algorithms. In this work, we integrate concepts from pullback Riemannian geometry and generative models to propose a framework for data-driven Riemannian geometry that is scalable in both geometry and learning: score-based pullback Riemannian geometry. Focusing on unimodal distributions as a first step, we propose a score-based Riemannian structure with closed-form geodesics that pass through the data probability density. With this structure, we construct a Riemannian autoencoder (RAE) with error bounds for discovering the correct data manifold dimension. This framework can naturally be used with anisotropic normalizing flows by adopting isometry regularization during training. Through numerical experiments on various datasets, we demonstrate that our framework not only produces high-quality geodesics through the data support, but also reliably estimates the intrinsic dimension of the data manifold and provides a global chart of the manifold, even in high-dimensional ambient spaces.</description>

      <title>ComaDICE: Offline Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Stationary Distribution Shift Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered significant attention for its ability to learn effective policies from pre-collected datasets without the need for further environmental interactions. While promising results have been demonstrated in single-agent settings, offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) presents additional challenges due to the large joint state-action space and the complexity of multi-agent behaviors. A key issue in offline RL is the distributional shift, which arises when the target policy being optimized deviates from the behavior policy that generated the data. This problem is exacerbated in MARL due to the interdependence between agents' local policies and the expansive joint state-action space. Prior approaches have primarily addressed this challenge by incorporating regularization in the space of either Q-functions or policies. In this work, we introduce a regularizer in the space of stationary distributions to better handle distributional shift. Our algorithm, ComaDICE, offers a principled framework for offline cooperative MARL by incorporating stationary distribution regularization for the global learning policy, complemented by a carefully structured multi-agent value decomposition strategy to facilitate multi-agent training. Through extensive experiments on the multi-agent MuJoCo and StarCraft II benchmarks, we demonstrate that ComaDICE achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art offline MARL methods across nearly all tasks.</description>

      <title>Scale-Invariant Learning-to-Rank</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At Expedia, learning-to-rank (LTR) models plays a key role on our website in sorting and presenting information more relevant to users, such as search filters, property rooms, amenities, and images. A major challenge in deploying these models is ensuring consistent feature scaling between training and production data, as discrepancies can lead to unreliable rankings when deployed. Normalization techniques like feature standardization and batch normalization could address these issues but are impractical in production due to latency impacts and the difficulty of distributed real-time inference. To address consistent feature scaling issue, we introduce a scale-invariant LTR framework which combines a deep and a wide neural network to mathematically guarantee scale-invariance in the model at both training and prediction time. We evaluate our framework in simulated real-world scenarios with injected feature scale issues by perturbing the test set at prediction time, and show that even with inconsistent train-test scaling, using framework achieves better performance than without.</description>

      <title>Which Algorithms Have Tight Generalization Bounds?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study which machine learning algorithms have tight generalization bounds. First, we present conditions that preclude the existence of tight generalization bounds. Specifically, we show that algorithms that have certain inductive biases that cause them to be unstable do not admit tight generalization bounds. Next, we show that algorithms that are sufficiently stable do have tight generalization bounds. We conclude with a simple characterization that relates the existence of tight generalization bounds to the conditional variance of the algorithm's loss.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Alternatives of the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores alternative formulations of the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem (KST) as a foundation for neural network design. The original KST formulation, while mathematically elegant, presents practical challenges due to its limited insight into the structure of inner and outer functions and the large number of unknown variables it introduces. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) leverage KST for function approximation, but they have faced scrutiny due to mixed results compared to traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and practical limitations imposed by the original KST formulation. To address these issues, we introduce ActNet, a scalable deep learning model that builds on the KST and overcomes many of the drawbacks of Kolmogorov's original formulation. We evaluate ActNet in the context of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a framework well-suited for leveraging KST's strengths in low-dimensional function approximation, particularly for simulating partial differential equations (PDEs). In this challenging setting, where models must learn latent functions without direct measurements, ActNet consistently outperforms KANs across multiple benchmarks and is competitive against the current best MLP-based approaches. These results present ActNet as a promising new direction for KST-based deep learning applications, particularly in scientific computing and PDE simulation tasks.</description>

      <title>FairlyUncertain: A Comprehensive Benchmark of Uncertainty in Algorithmic Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fair predictive algorithms hinge on both equality and trust, yet inherent uncertainty in real-world data challenges our ability to make consistent, fair, and calibrated decisions. While fairly managing predictive error has been extensively explored, some recent work has begun to address the challenge of fairly accounting for irreducible prediction uncertainty. However, a clear taxonomy and well-specified objectives for integrating uncertainty into fairness remains undefined. We address this gap by introducing FairlyUncertain, an axiomatic benchmark for evaluating uncertainty estimates in fairness. Our benchmark posits that fair predictive uncertainty estimates should be consistent across learning pipelines and calibrated to observed randomness. Through extensive experiments on ten popular fairness datasets, our evaluation reveals: (1) A theoretically justified and simple method for estimating uncertainty in binary settings is more consistent and calibrated than prior work; (2) Abstaining from binary predictions, even with improved uncertainty estimates, reduces error but does not alleviate outcome imbalances between demographic groups; (3) Incorporating consistent and calibrated uncertainty estimates in regression tasks improves fairness without any explicit fairness interventions. Additionally, our benchmark package is designed to be extensible and open-source, to grow with the field. By providing a standardized framework for assessing the interplay between uncertainty and fairness, FairlyUncertain paves the way for more equitable and trustworthy machine learning practices.</description>

      <title>Addressing Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning with Adaptive Normalization-Free Feature Recalibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized collaborative training paradigm that preserves stakeholders' data ownership while improving performance and generalization. However, statistical heterogeneity among client datasets poses a fundamental challenge by degrading system performance. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Normalization-free Feature Recalibration (ANFR), an architecture-level approach that combines weight standardization and channel attention. Weight standardization normalizes the weights of layers instead of activations. This is less susceptible to mismatched client statistics and inconsistent averaging, thereby more robust under heterogeneity. Channel attention produces learnable scaling factors for feature maps, suppressing those that are inconsistent between clients due to heterogeneity. We demonstrate that combining these techniques boosts model performance beyond their individual contributions, by enhancing class selectivity and optimizing channel attention weight distribution. ANFR operates independently of the aggregation method and is effective in both global and personalized federated learning settings, with minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, when training with differential privacy, ANFR achieves an appealing balance between privacy and utility, enabling strong privacy guarantees without sacrificing performance. By integrating weight standardization and channel attention in the backbone model, ANFR offers a novel and versatile approach to the challenge of statistical heterogeneity. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that ANFR consistently outperforms established baselines across various aggregation methods, datasets, and heterogeneity conditions.</description>

      <title>Adaptively Private Next-Token Prediction of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) proliferate, developing privacy safeguards for these models is crucial. One popular safeguard involves training LLMs in a differentially private manner. However, such solutions are shown to be computationally expensive and detrimental to the utility of these models. Since LLMs are deployed on the cloud and thus only accessible via an API, a Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) provider can protect its downstream data by privatizing the predictions during the decoding process. However, the practicality of such solutions still largely lags behind DP training methods. One recent promising approach, Private Mixing of Ensemble Distributions (PMixED), avoids additive noise by sampling from the output distributions of private LLMs mixed with the output distribution of a public model. Yet, PMixED must satisfy a fixed privacy level for a given number of queries, which is difficult for an analyst to estimate before inference and, hence, does not scale. To this end, we relax the requirements to a more practical setting by introducing Adaptive PMixED (AdaPMixED), a private decoding framework based on PMixED that is adaptive to the private and public output distributions evaluated on a given input query. In this setting, we introduce a noisy screening mechanism that filters out queries with potentially expensive privacy loss, and a data-dependent analysis that exploits the divergence of the private and public output distributions in its privacy loss calculation. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that our mechanism and analysis can reduce the privacy loss by 16x while preserving the utility over the original PMixED. Furthermore, performing 100K predictions with AdaPMixED still achieves strong utility and a reasonable data-dependent privacy loss of 5.25.</description>

      <title>Review Non-convex Optimization Method for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-convex optimization is a critical tool in advancing machine learning, especially for complex models like deep neural networks and support vector machines. Despite challenges such as multiple local minima and saddle points, non-convex techniques offer various pathways to reduce computational costs. These include promoting sparsity through regularization, efficiently escaping saddle points, and employing subsampling and approximation strategies like stochastic gradient descent. Additionally, non-convex methods enable model pruning and compression, which reduce the size of models while maintaining performance. By focusing on good local minima instead of exact global minima, non-convex optimization ensures competitive accuracy with faster convergence and lower computational overhead. This paper examines the key methods and applications of non-convex optimization in machine learning, exploring how it can lower computation costs while enhancing model performance. Furthermore, it outlines future research directions and challenges, including scalability and generalization, that will shape the next phase of non-convex optimization in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Tuning Frequency Bias of State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State space models (SSMs) leverage linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems to effectively learn sequences with long-range dependencies. By analyzing the transfer functions of LTI systems, we find that SSMs exhibit an implicit bias toward capturing low-frequency components more effectively than high-frequency ones. This behavior aligns with the broader notion of frequency bias in deep learning model training. We show that the initialization of an SSM assigns it an innate frequency bias and that training the model in a conventional way does not alter this bias. Based on our theory, we propose two mechanisms to tune frequency bias: either by scaling the initialization to tune the inborn frequency bias; or by applying a Sobolev-norm-based filter to adjust the sensitivity of the gradients to high-frequency inputs, which allows us to change the frequency bias via training. Using an image-denoising task, we empirically show that we can strengthen, weaken, or even reverse the frequency bias using both mechanisms. By tuning the frequency bias, we can also improve SSMs' performance on learning long-range sequences, averaging an 88.26% accuracy on the Long-Range Arena (LRA) benchmark tasks.</description>

      <title>Realizable Continuous-Space Shields for Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across various domains, it remains vulnerable to occasional catastrophic failures without additional safeguards. One effective solution to prevent these failures is to use a shield that validates and adjusts the agent's actions to ensure compliance with a provided set of safety specifications. For real-life robot domains, it is desirable to be able to define such safety specifications over continuous state and action spaces to accurately account for system dynamics and calculate new safe actions that minimally alter the agent's output. In this paper, we propose the first shielding approach to automatically guarantee the realizability of safety requirements for continuous state and action spaces. Realizability is an essential property that confirms the shield will always be able to generate a safe action for any state in the environment. We formally prove that realizability can also be verified with a stateful shield, enabling the incorporation of non-Markovian safety requirements. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in ensuring safety without compromising policy accuracy by applying it to a navigation problem and a multi-agent particle environment.</description>

      <title>EAB-FL: Exacerbating Algorithmic Bias through Model Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a technique that allows multiple parties to train a shared model collaboratively without disclosing their private data. It has become increasingly popular due to its distinct privacy advantages. However, FL models can suffer from biases against certain demographic groups (e.g., racial and gender groups) due to the heterogeneity of data and party selection. Researchers have proposed various strategies for characterizing the group fairness of FL algorithms to address this issue. However, the effectiveness of these strategies in the face of deliberate adversarial attacks has not been fully explored. Although existing studies have revealed various threats (e.g., model poisoning attacks) against FL systems caused by malicious participants, their primary aim is to decrease model accuracy, while the potential of leveraging poisonous model updates to exacerbate model unfairness remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a new type of model poisoning attack, EAB-FL, with a focus on exacerbating group unfairness while maintaining a good level of model utility. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our attack, even with state-of-the-art fairness optimization algorithms and secure aggregation rules employed.</description>

      <title>TPP-LLM: Modeling Temporal Point Processes by Efficiently Fine-Tuning Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are widely used to model the timing and occurrence of events in domains such as social networks, transportation systems, and e-commerce. In this paper, we introduce TPP-LLM, a novel framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with TPPs to capture both the semantic and temporal aspects of event sequences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on categorical event type representations, TPP-LLM directly utilizes the textual descriptions of event types, enabling the model to capture rich semantic information embedded in the text. While LLMs excel at understanding event semantics, they are less adept at capturing temporal patterns. To address this, TPP-LLM incorporates temporal embeddings and employs parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods to effectively learn temporal dynamics without extensive retraining. This approach improves both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Experimental results across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that TPP-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in sequence modeling and event prediction, highlighting the benefits of combining LLMs with TPPs.</description>

      <title>Inspection and Control of Self-Generated-Text Recognition Ability in Llama3-8b-Instruct</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been reported that LLMs can recognize their own writing. As this has potential implications for AI safety, yet is relatively understudied, we investigate the phenomenon, seeking to establish whether it robustly occurs at the behavioral level, how the observed behavior is achieved, and whether it can be controlled. First, we find that the Llama3-8b-Instruct chat model - but not the base Llama3-8b model - can reliably distinguish its own outputs from those of humans, and present evidence that the chat model is likely using its experience with its own outputs, acquired during post-training, to succeed at the writing recognition task. Second, we identify a vector in the residual stream of the model that is differentially activated when the model makes a correct self-written-text recognition judgment, show that the vector activates in response to information relevant to self-authorship, present evidence that the vector is related to the concept of "self" in the model, and demonstrate that the vector is causally related to the model's ability to perceive and assert self-authorship. Finally, we show that the vector can be used to control both the model's behavior and its perception, steering the model to claim or disclaim authorship by applying the vector to the model's output as it generates it, and steering the model to believe or disbelieve it wrote arbitrary texts by applying the vector to them as the model reads them.</description>

      <title>Fast and Sample Efficient Multi-Task Representation Learning in Stochastic Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how representation learning can improve the learning efficiency of contextual bandit problems. We study the setting where we play T contextual linear bandits with dimension d simultaneously, and these T bandit tasks collectively share a common linear representation with a dimensionality of r much smaller than d. We present a new algorithm based on alternating projected gradient descent (GD) and minimization estimator to recover a low-rank feature matrix. Using the proposed estimator, we present a multi-task learning algorithm for linear contextual bandits and prove the regret bound of our algorithm. We presented experiments and compared the performance of our algorithm against benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>MMFNet: Multi-Scale Frequency Masking Neural Network for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) is critical for numerous real-world applications, such as electricity consumption planning, financial forecasting, and disease propagation analysis. LTSF requires capturing long-range dependencies between inputs and outputs, which poses significant challenges due to complex temporal dynamics and high computational demands. While linear models reduce model complexity by employing frequency domain decomposition, current approaches often assume stationarity and filter out high-frequency components that may contain crucial short-term fluctuations. In this paper, we introduce MMFNet, a novel model designed to enhance long-term multivariate forecasting by leveraging a multi-scale masked frequency decomposition approach. MMFNet captures fine, intermediate, and coarse-grained temporal patterns by converting time series into frequency segments at varying scales while employing a learnable mask to filter out irrelevant components adaptively. Extensive experimentation with benchmark datasets shows that MMFNet not only addresses the limitations of the existing methods but also consistently achieves good performance. Specifically, MMFNet achieves up to 6.0% reductions in the Mean Squared Error (MSE) compared to state-of-the-art models designed for multivariate forecasting tasks.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models have revolutionized various domains, with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) being a cornerstone for tasks like data regression and image classification. However, a recent study has introduced Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as promising alternatives to MLPs, leveraging activation functions placed on edges rather than nodes. This structural shift aligns KANs closely with the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, potentially enhancing both model accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we explore the efficacy of KANs in the context of data representation via autoencoders, comparing their performance with traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our results demonstrate that KAN-based autoencoders achieve competitive performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy, thereby suggesting their viability as effective tools in data analysis tasks.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Modeling for Identification of Noisy, Non-Stationary Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant challenge in many fields of science and engineering is making sense of time-dependent measurement data by recovering governing equations in the form of differential equations. We focus on finding parsimonious ordinary differential equation (ODE) models for nonlinear, noisy, and non-autonomous dynamical systems and propose a machine learning method for data-driven system identification. While many methods tackle noisy and limited data, non-stationarity - where differential equation parameters change over time - has received less attention. Our method, dynamic SINDy, combines variational inference with SINDy (sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics) to model time-varying coefficients of sparse ODEs. This framework allows for uncertainty quantification of ODE coefficients, expanding on previous methods for autonomous systems. These coefficients are then interpreted as latent variables and added to the system to obtain an autonomous dynamical model. We validate our approach using synthetic data, including nonlinear oscillators and the Lorenz system, and apply it to neuronal activity data from C. elegans. Dynamic SINDy uncovers a global nonlinear model, showing it can handle real, noisy, and chaotic datasets. We aim to apply our method to a variety of problems, specifically dynamic systems with complex time-dependent parameters.</description>

      <title>MixLinear: Extreme Low Resource Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with 0.1K Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF), which involves predicting long-term future values by analyzing a large amount of historical time-series data to identify patterns and trends. There exist significant challenges in LTSF due to its complex temporal dependencies and high computational demands. Although Transformer-based models offer high forecasting accuracy, they are often too compute-intensive to be deployed on devices with hardware constraints. On the other hand, the linear models aim to reduce the computational overhead by employing either decomposition methods in the time domain or compact representations in the frequency domain. In this paper, we propose MixLinear, an ultra-lightweight multivariate time series forecasting model specifically designed for resource-constrained devices. MixLinear effectively captures both temporal and frequency domain features by modeling intra-segment and inter-segment variations in the time domain and extracting frequency variations from a low-dimensional latent space in the frequency domain. By reducing the parameter scale of a downsampled $n$-length input/output one-layer linear model from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$, MixLinear achieves efficient computation without sacrificing accuracy. Extensive evaluations with four benchmark datasets show that MixLinear attains forecasting performance comparable to, or surpassing, state-of-the-art models with significantly fewer parameters ($0.1K$), which makes it well-suited for deployment on devices with limited computational capacity.</description>

      <title>FARM: Functional Group-Aware Representations for Small Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Functional Group-Aware Representations for Small Molecules (FARM), a novel foundation model designed to bridge the gap between SMILES, natural language, and molecular graphs. The key innovation of FARM lies in its functional group-aware tokenization, which incorporates functional group information directly into the representations. This strategic reduction in tokenization granularity in a way that is intentionally interfaced with key drivers of functional properties (i.e., functional groups) enhances the model's understanding of chemical language, expands the chemical lexicon, more effectively bridging SMILES and natural language, and ultimately advances the model's capacity to predict molecular properties. FARM also represents molecules from two perspectives: by using masked language modeling to capture atom-level features and by employing graph neural networks to encode the whole molecule topology. By leveraging contrastive learning, FARM aligns these two views of representations into a unified molecular embedding. We rigorously evaluate FARM on the MoleculeNet dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 out of 12 tasks. These results highlight FARM's potential to improve molecular representation learning, with promising applications in drug discovery and pharmaceutical research.</description>

      <title>Multi-Omic and Quantum Machine Learning Integration for Lung Subtypes Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is a red-hot field that brings novel discoveries and exciting opportunities to resolve, speed up, or refine the analysis of a wide range of computational problems. In the realm of biomedical research and personalized medicine, the significance of multi-omics integration lies in its ability to provide a thorough and holistic comprehension of complex biological systems. This technology links fundamental research to clinical practice. The insights gained from integrated omics data can be translated into clinical tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. The fusion of quantum computing and machine learning holds promise for unraveling complex patterns within multi-omics datasets, providing unprecedented insights into the molecular landscape of lung cancer. Due to the heterogeneity, complexity, and high dimensionality of multi-omic cancer data, characterized by the vast number of features (such as gene expression, micro-RNA, and DNA methylation) relative to the limited number of lung cancer patient samples, our prime motivation for this paper is the integration of multi-omic data, unique feature selection, and diagnostic classification of lung subtypes: lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC-I) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD-II) using quantum machine learning. We developed a method for finding the best differentiating features between LUAD and LUSC datasets, which has the potential for biomarker discovery.</description>

      <title>Anchors Aweigh! Sail for Optimal Unified Multi-Modal Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a crucial role in enabling machine learning models to fuse and utilize diverse data sources, such as text, images, and audio, to support a variety of downstream tasks. A unified representation across various modalities is particularly important for improving efficiency and performance. Recent binding methods, such as ImageBind (Girdhar et al., 2023), typically use a fixed anchor modality to align multimodal data in the anchor modal embedding space. In this paper, we mathematically analyze the fixed anchor binding methods and uncover notable limitations: (1) over-reliance on the choice of the anchor modality, (2) failure to capture intra-modal information, and (3) failure to account for inter-modal correlation among non-anchored modalities. To address these limitations, we propose CentroBind, a simple yet powerful approach that eliminates the need for a fixed anchor; instead, it employs dynamically adjustable centroid-based anchors generated from all available modalities, resulting in a balanced and rich representation space. We theoretically demonstrate that our method captures three crucial properties of multimodal learning: intra-modal learning, inter-modal learning, and multimodal alignment, while also constructing a robust unified representation across all modalities. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, showing that dynamic anchor methods outperform all fixed anchor binding methods as the former captures more nuanced multimodal interactions.</description>

      <title>HyperBrain: Anomaly Detection for Temporal Hypergraph Brain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying unusual brain activity is a crucial task in neuroscience research, as it aids in the early detection of brain disorders. It is common to represent brain networks as graphs, and researchers have developed various graph-based machine learning methods for analyzing them. However, the majority of existing graph learning tools for the brain face a combination of the following three key limitations. First, they focus only on pairwise correlations between regions of the brain, limiting their ability to capture synchronized activity among larger groups of regions. Second, they model the brain network as a static network, overlooking the temporal changes in the brain. Third, most are designed only for classifying brain networks as healthy or disordered, lacking the ability to identify abnormal brain activity patterns linked to biomarkers associated with disorders. To address these issues, we present HyperBrain, an unsupervised anomaly detection framework for temporal hypergraph brain networks. HyperBrain models fMRI time series data as temporal hypergraphs capturing dynamic higher-order interactions. It then uses a novel customized temporal walk (BrainWalk) and neural encodings to detect abnormal co-activations among brain regions. We evaluate the performance of HyperBrain in both synthetic and real-world settings for Autism Spectrum Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder(ADHD). HyperBrain outperforms all other baselines on detecting abnormal co-activations in brain networks. Furthermore, results obtained from HyperBrain are consistent with clinical research on these brain disorders. Our findings suggest that learning temporal and higher-order connections in the brain provides a promising approach to uncover intricate connectivity patterns in brain networks, offering improved diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Mamba Neural Operator: Who Wins? Transformers vs. State-Space Models for PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are widely used to model complex physical systems, but solving them efficiently remains a significant challenge. Recently, Transformers have emerged as the preferred architecture for PDEs due to their ability to capture intricate dependencies. However, they struggle with representing continuous dynamics and long-range interactions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Mamba Neural Operator (MNO), a novel framework that enhances neural operator-based techniques for solving PDEs. MNO establishes a formal theoretical connection between structured state-space models (SSMs) and neural operators, offering a unified structure that can adapt to diverse architectures, including Transformer-based models. By leveraging the structured design of SSMs, MNO captures long-range dependencies and continuous dynamics more effectively than traditional Transformers. Through extensive analysis, we show that MNO significantly boosts the expressive power and accuracy of neural operators, making it not just a complement but a superior framework for PDE-related tasks, bridging the gap between efficient representation and accurate solution approximation.</description>

      <title>Dataset Distillation via Knowledge Distillation: Towards Efficient Self-Supervised Pre-Training of Deep Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) generates small synthetic datasets that can efficiently train deep networks with a limited amount of memory and compute. Despite the success of DD methods for supervised learning, DD for self-supervised pre-training of deep models has remained unaddressed. Pre-training on unlabeled data is crucial for efficiently generalizing to downstream tasks with limited labeled data. In this work, we propose the first effective DD method for SSL pre-training. First, we show, theoretically and empirically, that naive application of supervised DD methods to SSL fails, due to the high variance of the SSL gradient. Then, we address this issue by relying on insights from knowledge distillation (KD) literature. Specifically, we train a small student model to match the representations of a larger teacher model trained with SSL. Then, we generate a small synthetic dataset by matching the training trajectories of the student models. As the KD objective has considerably lower variance than SSL, our approach can generate synthetic datasets that can successfully pre-train high-quality encoders. Through extensive experiments, we show that our distilled sets lead to up to 13% higher accuracy than prior work, on a variety of downstream tasks, in the presence of limited labeled data.</description>

Abstract: Dense linear layers are the dominant computational bottleneck in large neural networks, presenting a critical need for more efficient alternatives. Previous efforts focused on a small number of hand-crafted structured matrices and neglected to investigate whether these structures can surpass dense layers in terms of compute-optimal scaling laws when both the model size and training examples are optimally allocated. In this work, we present a unifying framework that enables searching among all linear operators expressible via an Einstein summation. This framework encompasses many previously proposed structures, such as low-rank, Kronecker, Tensor-Train, Block Tensor-Train (BTT), and Monarch, along with many novel structures. To analyze the framework, we develop a taxonomy of all such operators based on their computational and algebraic properties and show that differences in the compute-optimal scaling laws are mostly governed by a small number of variables that we introduce. Namely, a small $\omega$ (which measures parameter sharing) and large $\psi$ (which measures the rank) reliably led to better scaling laws. Guided by the insight that full-rank structures that maximize parameters per unit of compute perform the best, we propose BTT-MoE, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture obtained by sparsifying computation in the BTT structure. In contrast to the standard sparse MoE for each entire feed-forward network, BTT-MoE learns an MoE in every single linear layer of the model, including the projection matrices in the attention blocks. We find BTT-MoE provides a substantial compute-efficiency gain over dense layers and standard MoE.</description>

      <title>Breaking the mold: The challenge of large scale MARL specialization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multi-agent learning, the predominant approach focuses on generalization, often neglecting the optimization of individual agents. This emphasis on generalization limits the ability of agents to utilize their unique strengths, resulting in inefficiencies. This paper introduces Comparative Advantage Maximization (CAM), a method designed to enhance individual agent specialization in multiagent systems. CAM employs a two-phase process, combining centralized population training with individual specialization through comparative advantage maximization. CAM achieved a 13.2% improvement in individual agent performance and a 14.9% increase in behavioral diversity compared to state-of-the-art systems. The success of CAM highlights the importance of individual agent specialization, suggesting new directions for multi-agent system development.</description>

      <title>C-MELT: Contrastive Enhanced Masked Auto-Encoders for ECG-Language Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate interpretation of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is pivotal for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. Integrating ECG signals with their accompanying textual reports holds immense potential to enhance clinical diagnostics through the combination of physiological data and qualitative insights. However, this integration faces significant challenges due to inherent modality disparities and the scarcity of labeled data for robust cross-modal learning. To address these obstacles, we propose C-MELT, a novel framework that pre-trains ECG and text data using a contrastive masked auto-encoder architecture. C-MELT uniquely combines the strengths of generative with enhanced discriminative capabilities to achieve robust cross-modal representations. This is accomplished through masked modality modeling, specialized loss functions, and an improved negative sampling strategy tailored for cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments on five public datasets across diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that C-MELT significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 15% and 2% increases in linear probing and zero-shot performance over state-of-the-art models, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of C-MELT, underscoring its potential to advance automated clinical diagnostics through multi-modal representations.</description>

      <title>Nonuniform random feature models using derivative information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose nonuniform data-driven parameter distributions for neural network initialization based on derivative data of the function to be approximated. These parameter distributions are developed in the context of non-parametric regression models based on shallow neural networks, and compare favorably to well-established uniform random feature models based on conventional weight initialization. We address the cases of Heaviside and ReLU activation functions, and their smooth approximations (sigmoid and softplus), and use recent results on the harmonic analysis and sparse representation of neural networks resulting from fully trained optimal networks. Extending analytic results that give exact representation, we obtain densities that concentrate in regions of the parameter space corresponding to neurons that are well suited to model the local derivatives of the unknown function. Based on these results, we suggest simplifications of these exact densities based on approximate derivative data in the input points that allow for very efficient sampling and lead to performance of random feature models close to optimal networks in several scenarios.</description>

      <title>TrajGPT: Irregular Time-Series Representation Learning for Health Trajectory Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many domains, such as healthcare, time-series data is often irregularly sampled with varying intervals between observations. This poses challenges for classical time-series models that require equally spaced data. To address this, we propose a novel time-series Transformer called Trajectory Generative Pre-trained Transformer (TrajGPT). TrajGPT employs a novel Selective Recurrent Attention (SRA) mechanism, which utilizes a data-dependent decay to adaptively filter out irrelevant past information based on contexts. By interpreting TrajGPT as discretized ordinary differential equations (ODEs), it effectively captures the underlying continuous dynamics and enables time-specific inference for forecasting arbitrary target timesteps. Experimental results demonstrate that TrajGPT excels in trajectory forecasting, drug usage prediction, and phenotype classification without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. By evolving the learned continuous dynamics, TrajGPT can interpolate and extrapolate disease risk trajectories from partially-observed time series. The visualization of predicted health trajectories shows that TrajGPT forecasts unseen diseases based on the history of clinically relevant phenotypes (i.e., contexts).</description>

      <title>Disentangled Representation Learning for Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) have demonstrated remarkable success in learning mappings between function spaces, serving as efficient approximators for the forward solutions of complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). However, while effective as black-box solvers, they offer limited insight into the underlying physical mechanism, due to the lack of interpretable representations of the physical parameters that drive the system. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new paradigm for learning disentangled representations from neural operator parameters, thereby effectively solving an inverse problem. Specifically, we introduce DisentangO, a novel hyper-neural operator architecture designed to unveil and disentangle the latent physical factors of variation embedded within the black-box neural operator parameters. At the core of DisentangO is a multi-task neural operator architecture that distills the varying parameters of the governing PDE through a task-wise adaptive layer, coupled with a hierarchical variational autoencoder that disentangles these variations into identifiable latent factors. By learning these disentangled representations, our model not only enhances physical interpretability but also enables more robust generalization across diverse physical systems. Empirical evaluations across supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning contexts show that DisentangO effectively extracts meaningful and interpretable latent features, bridging the divide between predictive performance and physical understanding in neural operator frameworks.</description>

      <title>A Formal Framework for Understanding Length Generalization in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge for transformers is generalizing to sequences longer than those observed during training. While previous works have empirically shown that transformers can either succeed or fail at length generalization depending on the task, theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. In this work, we introduce a rigorous theoretical framework to analyze length generalization in causal transformers with learnable absolute positional encodings. In particular, we characterize those functions that are identifiable in the limit from sufficiently long inputs with absolute positional encodings under an idealized inference scheme using a norm-based regularizer. This enables us to prove the possibility of length generalization for a rich family of problems. We experimentally validate the theory as a predictor of success and failure of length generalization across a range of algorithmic and formal language tasks. Our theory not only explains a broad set of empirical observations but also opens the way to provably predicting length generalization capabilities in transformers.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-Play Controllable Generation for Discrete Masked Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article makes discrete masked models for the generative modeling of discrete data controllable. The goal is to generate samples of a discrete random variable that adheres to a posterior distribution, satisfies specific constraints, or optimizes a reward function. This methodological development enables broad applications across downstream tasks such as class-specific image generation and protein design. Existing approaches for controllable generation of masked models typically rely on task-specific fine-tuning or additional modifications, which can be inefficient and resource-intensive. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel plug-and-play framework based on importance sampling that bypasses the need for training a conditional score. Our framework is agnostic to the choice of control criteria, requires no gradient information, and is well-suited for tasks such as posterior sampling, Bayesian inverse problems, and constrained generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments, showcasing its versatility across multiple domains, including protein design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active learning methods aim to improve sample complexity in machine learning. In this work, we investigate an active learning scheme via a novel gradient-free cutting-plane training method for ReLU networks of arbitrary depth. We demonstrate, for the first time, that cutting-plane algorithms, traditionally used in linear models, can be extended to deep neural networks despite their nonconvexity and nonlinear decision boundaries. Our results demonstrate that these methods provide a promising alternative to the commonly employed gradient-based optimization techniques in large-scale neural networks. Moreover, this training method induces the first deep active learning scheme known to achieve convergence guarantees. We exemplify the effectiveness of our proposed active learning method against popular deep active learning baselines via both synthetic data experiments and sentimental classification task on real datasets.</description>

      <title>Efficient Source-Free Time-Series Adaptation via Parameter Subspace Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework for efficient Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) in the context of time-series, focusing on enhancing both parameter efficiency and data-sample utilization. Our approach introduces an improved paradigm for source-model preparation and target-side adaptation, aiming to enhance training efficiency during target adaptation. Specifically, we reparameterize the source model's weights in a Tucker-style decomposed manner, factorizing the model into a compact form during the source model preparation phase. During target-side adaptation, only a subset of these decomposed factors is fine-tuned, leading to significant improvements in training efficiency. We demonstrate using PAC Bayesian analysis that this selective fine-tuning strategy implicitly regularizes the adaptation process by constraining the model's learning capacity. Furthermore, this re-parameterization reduces the overall model size and enhances inference efficiency, making the approach particularly well suited for resource-constrained devices. Additionally, we demonstrate that our framework is compatible with various SFDA methods and achieves significant computational efficiency, reducing the number of fine-tuned parameters and inference overhead in terms of MACs by over 90% while maintaining model performance.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Approximation for Neural Operators in Nonlinear Parabolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators serve as universal approximators for general continuous operators. In this paper, we derive the approximation rate of solution operators for the nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), contributing to the quantitative approximation theorem for solution operators of nonlinear PDEs. Our results show that neural operators can efficiently approximate these solution operators without the exponential growth in model complexity, thus strengthening the theoretical foundation of neural operators. A key insight in our proof is to transfer PDEs into the corresponding integral equations via Duahamel's principle, and to leverage the similarity between neural operators and Picard's iteration, a classical algorithm for solving PDEs. This approach is potentially generalizable beyond parabolic PDEs to a range of other equations, including the Navier-Stokes equation, nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations and nonlinear wave equations, which can be solved by Picard's iteration.</description>

      <title>ClassContrast: Bridging the Spatial and Contextual Gaps for Node Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the domain of graph representation learning by utilizing neighborhood aggregation schemes in many popular architectures, such as message passing graph neural networks (MPGNNs). This scheme involves iteratively calculating a node's representation vector by aggregating and transforming the representation vectors of its adjacent nodes. Despite their effectiveness, MPGNNs face significant issues, such as oversquashing, oversmoothing, and underreaching, which hamper their effectiveness. Additionally, the reliance of MPGNNs on the homophily assumption, where edges typically connect nodes with similar labels and features, limits their performance in heterophilic contexts, where connected nodes often have significant differences. This necessitates the development of models that can operate effectively in both homophilic and heterophilic settings.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, ClassContrast, grounded in Energy Landscape Theory from Chemical Physics, to overcome these limitations. ClassContrast combines spatial and contextual information, leveraging a physics-inspired energy landscape to model node embeddings that are both discriminative and robust across homophilic and heterophilic settings. Our approach introduces contrast-based homophily matrices to enhance the understanding of class interactions and tendencies. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ClassContrast outperforms traditional GNNs in node classification and link prediction tasks, proving its effectiveness and versatility in diverse real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Memorization In Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) can "memorize" information, i.e., encode training data in their weights in such a way that inference-time queries can lead to verbatim regurgitation of that data. This ability to extract training data can be problematic, for example, when data are private or sensitive. In this work, we investigate methods to mitigate memorization: three regularizer-based, three finetuning-based, and eleven machine unlearning-based methods, with five of the latter being new methods that we introduce. We also introduce TinyMem, a suite of small, computationally-efficient LMs for the rapid development and evaluation of memorization-mitigation methods. We demonstrate that the mitigation methods that we develop using TinyMem can successfully be applied to production-grade LMs, and we determine via experiment that: regularizer-based mitigation methods are slow and ineffective at curbing memorization; fine-tuning-based methods are effective at curbing memorization, but overly expensive, especially for retaining higher accuracies; and unlearning-based methods are faster and more effective, allowing for the precise localization and removal of memorized information from LM weights prior to inference. We show, in particular, that our proposed unlearning method BalancedSubnet outperforms other mitigation methods at removing memorized information while preserving performance on target tasks.</description>

      <title>Universality in Transfer Learning for Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer learning is an attractive framework for problems where there is a paucity of data, or where data collection is costly. One common approach to transfer learning is referred to as "model-based", and involves using a model that is pretrained on samples from a source distribution, which is easier to acquire, and then fine-tuning the model on a few samples from the target distribution. The hope is that, if the source and target distributions are ``close", then the fine-tuned model will perform well on the target distribution even though it has seen only a few samples from it. In this work, we study the problem of transfer learning in linear models for both regression and binary classification. In particular, we consider the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on a linear model initialized with pretrained weights and using a small training data set from the target distribution. In the asymptotic regime of large models, we provide an exact and rigorous analysis and relate the generalization errors (in regression) and classification errors (in binary classification) for the pretrained and fine-tuned models. In particular, we give conditions under which the fine-tuned model outperforms the pretrained one. An important aspect of our work is that all the results are "universal", in the sense that they depend only on the first and second order statistics of the target distribution. They thus extend well beyond the standard Gaussian assumptions commonly made in the literature.</description>

      <title>Training Nonlinear Transformers for Chain-of-Thought Inference: A Theoretical Generalization Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is an efficient prompting method that enables the reasoning ability of large language models by augmenting the query using multiple examples with multiple intermediate steps. Despite the empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how to train a Transformer to achieve the CoT ability remains less explored. This is primarily due to the technical challenges involved in analyzing the nonconvex optimization on nonlinear attention models. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first theoretical study of training Transformers with nonlinear attention to obtain the CoT generalization capability so that the resulting model can inference on unseen tasks when the input is augmented by examples of the new task. We first quantify the required training samples and iterations to train a Transformer model towards CoT ability. We then prove the success of its CoT generalization on unseen tasks with distribution-shifted testing data. Moreover, we theoretically characterize the conditions for an accurate reasoning output by CoT even when the provided reasoning examples contain noises and are not always accurate. In contrast, in-context learning (ICL), which can be viewed as one-step CoT without intermediate steps, may fail to provide an accurate output when CoT does. These theoretical findings are justified through experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting faithful trajectories of multivariate time series from practical scopes is essential for reasonable decision-making. Recent methods majorly tailor generative conditional diffusion models to estimate the target temporal predictive distribution. However, it remains an obstacle to enhance the exploitation efficiency of given implicit temporal predictive information to bolster conditional diffusion learning. To this end, we propose a generic channel-aware Contrastive Conditional Diffusion model entitled CCDM to achieve desirable Multivariate probabilistic forecasting, obviating the need for curated temporal conditioning inductive biases. In detail, we first design a channel-centric conditional denoising network to manage intra-variate variations and cross-variate correlations, which can lead to scalability on diverse prediction horizons and channel numbers. Then, we devise an ad-hoc denoising-based temporal contrastive learning to explicitly amplify the predictive mutual information between past observations and future forecasts. It can coherently complement naive step-wise denoising diffusion training and improve the forecasting accuracy and generality on unknown test time series. Besides, we offer theoretic insights on the benefits of such auxiliary contrastive training refinement from both neural mutual information and temporal distribution generalization aspects. The proposed CCDM can exhibit superior forecasting capability compared to current state-of-the-art diffusion forecasters over a comprehensive benchmark, with best MSE and CRPS outcomes on $66.67\%$ and $83.33\%$ cases.

      <title>Abstract Reward Processes: Leveraging State Abstraction for Consistent Off-Policy Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating policies using off-policy data is crucial for applying reinforcement learning to real-world problems such as healthcare and autonomous driving. Previous methods for off-policy evaluation (OPE) generally suffer from high variance or irreducible bias, leading to unacceptably high prediction errors. In this work, we introduce STAR, a framework for OPE that encompasses a broad range of estimators -- which include existing OPE methods as special cases -- that achieve lower mean squared prediction errors. STAR leverages state abstraction to distill complex, potentially continuous problems into compact, discrete models which we call abstract reward processes (ARPs). Predictions from ARPs estimated from off-policy data are provably consistent (asymptotically correct). Rather than proposing a specific estimator, we present a new framework for OPE and empirically demonstrate that estimators within STAR outperform existing methods. The best STAR estimator outperforms baselines in all twelve cases studied, and even the median STAR estimator surpasses the baselines in seven out of the twelve cases.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Deploying LLMs with Controlled Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying large language models in production requires simultaneous attention to efficiency and risk control. Prior work has shown the possibility to cut costs while maintaining similar accuracy, but has neglected to focus on risk control. By contrast, here we present hierarchical chains with multi-level abstention (HCMA), which use model-intrinsic uncertainty to delegate queries along the LLM intelligence hierarchy, enabling training-free model switching based solely on black-box API calls. Our framework presents novel trade-offs between efficiency and risk. For example, deploying HCMA on MMLU cuts the error rate of Llama3 405B by 30% when the model is allowed to abstain on 20% of the queries. To calibrate HCMA for optimal performance, our approach uses data-efficient logistic regressions (based on a simple nonlinear feature transformation), which require only 50 or 100 labeled examples to achieve excellent calibration error (ECE), cutting ECE by 50% compared to naive Platt scaling. On free-form generation tasks, we find that chain-of-thought is ineffectual for selective prediction, whereas zero-shot prompting drives error to 0% on TruthfulQA at high abstention rates. As LLMs are increasingly deployed across computing environments with different capabilities (such as mobile, laptop, and cloud), our framework paves the way towards maintaining deployment efficiency while putting in place sharp risk controls.</description>

      <title>Towards Better Generalization: Weight Decay Induces Low-rank Bias for Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the implicit bias towards low-rank weight matrices when training neural networks (NN) with Weight Decay (WD). We prove that when a ReLU NN is sufficiently trained with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and WD, its weight matrix is approximately a rank-two matrix. Empirically, we demonstrate that WD is a necessary condition for inducing this low-rank bias across both regression and classification tasks. Our work differs from previous studies as our theoretical analysis does not rely on common assumptions regarding the training data distribution, optimality of weight matrices, or specific training procedures. Furthermore, by leveraging the low-rank bias, we derive improved generalization error bounds and provide numerical evidence showing that better generalization can be achieved. Thus, our work offers both theoretical and empirical insights into the strong generalization performance of SGD when combined with WD.</description>

      <title>CodeJudge: Evaluating Code Generation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in code generation. However, how to reliably evaluate code generated by LLMs remains an unresolved problem. This paper presents CodeJudge, a code evaluation framework that leverages LLMs to evaluate the semantic correctness of generated code without the need for test cases. We investigate different ways to guide the LLM in performing "slow thinking" to arrive at an in-depth and reliable evaluation. We experimented with four LLMs as evaluators on four code generation datasets and five programming languages. The results show that CodeJudge significantly outperformed existing methods in most settings. Furthermore, compared with a SOTA GPT-3.5-based code evaluation method, CodeJudge achieved better results even when using a much smaller model, Llama-3-8B-Instruct. Our code and datasets are available on GitHub https://github.com/VichyTong/CodeJudge.</description>

      <title>BACKTIME: Backdoor Attacks on Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting is a fundamental task with numerous real-world applications, such as transportation, climate, and epidemiology. While a myriad of powerful deep learning models have been developed for this task, few works have explored the robustness of MTS forecasting models to malicious attacks, which is crucial for their trustworthy employment in high-stake scenarios. To address this gap, we dive deep into the backdoor attacks on MTS forecasting models and propose an effective attack method named BackTime.By subtly injecting a few stealthy triggers into the MTS data, BackTime can alter the predictions of the forecasting model according to the attacker's intent. Specifically, BackTime first identifies vulnerable timestamps in the data for poisoning, and then adaptively synthesizes stealthy and effective triggers by solving a bi-level optimization problem with a GNN-based trigger generator. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and state-of-the-art MTS forecasting models demonstrate the effectiveness, versatility, and stealthiness of \method{} attacks. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/xiaolin-cs/BackTime}.</description>

      <title>G2T-LLM: Graph-to-Tree Text Encoding for Molecule Generation with Fine-Tuned Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce G2T-LLM, a novel approach for molecule generation that uses graph-to-tree text encoding to transform graph-based molecular structures into a hierarchical text format optimized for large language models (LLMs). This encoding converts complex molecular graphs into tree-structured formats, such as JSON and XML, which LLMs are particularly adept at processing due to their extensive pre-training on these types of data. By leveraging the flexibility of LLMs, our approach allows for intuitive interaction using natural language prompts, providing a more accessible interface for molecular design. Through supervised fine-tuning, G2T-LLM generates valid and coherent chemical structures, addressing common challenges like invalid outputs seen in traditional graph-based methods. While LLMs are computationally intensive, they offer superior generalization and adaptability, enabling the generation of diverse molecular structures with minimal task-specific customization. The proposed approach achieved comparable performances with state-of-the-art methods on various benchmark molecular generation datasets, demonstrating its potential as a flexible and innovative tool for AI-driven molecular design.</description>

      <title>Deep Koopman-layered Model with Universal Property Based on Toeplitz Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose deep Koopman-layered models with learnable parameters in the form of Toeplitz matrices for analyzing the dynamics of time-series data. The proposed model has both theoretical solidness and flexibility. By virtue of the universal property of Toeplitz matrices and the reproducing property underlined in the model, we can show its universality and the generalization property. In addition, the flexibility of the proposed model enables the model to fit time-series data coming from nonautonomous dynamical systems. When training the model, we apply Krylov subspace methods for efficient computations. In addition, the proposed model can be regarded as a neural ODE-based model. In this sense, the proposed model establishes a new connection among Koopman operators, neural ODEs, and numerical linear algebraic methods.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Prefix-tuning: Statistical Benefits of Reparameterization among Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt-based techniques, such as prompt-tuning and prefix-tuning, have gained prominence for their efficiency in fine-tuning large pre-trained models. Despite their widespread adoption, the theoretical foundations of these methods remain limited. For instance, in prefix-tuning, we observe that a key factor in achieving performance parity with full fine-tuning lies in the reparameterization strategy. However, the theoretical principles underpinning the effectiveness of this approach have yet to be thoroughly examined. Our study demonstrates that reparameterization is not merely an engineering trick but is grounded in deep theoretical foundations. Specifically, we show that the reparameterization strategy implicitly encodes a shared structure between prefix key and value vectors. Building on recent insights into the connection between prefix-tuning and mixture of experts models, we further illustrate that this shared structure significantly improves sample efficiency in parameter estimation compared to non-shared alternatives. The effectiveness of prefix-tuning across diverse tasks is empirically confirmed to be enhanced by the shared structure, through extensive experiments in both visual and language domains. Additionally, we uncover similar structural benefits in prompt-tuning, offering new perspectives on its success. Our findings provide theoretical and empirical contributions, advancing the understanding of prompt-based methods and their underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Sampling from Deterministic Flow Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic flow models, such as rectified flows, offer a general framework for learning a deterministic transport map between two distributions, realized as the vector field for an ordinary differential equation (ODE). However, they are sensitive to model estimation and discretization errors and do not permit different samples conditioned on an intermediate state, limiting their application. We present a general method to turn the underlying ODE of such flow models into a family of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that have the same marginal distributions. This method permits us to derive families of \emph{stochastic samplers}, for fixed (e.g., previously trained) \emph{deterministic} flow models, that continuously span the spectrum of deterministic and stochastic sampling, given access to the flow field and the score function. Our method provides additional degrees of freedom that help alleviate the issues with the deterministic samplers and empirically outperforms them. We empirically demonstrate advantages of our method on a toy Gaussian setup and on the large scale ImageNet generation task. Further, our family of stochastic samplers provide an additional knob for controlling the diversity of generation, which we qualitatively demonstrate in our experiments.</description>

      <title>Doubly Optimal Policy Evaluation for Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy evaluation estimates the performance of a policy by (1) collecting data from the environment and (2) processing raw data into a meaningful estimate. Due to the sequential nature of reinforcement learning, any improper data-collecting policy or data-processing method substantially deteriorates the variance of evaluation results over long time steps. Thus, policy evaluation often suffers from large variance and requires massive data to achieve the desired accuracy. In this work, we design an optimal combination of data-collecting policy and data-processing baseline. Theoretically, we prove our doubly optimal policy evaluation method is unbiased and guaranteed to have lower variance than previously best-performing methods. Empirically, compared with previous works, we show our method reduces variance substantially and achieves superior empirical performance.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Downstream Model Risks via Model Provenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research and industry are rapidly advancing the innovation and adoption of foundation model-based systems, yet the tools for managing these models have not kept pace. Understanding the provenance and lineage of models is critical for researchers, industry, regulators, and public trust. While model cards and system cards were designed to provide transparency, they fall short in key areas: tracing model genealogy, enabling machine readability, offering reliable centralized management systems, and fostering consistent creation incentives. This challenge mirrors issues in software supply chain security, but AI/ML remains at an earlier stage of maturity. Addressing these gaps requires industry-standard tooling that can be adopted by foundation model publishers, open-source model innovators, and major distribution platforms. We propose a machine-readable model specification format to simplify the creation of model records, thereby reducing error-prone human effort, notably when a new model inherits most of its design from a foundation model. Our solution explicitly traces relationships between upstream and downstream models, enhancing transparency and traceability across the model lifecycle. To facilitate the adoption, we introduce the unified model record (UMR) repository , a semantically versioned system that automates the publication of model records to multiple formats (PDF, HTML, LaTeX) and provides a hosted web interface (https://modelrecord.com/). This proof of concept aims to set a new standard for managing foundation models, bridging the gap between innovation and responsible model management.</description>

      <title>C-MORL: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning through Efficient Discovery of Pareto Front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) excels at handling rapidly changing preferences in tasks that involve multiple criteria, even for unseen preferences. However, previous dominating MORL methods typically generate a fixed policy set or preference-conditioned policy through multiple training iterations exclusively for sampled preference vectors, and cannot ensure the efficient discovery of the Pareto front. Furthermore, integrating preferences into the input of policy or value functions presents scalability challenges, in particular as the dimension of the state and preference space grow, which can complicate the learning process and hinder the algorithm's performance on more complex tasks. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage Pareto front discovery algorithm called Constrained MORL (C-MORL), which serves as a seamless bridge between constrained policy optimization and MORL. Concretely, a set of policies is trained in parallel in the initialization stage, with each optimized towards its individual preference over the multiple objectives. Then, to fill the remaining vacancies in the Pareto front, the constrained optimization steps are employed to maximize one objective while constraining the other objectives to exceed a predefined threshold. Empirically, compared to recent advancements in MORL methods, our algorithm achieves more consistent and superior performances in terms of hypervolume, expected utility, and sparsity on both discrete and continuous control tasks, especially with numerous objectives (up to nine objectives in our experiments).</description>

      <title>Robust Weight Initialization for Tanh Neural Networks with Fixed Point Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a neural network's depth increases, it can achieve strong generalization performance. Training, however, becomes challenging due to gradient issues. Theoretical research and various methods have been introduced to address this issues. However, research on weight initialization methods that can be effectively applied to tanh neural networks of varying sizes still needs to be completed. This paper presents a novel weight initialization method for Feedforward Neural Networks with tanh activation function. Based on an analysis of the fixed points of the function $\tanh(ax)$, our proposed method aims to determine values of $a$ that prevent the saturation of activations. A series of experiments on various classification datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust to network size variations than the existing method. Furthermore, when applied to Physics-Informed Neural Networks, the method exhibits faster convergence and robustness to variations of the network size compared to Xavier initialization in problems of Partial Differential Equations.</description>

      <title>PFGuard: A Generative Framework with Privacy and Fairness Safeguards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models must ensure both privacy and fairness for Trustworthy AI. While these goals have been pursued separately, recent studies propose to combine existing privacy and fairness techniques to achieve both goals. However, naively combining these techniques can be insufficient due to privacy-fairness conflicts, where a sample in a minority group may be amplified for fairness, only to be suppressed for privacy. We demonstrate how these conflicts lead to adverse effects, such as privacy violations and unexpected fairness-utility tradeoffs. To mitigate these risks, we propose PFGuard, a generative framework with privacy and fairness safeguards, which simultaneously addresses privacy, fairness, and utility. By using an ensemble of multiple teacher models, PFGuard balances privacy-fairness conflicts between fair and private training stages and achieves high utility based on ensemble learning. Extensive experiments show that PFGuard successfully generates synthetic data on high-dimensional data while providing both fairness convergence and strict DP guarantees - the first of its kind to our knowledge.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), built on Transformer architectures, exhibit remarkable generalization across a wide range of tasks. However, fine-tuning these models for specific tasks remains resource-intensive due to their extensive parameterization. In this paper, we investigate two remarkable phenomena observed during the fine-tuning of LLMs, particularly focusing on the attention mechanism: (1) Different Impact, optimizing the $\mathbf{W}_v$ matrix significantly improves performance over optimizing the $\mathbf{W}_k$ matrix. Fine-tuning only the $\mathbf{W}_q$ and $\mathbf{W}_v$ matrices is computationally efficient, delivering results that are comparable to, or even better than, fine-tuning all three matrices $\mathbf{W}_q$, $\mathbf{W}_k$, and $\mathbf{W}_v$. (2) Efficient Convergence, employing distinct learning rates for these matrices is crucial for optimal performance, with a higher learning rate for the $\mathbf{W}_v$ matrix expediting convergence. However, theoretical analyses of these phenomena are still relatively limited. We present a theoretical analysis of these phenomena from two perspectives: (i) Generalization, where we demonstrate that fine-tuning only $\mathbf{W}_q$ and $\mathbf{W}_v$ improves generalization bounds, enhances memory efficiency, and (ii) Optimization, where we emphasize that the feature learning of the attention mechanism is efficient, particularly when using distinct learning rates for the matrices, which leads to more effective fine-tuning. Building on these insights, we propose a new strategy that improves fine-tuning efficiency in terms of both storage and time. Experimental results on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of this approach, supporting our theoretical findings. Our analysis lays the theoretical groundwork for configuring and improving lightweight algorithms in LLMs fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>FedScalar: A Communication efficient Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has gained considerable popularity for distributed machine learning due to its ability to preserve the privacy of participating agents by eliminating the need for data aggregation. Nevertheless, communication costs between agents and the central server in FL are substantial in large-scale problems and remain a limiting factor for this algorithm. This paper introduces an innovative algorithm, called \emph{FedScalar}, within the federated learning framework aimed at improving communication efficiency. Unlike traditional FL methods that require agents to send high-dimensional vectors to the server, \emph{FedScalar} enables agents to communicate updates using a single scalar. Each agent encodes its updated model parameters into a scalar through the inner product between its local update difference and a random vector, which is then transmitted to the server. The server decodes this information by projecting the averaged scalar values onto the random vector. Our method thereby significantly reduces communication overhead. Technically, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{K})$ to a stationary point for smooth, non-convex loss functions. Additionally, our analysis shows that altering the underlying distribution of the random vector generated by the server can reduce the variance during the aggregation step of the algorithm. Finally, we validate the performance and communication efficiency of our algorithm with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Meta-Learning via Dynamic Head and Heterogeneous Task Construction for Few-Shot Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meta-learning has been widely used in recent years in areas such as few-shot learning and reinforcement learning. However, the questions of why and when it is better than other algorithms in few-shot classification remain to be explored. In this paper, we perform pre-experiments by adjusting the proportion of label noise and the degree of task heterogeneity in the dataset. We use the metric of Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis to quantify the representation stability of the neural network and thus to compare the behavior of meta-learning and classical learning algorithms. We find that benefiting from the bi-level optimization strategy, the meta-learning algorithm has better robustness to label noise and heterogeneous tasks. Based on the above conclusion, we argue a promising future for meta-learning in the unsupervised area, and thus propose DHM-UHT, a dynamic head meta-learning algorithm with unsupervised heterogeneous task construction. The core idea of DHM-UHT is to use DBSCAN and dynamic head to achieve heterogeneous task construction and meta-learn the whole process of unsupervised heterogeneous task construction. On several unsupervised zero-shot and few-shot datasets, DHM-UHT obtains state-of-the-art performance. The code is released at https://github.com/tuantuange/DHM-UHT.</description>

      <title>Structural-Entropy-Based Sample Selection for Efficient and Effective Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sample selection improves the efficiency and effectiveness of machine learning models by providing informative and representative samples. Typically, samples can be modeled as a sample graph, where nodes are samples and edges represent their similarities. Most existing methods are based on local information, such as the training difficulty of samples, thereby overlooking global information, such as connectivity patterns. This oversight can result in suboptimal selection because global information is crucial for ensuring that the selected samples well represent the structural properties of the graph. To address this issue, we employ structural entropy to quantify global information and losslessly decompose it from the whole graph to individual nodes using the Shapley value. Based on the decomposition, we present $\textbf{S}$tructural-$\textbf{E}$ntropy-based sample $\textbf{S}$election ($\textbf{SES}$), a method that integrates both global and local information to select informative and representative samples. SES begins by constructing a $k$NN-graph among samples based on their similarities. It then measures sample importance by combining structural entropy (global metric) with training difficulty (local metric). Finally, SES applies importance-biased blue noise sampling to select a set of diverse and representative samples. Comprehensive experiments on three learning scenarios -- supervised learning, active learning, and continual learning -- clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Best-of-Both-Worlds Policy Optimization for CMDPs with Bandit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study online learning in constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) in which rewards and constraints may be either stochastic or adversarial. In such settings, Stradi et al.(2024) proposed the first best-of-both-worlds algorithm able to seamlessly handle stochastic and adversarial constraints, achieving optimal regret and constraint violation bounds in both cases. This algorithm suffers from two major drawbacks. First, it only works under full feedback, which severely limits its applicability in practice. Moreover, it relies on optimizing over the space of occupancy measures, which requires solving convex optimization problems, an highly inefficient task. In this paper, we provide the first best-of-both-worlds algorithm for CMDPs with bandit feedback. Specifically, when the constraints are stochastic, the algorithm achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret and constraint violation, while, when they are adversarial, it attains $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ constraint violation and a tight fraction of the optimal reward. Moreover, our algorithm is based on a policy optimization approach, which is much more efficient than occupancy-measure-based methods.</description>

      <title>Perfect Counterfactuals in Imperfect Worlds: Modelling Noisy Implementation of Actions in Sequential Algorithmic Recourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic recourse provides actions to individuals who have been adversely affected by automated decision-making and helps them achieve a desired outcome. Knowing the recourse, however, does not guarantee that users would implement it perfectly, either due to environmental variability or personal choices. Recourse generation should thus anticipate its sub-optimal or noisy implementation. While several approaches have constructed recourse that accounts for robustness to small perturbation (i.e., noisy recourse implementation), they assume an entire recourse to be implemented in a single step and thus apply one-off uniform noise to it. Such assumption is unrealistic since recourse often includes multiple sequential steps which becomes harder to implement and subject to more noise. In this work, we consider recourse under plausible noise that adapts to the local data geometry and accumulates at every step of the way. We frame this problem as a Markov Decision Process and demonstrate that the distribution of our plausible noise satisfies the Markov property. We then propose the RObust SEquential (ROSE) recourse generator to output a sequence of steps that will lead to the desired outcome even under imperfect implementation. Given our plausible modelling of sub-optimal human actions and greater recourse robustness to accumulated uncertainty, ROSE can grant users higher chances of success under low recourse costs. Empirical evaluation shows our algorithm manages the inherent trade-off between recourse robustness and costs more effectively while ensuring its low sparsity and fast computation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Strong Regret and Violation in Constrained MDPs via Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study online learning in \emph{constrained MDPs} (CMDPs), focusing on the goal of attaining sublinear strong regret and strong cumulative constraint violation. Differently from their standard (weak) counterparts, these metrics do not allow negative terms to compensate positive ones, raising considerable additional challenges. Efroni et al. (2020) were the first to propose an algorithm with sublinear strong regret and strong violation, by exploiting linear programming. Thus, their algorithm is highly inefficient, leaving as an open problem achieving sublinear bounds by means of policy optimization methods, which are much more efficient in practice. Very recently, Muller et al. (2024) have partially addressed this problem by proposing a policy optimization method that allows to attain $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{0.93})$ strong regret/violation. This still leaves open the question of whether optimal bounds are achievable by using an approach of this kind. We answer such a question affirmatively, by providing an efficient policy optimization algorithm with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ strong regret/violation. Our algorithm implements a primal-dual scheme that employs a state-of-the-art policy optimization approach for adversarial (unconstrained) MDPs as primal algorithm, and a UCB-like update for dual variables.</description>

      <title>Density based Spatial Clustering of Lines via Probabilistic Generation of Neighbourhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density based spatial clustering of points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ has a myriad of applications in a variety of industries. We generalise this problem to the density based clustering of lines in high-dimensional spaces, keeping in mind there exists no valid distance measure that follows the triangle inequality for lines. In this paper, we design a clustering algorithm that generates a customised neighbourhood for a line of a fixed volume (given as a parameter), based on an optional parameter as a continuous probability density function. This algorithm is not sensitive to the outliers and can effectively identify the noise in the data using a cardinality parameter. One of the pivotal applications of this algorithm is clustering data points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with missing entries, while utilising the domain knowledge of the respective data. In particular, the proposed algorithm is able to cluster $n$-dimensional data points that contain at least $(n-1)$-dimensional information. We illustrate the neighbourhoods for the standard probability distributions with continuous probability density functions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on various synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g., rail and road networks). The experimental results also highlight its application in clustering incomplete data.</description>

      <title>Efficient Second-Order Neural Network Optimization via Adaptive Trust Region Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-order optimization methods offer notable advantages in training deep neural networks by utilizing curvature information to achieve faster convergence. However, traditional second-order techniques are computationally prohibitive, primarily due to the large matrix inversions and high memory demands they require. While adaptive trust-region methods have been developed to mitigate these issues, their performance is often hindered by conservative estimates of key parameters, such as the Lipschitz constant of the Hessian, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. In this paper, we introduce SecondOrderAdaptiveAdam (SOAA), a novel optimization algorithm designed to overcome these limitations. SOAA approximates the Fisher information matrix using a diagonal representation, reducing computational complexity from \(O(n^{2})\) to \(O(n)\), thereby making it suitable for large-scale deep learning models, including large language models (LLMs). Additionally, the algorithm integrates an adaptive trust-region mechanism that dynamically adjusts the trust region size based on observed loss reduction, ensuring both robust convergence and computational efficiency. We empirically demonstrate that SOAA achieves faster and more stable convergence compared to first-order optimizers, such as Adam, under similar computational constraints. However, the diagonal approximation of the Fisher information matrix may be less effective in capturing higher-order interactions between gradients, suggesting potential areas for further refinement and future research.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Score-Based Discrete Diffusion Models: A Discrete-Time Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved great success in generating high-dimensional samples across various applications. While the theoretical guarantees for continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively studied, the convergence analysis of the discrete-state counterparts remains under-explored. In this paper, we study the theoretical aspects of score-based discrete diffusion models under the Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) framework. We introduce a discrete-time sampling algorithm in the general state space $[S]^d$ that utilizes score estimators at predefined time points. We derive convergence bounds for the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and total variation (TV) distance between the generated sample distribution and the data distribution, considering both scenarios with and without early stopping under specific assumptions. Notably, our KL divergence bounds are nearly linear in dimension $d$, aligning with state-of-the-art results for diffusion models. Our convergence analysis employs a Girsanov-based method and establishes key properties of the discrete score function, which are essential for characterizing the discrete-time sampling process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lexical tones play a crucial role in Sino-Tibetan languages. However, current phonetic fieldwork relies on manual effort, resulting in substantial time and financial costs. This is especially challenging for the numerous endangered languages that are rapidly disappearing, often compounded by limited funding. In this paper, we introduce pitch-based similarity representations for tone transcription, named Tone2Vec. Experiments on dialect clustering and variance show that Tone2Vec effectively captures fine-grained tone variation. Utilizing Tone2Vec, we develop the first automatic approach for tone transcription and clustering by presenting a novel representation transformation for transcriptions. Additionally, these algorithms are systematically integrated into an open-sourced and easy-to-use package, ToneLab, which facilitates automated fieldwork and cross-regional, cross-lexical analysis for tonal languages. Extensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</description>

      <title>Data Optimisation of Machine Learning Models for Smart Irrigation in Urban Parks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban environments face significant challenges due to climate change, including extreme heat, drought, and water scarcity, which impact public health, community well-being, and local economies. Effective management of these issues is crucial, particularly in areas like Sydney Olympic Park, which relies on one of Australia's largest irrigation systems. The Smart Irrigation Management for Parks and Cool Towns (SIMPaCT) project, initiated in 2021, leverages advanced technologies and machine learning models to optimize irrigation and induce physical cooling. This paper introduces two novel methods to enhance the efficiency of the SIMPaCT system's extensive sensor network and applied machine learning models. The first method employs clustering of sensor time series data using K-shape and K-means algorithms to estimate readings from missing sensors, ensuring continuous and reliable data. This approach can detect anomalies, correct data sources, and identify and remove redundant sensors to reduce maintenance costs. The second method involves sequential data collection from different sensor locations using robotic systems, significantly reducing the need for high numbers of stationary sensors. Together, these methods aim to maintain accurate soil moisture predictions while optimizing sensor deployment and reducing maintenance costs, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the smart irrigation system. Our evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of soil moisture monitoring networks. The cluster-based replacement of missing sensors provides up to 5.4% decrease in average error. The sequential sensor data collection as a robotic emulation shows 17.2% and 2.1% decrease in average error for circular and linear paths respectively.</description>

      <title>RelChaNet: Neural Network Feature Selection using Relative Change Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an ongoing effort to develop feature selection algorithms to improve interpretability, reduce computational resources, and minimize overfitting in predictive models. Neural networks stand out as architectures on which to build feature selection methods, and recently, neuron pruning and regrowth have emerged from the sparse neural network literature as promising new tools. We introduce RelChaNet, a novel and lightweight feature selection algorithm that uses neuron pruning and regrowth in the input layer of a dense neural network. For neuron pruning, a gradient sum metric measures the relative change induced in a network after a feature enters, while neurons are randomly regrown. We also propose an extension that adapts the size of the input layer at runtime. Extensive experiments on nine different datasets show that our approach generally outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, and in particular improves the average accuracy by 2% on the MNIST dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/flxzimmer/relchanet.</description>

      <title>Simplicity bias and optimization threshold in two-layer ReLU networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding generalization of overparametrized neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Most of the literature mostly studies generalization from an interpolation point of view, taking convergence of parameters towards a global minimum of the training loss for granted. While overparametrized architectures indeed interpolated the data for typical classification tasks, this interpolation paradigm does not seem valid anymore for more complex tasks such as in-context learning or diffusion. Instead for such tasks, it has been empirically observed that the trained models goes from global minima to spurious local minima of the training loss as the number of training samples becomes larger than some level we call optimization threshold. While the former yields a poor generalization to the true population loss, the latter was observed to actually correspond to the minimiser of this true loss. This paper explores theoretically this phenomenon in the context of two-layer ReLU networks. We demonstrate that, despite overparametrization, networks often converge toward simpler solutions rather than interpolating the training data, which can lead to a drastic improvement on the test loss with respect to interpolating solutions. Our analysis relies on the so called early alignment phase, during which neurons align towards specific directions. This directional alignment, which occurs in the early stage of training, leads to a simplicity bias, wherein the network approximates the ground truth model without converging to the global minimum of the training loss. Our results suggest that this bias, resulting in an optimization threshold from which interpolation is not reached anymore, is beneficial and enhances the generalization of trained models.</description>

      <title>SageAttention: Accurate 8-Bit Attention for Plug-and-play Inference Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transformer architecture predominates across various models. As the heart of the transformer, attention has a computational complexity of O(N^2), compared to O(N) for linear transformations. When handling large sequence lengths, attention becomes the primary time-consuming component. Although quantization has proven to be an effective method for accelerating model inference, existing quantization methods primarily focus on optimizing the linear layer. In response, we first analyze the feasibility of quantization in attention detailedly. Following that, we propose SageAttention, a highly efficient and accurate quantization method for attention. The OPS (operations per second) of our approach outperforms FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 2.1 times and 2.7 times, respectively. SageAttention also achieves superior accuracy performance over FlashAttention3. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs almost no end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for large language processing, image generation, and video generation.</description>

      <title>Unveiling AI's Blind Spots: An Oracle for In-Domain, Out-of-Domain, and Adversarial Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI models make mistakes when recognizing images-whether in-domain, out-of-domain, or adversarial. Predicting these errors is critical for improving system reliability, reducing costly mistakes, and enabling proactive corrections in real-world applications such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. However, understanding what mistakes AI models make, why they occur, and how to predict them remains an open challenge. Here, we conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations using a "mentor" model-a deep neural network designed to predict another model's errors. Our findings show that the mentor model excels at learning from a mentee's mistakes on adversarial images with small perturbations and generalizes effectively to predict in-domain and out-of-domain errors of the mentee. Additionally, transformer-based mentor models excel at predicting errors across various mentee architectures. Subsequently, we draw insights from these observations and develop an "oracle" mentor model, dubbed SuperMentor, that achieves 78% accuracy in predicting errors across different error types. Our error prediction framework paves the way for future research on anticipating and correcting AI model behaviours, ultimately increasing trust in AI systems. All code, models, and data will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>BiSSL: Bilevel Optimization for Self-Supervised Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present BiSSL, a first-of-its-kind training framework that introduces bilevel optimization to enhance the alignment between the pretext pre-training and downstream fine-tuning stages in self-supervised learning. BiSSL formulates the pretext and downstream task objectives as the lower- and upper-level objectives in a bilevel optimization problem and serves as an intermediate training stage within the self-supervised learning pipeline. By more explicitly modeling the interdependence of these training stages, BiSSL facilitates enhanced information sharing between them, ultimately leading to a backbone parameter initialization that is better suited for the downstream task. We propose a training algorithm that alternates between optimizing the two objectives defined in BiSSL. Using a ResNet-18 backbone pre-trained with SimCLR on the STL10 dataset, we demonstrate that our proposed framework consistently achieves improved or competitive classification accuracies across various downstream image classification datasets compared to the conventional self-supervised learning pipeline. Qualitative analyses of the backbone features further suggest that BiSSL enhances the alignment of downstream features in the backbone prior to fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>MANTRA: The Manifold Triangulations Assemblage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising interest in leveraging higher-order interactions present in complex systems has led to a surge in more expressive models exploiting high-order structures in the data, especially in topological deep learning (TDL), which designs neural networks on high-order domains such as simplicial complexes. However, progress in this field is hindered by the scarcity of datasets for benchmarking these architectures. To address this gap, we introduce MANTRA, the first large-scale, diverse, and intrinsically high order dataset for benchmarking high-order models, comprising over 43,000 and 249,000 triangulations of surfaces and three-dimensional manifolds, respectively. With MANTRA, we assess several graph- and simplicial complex-based models on three topological classification tasks. We demonstrate that while simplicial complex-based neural networks generally outperform their graph-based counterparts in capturing simple topological invariants, they also struggle, suggesting a rethink of TDL. Thus, MANTRA serves as a benchmark for assessing and advancing topological methods, leading the way for more effective high-order models.</description>

      <title>Online Multi-Label Classification under Noisy and Changing Label Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-label data stream usually contains noisy labels in the real-world applications, namely occuring in both relevant and irrelevant labels. However, existing online multi-label classification methods are mostly limited in terms of label quality and fail to deal with the case of noisy labels. On the other hand, the ground-truth label distribution may vary with the time changing, which is hidden in the observed noisy label distribution and difficult to track, posing a major challenge for concept drift adaptation. Motivated by this, we propose an online multi-label classification algorithm under Noisy and Changing Label Distribution (NCLD). The convex objective is designed to simultaneously model the label scoring and the label ranking for high accuracy, whose robustness to NCLD benefits from three novel works: 1) The local feature graph is used to reconstruct the label scores jointly with the observed labels, and an unbiased ranking loss is derived and applied to learn reliable ranking information. 2) By detecting the difference between two adjacent chunks with the unbiased label cardinality, we identify the change in the ground-truth label distribution and reset the ranking or all information learned from the past to match the new distribution. 3) Efficient and accurate updating is achieved based on the updating rule derived from the closed-form optimal model solution. Finally, empirical experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method in classifying instances under NCLD.</description>

      <title>An Online Feasible Point Method for Benign Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a repeatedly played generalized Nash equilibrium game. This induces a multi-agent online learning problem with joint constraints. An important challenge in this setting is that the feasible set for each agent depends on the simultaneous moves of the other agents and, therefore, varies over time. As a consequence, the agents face time-varying constraints, which are not adversarial but rather endogenous to the system. Prior work in this setting focused on convergence to a feasible solution in the limit via integrating the constraints in the objective as a penalty function. However, no existing work can guarantee that the constraints are satisfied for all iterations while simultaneously guaranteeing convergence to a generalized Nash equilibrium. This is a problem of fundamental theoretical interest and practical relevance. In this work, we introduce a new online feasible point method. Under the assumption that limited communication between the agents is allowed, this method guarantees feasibility. We identify the class of benign generalized Nash equilibrium problems, for which the convergence of our method to the equilibrium is guaranteed. We set this class of benign generalized Nash equilibrium games in context with existing definitions and illustrate our method with examples.</description>

      <title>Eliminating Oversaturation and Artifacts of High Guidance Scales in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is crucial for improving both generation quality and alignment between the input condition and final output in diffusion models. While a high guidance scale is generally required to enhance these aspects, it also causes oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. In this paper, we revisit the CFG update rule and introduce modifications to address this issue. We first decompose the update term in CFG into parallel and orthogonal components with respect to the conditional model prediction and observe that the parallel component primarily causes oversaturation, while the orthogonal component enhances image quality. Accordingly, we propose down-weighting the parallel component to achieve high-quality generations without oversaturation. Additionally, we draw a connection between CFG and gradient ascent and introduce a new rescaling and momentum method for the CFG update rule based on this insight. Our approach, termed adaptive projected guidance (APG), retains the quality-boosting advantages of CFG while enabling the use of higher guidance scales without oversaturation. APG is easy to implement and introduces practically no additional computational overhead to the sampling process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that APG is compatible with various conditional diffusion models and samplers, leading to improved FID, recall, and saturation scores while maintaining precision comparable to CFG, making our method a superior plug-and-play alternative to standard classifier-free guidance.</description>

      <title>Learning K-U-Net with constant complexity: An Application to time series forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training deep models for time series forecasting is a critical task with an inherent challenge of time complexity. While current methods generally ensure linear time complexity, our observations on temporal redundancy show that high-level features are learned 98.44\% slower than low-level features. To address this issue, we introduce a new exponentially weighted stochastic gradient descent algorithm designed to achieve constant time complexity in deep learning models. We prove that the theoretical complexity of this learning method is constant. Evaluation of this method on Kernel U-Net (K-U-Net) on synthetic datasets shows a significant reduction in complexity while improving the accuracy of the test set.</description>

      <title>Personalized Federated Learning for Generative AI-Assisted Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic Communication (SC) focuses on transmitting only the semantic information rather than the raw data. This approach offers an efficient solution to the issue of spectrum resource utilization caused by the various intelligent applications on Mobile Users (MUs). Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models have recently exhibited remarkable content generation and signal processing capabilities, presenting new opportunities for enhancing SC. Therefore, we propose a GAI-assisted SC (GSC) model deployed between MUs and the Base Station (BS). Then, to train the GSC model using the local data of MUs while ensuring privacy and accommodating heterogeneous requirements of MUs, we introduce Personalized Semantic Federated Learning (PSFL). This approach incorporates a novel Personalized Local Distillation (PLD) and Adaptive Global Pruning (AGP). In PLD, each MU selects a personalized GSC model as a mentor tailored to its local resources and a unified Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based SC (CSC) model as a student. This mentor model is then distilled into the student model for global aggregation. In AGP, we perform network pruning on the aggregated global model according to real-time communication environments, reducing communication energy. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed PSFL scheme.</description>

      <title>Towards a Theoretical Understanding of Memorization in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) are being employed as mainstream models for Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), the study of their memorization of training data has attracted growing attention. Existing works in this direction aim to establish an understanding of whether or to what extent DPMs learn via memorization. Such an understanding is crucial for identifying potential risks of data leakage and copyright infringement in diffusion models and, more importantly, for trustworthy application of GenAI. Existing works revealed that conditional DPMs are more prone to training data memorization than unconditional DPMs, and the motivated data extraction methods are mostly for conditional DPMs. However, these understandings are primarily empirical, and extracting training data from unconditional models has been found to be extremely challenging. In this work, we provide a theoretical understanding of memorization in both conditional and unconditional DPMs under the assumption of model convergence. Our theoretical analysis indicates that extracting data from unconditional models can also be effective by constructing a proper surrogate condition. Based on this result, we propose a novel data extraction method named \textbf{Surrogate condItional Data Extraction (SIDE)} that leverages a time-dependent classifier trained on the generated data as a surrogate condition to extract training data from unconditional DPMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our SIDE can extract training data in challenging scenarios where previous methods fail, and it is, on average, over 50\% more effective across different scales of the CelebA dataset.</description>

      <title>Meta-Models: An Architecture for Decoding LLM Behaviors Through Interpreted Embeddings and Natural Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, the potential harms from deceptive behavior underlie the need for faithfully interpreting their decision-making. While traditional probing methods have shown some effectiveness, they remain best for narrowly scoped tasks while more comprehensive explanations are still necessary. To this end, we investigate meta-models-an architecture using a "meta-model" that takes activations from an "input-model" and answers natural language questions about the input-model's behaviors. We evaluate the meta-model's ability to generalize by training them on selected task types and assessing their out-of-distribution performance in deceptive scenarios. Our findings show that meta-models generalize well to out-of-distribution tasks and point towards opportunities for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Online Convex Optimization with a Separation Oracle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new projection-free algorithm for Online Convex Optimization (OCO) with a state-of-the-art regret guarantee among separation-based algorithms. Existing projection-free methods based on the classical Frank-Wolfe algorithm achieve a suboptimal regret bound of $O(T^{3/4})$, while more recent separation-based approaches guarantee a regret bound of $O(\kappa \sqrt{T})$, where $\kappa$ denotes the asphericity of the feasible set, defined as the ratio of the radii of the containing and contained balls. However, for ill-conditioned sets, $\kappa$ can be arbitrarily large, potentially leading to poor performance. Our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{dT} + \kappa d)$, while requiring only $\tilde{O}(1)$ calls to a separation oracle per round. Crucially, the main term in the bound, $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d T})$, is independent of $\kappa$, addressing the limitations of previous methods. Additionally, as a by-product of our analysis, we recover the $O(\kappa \sqrt{T})$ regret bound of existing OCO algorithms with a more straightforward analysis and improve the regret bound for projection-free online exp-concave optimization. Finally, for constrained stochastic convex optimization, we achieve a state-of-the-art convergence rate of $\tilde{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{T} + \kappa d/T)$, where $\sigma$ represents the noise in the stochastic gradients, while requiring only $\tilde{O}(1)$ calls to a separation oracle per iteration.</description>

      <title>Stochastic variance-reduced Gaussian variational inference on the Bures-Wasserstein manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization in the Bures-Wasserstein space has been gaining popularity in the machine learning community since it draws connections between variational inference and Wasserstein gradient flows. The variational inference objective function of Kullback-Leibler divergence can be written as the sum of the negative entropy and the potential energy, making forward-backward Euler the method of choice. Notably, the backward step admits a closed-form solution in this case, facilitating the practicality of the scheme. However, the forward step is no longer exact since the Bures-Wasserstein gradient of the potential energy involves "intractable" expectations. Recent approaches propose using the Monte Carlo method -- in practice a single-sample estimator -- to approximate these terms, resulting in high variance and poor performance. We propose a novel variance-reduced estimator based on the principle of control variates. We theoretically show that this estimator has a smaller variance than the Monte-Carlo estimator in scenarios of interest. We also prove that variance reduction helps improve the optimization bounds of the current analysis. We demonstrate that the proposed estimator gains order-of-magnitude improvements over the previous Bures-Wasserstein methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient learning of differential network in multi-source non-paranormal graphical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses learning of sparse structural changes or differential network between two classes of non-paranormal graphical models. We assume a multi-source and heterogeneous dataset is available for each class, where the covariance matrices are identical for all non-paranormal graphical models. The differential network, which are encoded by the difference precision matrix, can then be decoded by optimizing a lasso penalized D-trace loss function. To this aim, an efficient approach is proposed that outputs the exact solution path, outperforming the previous methods that only sample from the solution path in pre-selected regularization parameters. Notably, our proposed method has low computational complexity, especially when the differential network are sparse. Our simulations on synthetic data demonstrate a superior performance for our strategy in terms of speed and accuracy compared to an existing method. Moreover, our strategy in combining datasets from multiple sources is shown to be very effective in inferring differential network in real-world problems. This is backed by our experimental results on drug resistance in tumor cancers. In the latter case, our strategy outputs important genes for drug resistance which are already confirmed by various independent studies.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Gradient Alignment for Online Data Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The composition of training data mixtures is critical for effectively training large language models (LLMs), as it directly impacts their performance on downstream tasks. Our goal is to identify an optimal data mixture to specialize an LLM for a specific task with access to only a few examples. Traditional approaches to this problem include ad-hoc reweighting methods, importance sampling, and gradient alignment techniques. This paper focuses on gradient alignment and introduces Dynamic Gradient Alignment (DGA), a scalable online gradient alignment algorithm. DGA dynamically estimates the pre-training data mixture on which the models' gradients align as well as possible with those of the model on the specific task. DGA is the first gradient alignment approach that incurs minimal overhead compared to standard pre-training and outputs a competitive model, eliminating the need for retraining the model. Experimentally, we demonstrate significant improvements over importance sampling in two key scenarios: (i) when the pre-training set is small and importance sampling overfits due to limited data; and (ii) when there is insufficient specialized data, trapping importance sampling on narrow pockets of data. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of gradient alignment methods in optimizing training data mixtures, particularly in data-constrained environments, and offer a practical solution for enhancing LLM performance on specific tasks with limited data availability.</description>

Abstract: Data augmentation, a cornerstone technique in deep learning, is crucial in enhancing model performance, especially with scarce labeled data. While traditional techniques are effective, their reliance on hand-crafted methods limits their applicability across diverse data types and tasks. Although modern learnable augmentation methods offer increased adaptability, they are computationally expensive and challenging to incorporate within prevalent augmentation workflows. In this work, we present a novel, efficient method for data augmentation, effectively bridging the gap between existing augmentation strategies and emerging datasets and learning tasks. We introduce SAFLEX (Self-Adaptive Augmentation via Feature Label EXtrapolation), which learns the sample weights and soft labels of augmented samples provided by any given upstream augmentation pipeline, using a specifically designed efficient bilevel optimization algorithm. Remarkably, SAFLEX effectively reduces the noise and label errors of the upstream augmentation pipeline with a marginal computational cost. As a versatile module, SAFLEX excels across diverse datasets, including natural and medical images and tabular data, showcasing its prowess in few-shot learning and out-of-distribution generalization. SAFLEX seamlessly integrates with common augmentation strategies like RandAug, CutMix, and those from large pre-trained generative models like stable diffusion and is also compatible with frameworks such as CLIP's fine-tuning. Our findings highlight the potential to adapt existing augmentation pipelines for new data types and tasks, signaling a move towards more adaptable and resilient training frameworks.</description>

      <title>Minimax Group Fairness in Strategic Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In strategic classification, agents manipulate their features, at a cost, to receive a positive classification outcome from the learner's classifier. The goal of the learner in such settings is to learn a classifier that is robust to strategic manipulations. While the majority of works in this domain consider accuracy as the primary objective of the learner, in this work, we consider learning objectives that have group fairness guarantees in addition to accuracy guarantees. We work with the minimax group fairness notion that asks for minimizing the maximal group error rate across population groups.
  We formalize a fairness-aware Stackelberg game between a population of agents consisting of several groups, with each group having its own cost function, and a learner in the agnostic PAC setting in which the learner is working with a hypothesis class H. When the cost functions of the agents are separable, we show the existence of an efficient algorithm that finds an approximately optimal deterministic classifier for the learner when the number of groups is small. This algorithm remains efficient, both statistically and computationally, even when H is the set of all classifiers. We then consider cost functions that are not necessarily separable and show the existence of oracle-efficient algorithms that find approximately optimal randomized classifiers for the learner when H has finite strategic VC dimension. These algorithms work under the assumption that the learner is fully transparent: the learner draws a classifier from its distribution (randomized classifier) before the agents respond by manipulating their feature vectors. We highlight the effectiveness of such transparency in developing oracle-efficient algorithms. We conclude with verifying the efficacy of our algorithms on real data by conducting an experimental analysis.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Guided RL for Interpretable Feature Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of Machine Learning (ML) models strongly depends on the input data, as such generating high-quality features is often required to improve the predictive accuracy. This process is referred to as Feature Engineering (FE). However, since manual feature engineering is time-consuming and requires case-by-case domain knowledge, Automated Feature Engineering (AutoFE) is crucial. A major challenge that remains is to generate interpretable features. To tackle this problem, we introduce SMART, a hybrid approach that uses semantic technologies to guide the generation of interpretable features through a two-step process: Exploitation and Exploration. The former uses Description Logics (DL) to reason on the semantics embedded in Knowledge Graphs (KG) to infer domain-specific features, while the latter exploits the knowledge graph to conduct a guided exploration of the search space through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our experiments on public datasets demonstrate that SMART significantly improves prediction accuracy while ensuring a high level of interpretability.</description>

      <title>Fair Decentralized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized learning (DL) is an emerging approach that enables nodes to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing raw data. In many application domains, such as healthcare, this approach faces challenges due to the high level of heterogeneity in the training data's feature space. Such feature heterogeneity lowers model utility and negatively impacts fairness, particularly for nodes with under-represented training data. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{Facade}, a clustering-based DL algorithm specifically designed for fair model training when the training data exhibits several distinct features. The challenge of \textsc{Facade} is to assign nodes to clusters, one for each feature, based on the similarity in the features of their local data, without requiring individual nodes to know apriori which cluster they belong to. \textsc{Facade} (1) dynamically assigns nodes to their appropriate clusters over time, and (2) enables nodes to collaboratively train a specialized model for each cluster in a fully decentralized manner. We theoretically prove the convergence of \textsc{Facade}, implement our algorithm, and compare it against three state-of-the-art baselines. Our experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of model accuracy and fairness compared to all three competitors. Compared to the best-performing baseline, \textsc{Facade} on the CIFAR-10 dataset also reduces communication costs by 32.3\% to reach a target accuracy when cluster sizes are imbalanced.</description>

      <title>ColaCare: Enhancing Electronic Health Record Modeling through Large Language Model-Driven Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ColaCare, a framework that enhances Electronic Health Record (EHR) modeling through multi-agent collaboration driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach seamlessly integrates domain-specific expert models with LLMs to bridge the gap between structured EHR data and text-based reasoning. Inspired by clinical consultations, ColaCare employs two types of agents: DoctorAgent and MetaAgent, which collaboratively analyze patient data. Expert models process and generate predictions from numerical EHR data, while LLM agents produce reasoning references and decision-making reports within the collaborative consultation framework. We additionally incorporate the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy (MSD) medical guideline within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module for authoritative evidence support. Extensive experiments conducted on four distinct EHR datasets demonstrate ColaCare's superior performance in mortality prediction tasks, underscoring its potential to revolutionize clinical decision support systems and advance personalized precision medicine. The code, complete prompt templates, more case studies, etc. are publicly available at the anonymous link: https://colacare.netlify.app.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Suspension Dynamics Performance in Multi-Axle Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning-based framework for predicting the dynamic performance of suspension systems in multi-axle vehicles, emphasizing the integration of machine learning with traditional vehicle dynamics modeling. A Multi-Task Deep Belief Network Deep Neural Network (MTL-DBN-DNN) was developed to capture the relationships between key vehicle parameters and suspension performance metrics. The model was trained on data generated from numerical simulations and demonstrated superior prediction accuracy compared to conventional DNN models. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of various vehicle and suspension parameters on dynamic suspension performance. Additionally, the Suspension Dynamic Performance Index (SDPI) was introduced as a holistic measure to quantify overall suspension performance, accounting for the combined effects of multiple parameters. The findings highlight the effectiveness of multitask learning in improving predictive models for complex vehicle systems.</description>

      <title>Boosting Sample Efficiency and Generalization in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning via Equivariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) struggles with sample inefficiency and poor generalization [1]. These challenges are partially due to a lack of structure or inductive bias in the neural networks typically used in learning the policy. One such form of structure that is commonly observed in multi-agent scenarios is symmetry. The field of Geometric Deep Learning has developed Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNN) that are equivariant (or symmetric) to rotations, translations, and reflections of nodes. Incorporating equivariance has been shown to improve learning efficiency and decrease error [ 2 ]. In this paper, we demonstrate that EGNNs improve the sample efficiency and generalization in MARL. However, we also show that a naive application of EGNNs to MARL results in poor early exploration due to a bias in the EGNN structure. To mitigate this bias, we present Exploration-enhanced Equivariant Graph Neural Networks or E2GN2. We compare E2GN2 to other common function approximators using common MARL benchmarks MPE and SMACv2. E2GN2 demonstrates a significant improvement in sample efficiency, greater final reward convergence, and a 2x-5x gain in over standard GNNs in our generalization tests. These results pave the way for more reliable and effective solutions in complex multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Squared Error: Exploring Loss Design for Enhanced Training of Generative Flow Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are a novel class of generative models designed to sample from unnormalized distributions and have found applications in various important tasks, attracting great research interest in their training algorithms. In general, GFlowNets are trained by fitting the forward flow to the backward flow on sampled training objects. Prior work focused on the choice of training objects, parameterizations, sampling and resampling strategies, and backward policies, aiming to enhance credit assignment, exploration, or exploitation of the training process. However, the choice of regression loss, which can highly influence the exploration and exploitation behavior of the under-training policy, has been overlooked. Due to the lack of theoretical understanding for choosing an appropriate regression loss, most existing algorithms train the flow network by minimizing the squared error of the forward and backward flows in log-space, i.e., using the quadratic regression loss. In this work, we rigorously prove that distinct regression losses correspond to specific divergence measures, enabling us to design and analyze regression losses according to the desired properties of the corresponding divergence measures. Specifically, we examine two key properties: zero-forcing and zero-avoiding, where the former promotes exploitation and higher rewards, and the latter encourages exploration and enhances diversity. Based on our theoretical framework, we propose three novel regression losses, namely, Shifted-Cosh, Linex(1/2), and Linex(1). We evaluate them across three benchmarks: hyper-grid, bit-sequence generation, and molecule generation. Our proposed losses are compatible with most existing training algorithms, and significantly improve the performances of the algorithms concerning convergence speed, sample diversity, and robustness.</description>

      <title>Three-in-One: Fast and Accurate Transducer for Hybrid-Autoregressive ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present \textbf{H}ybrid-\textbf{A}utoregressive \textbf{IN}ference Tr\textbf{AN}sducers (HAINAN), a novel architecture for speech recognition that extends the Token-and-Duration Transducer (TDT) model. Trained with randomly masked predictor network outputs, HAINAN supports both autoregressive inference with all network components and non-autoregressive inference without the predictor. Additionally, we propose a novel semi-autoregressive inference paradigm that first generates an initial hypothesis using non-autoregressive inference, followed by refinement steps where each token prediction is regenerated using parallelized autoregression on the initial hypothesis. Experiments on multiple datasets across different languages demonstrate that HAINAN achieves efficiency parity with CTC in non-autoregressive mode and with TDT in autoregressive mode. In terms of accuracy, autoregressive HAINAN outperforms TDT and RNN-T, while non-autoregressive HAINAN significantly outperforms CTC. Semi-autoregressive inference further enhances the model's accuracy with minimal computational overhead, and even outperforms TDT results in some cases. These results highlight HAINAN's flexibility in balancing accuracy and speed, positioning it as a strong candidate for real-world speech recognition applications.</description>

      <title>Diffusion &amp; Adversarial Schr\"odinger Bridges via Iterative Proportional Markovian Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure based on iterative reciprocal and Markovian projections has recently been proposed as a powerful method for solving the Schr\"odinger Bridge problem. However, it has been observed that for the practical implementation of this procedure, it is crucial to alternate between fitting a forward and backward time diffusion at each iteration. Such implementation is thought to be a practical heuristic, which is required to stabilize training and obtain good results in applications such as unpaired domain translation. In our work, we show that this heuristic closely connects with the pioneer approaches for the Schr\"odinger Bridge based on the Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure. Namely, we find that the practical implementation of IMF is, in fact, a combination of IMF and IPF procedures, and we call this combination the Iterative Proportional Markovian Fitting (IPMF) procedure. We show both theoretically and practically that this combined IPMF procedure can converge under more general settings, thus, showing that the IPMF procedure opens a door towards developing a unified framework for solving Schr\"odinger Bridge problems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Expected Returns: A Policy Gradient Algorithm for Cumulative Prospect Theoretic Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widely used expected utility theory has been shown to be empirically inconsistent with human preferences in the psychology and behavioral economy literatures. Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) has been developed to fill in this gap and provide a better model for human-based decision-making supported by empirical evidence. It allows to express a wide range of attitudes and perceptions towards risk, gains and losses. A few years ago, CPT has been combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to formulate a CPT policy optimization problem where the goal of the agent is to search for a policy generating long-term returns which are aligned with their preferences. In this work, we revisit this policy optimization problem and provide new insights on optimal policies and their nature depending on the utility function under consideration. We further derive a novel policy gradient theorem for the CPT policy optimization objective generalizing the seminal corresponding result in standard RL. This result enables us to design a model-free policy gradient algorithm to solve the CPT-RL problem. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm in simple examples motivated by traffic control and electricity management applications. We also demonstrate that our policy gradient algorithm scales better to larger state spaces compared to the existing zeroth order algorithm for solving the same problem.</description>

      <title>LoGra-Med: Long Context Multi-Graph Alignment for Medical Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art medical multi-modal large language models (med-MLLM), like LLaVA-Med or BioMedGPT, leverage instruction-following data in pre-training. However, those models primarily focus on scaling the model size and data volume to boost performance while mainly relying on the autoregressive learning objectives. Surprisingly, we reveal that such learning schemes might result in a weak alignment between vision and language modalities, making these models highly reliant on extensive pre-training datasets - a significant challenge in medical domains due to the expensive and time-consuming nature of curating high-quality instruction-following instances. We address this with LoGra-Med, a new multi-graph alignment algorithm that enforces triplet correlations across image modalities, conversation-based descriptions, and extended captions. This helps the model capture contextual meaning, handle linguistic variability, and build cross-modal associations between visuals and text. To scale our approach, we designed an efficient end-to-end learning scheme using black-box gradient estimation, enabling faster LLaMa 7B training. Our results show LoGra-Med matches LLAVA-Med performance on 600K image-text pairs for Medical VQA and significantly outperforms it when trained on 10% of the data. For example, on VQA-RAD, we exceed LLAVA-Med by 20.13% and nearly match the 100% pre-training score (72.52% vs. 72.64%). We also surpass SOTA methods like BiomedGPT on visual chatbots and RadFM on zero-shot image classification with VQA, highlighting the effectiveness of multi-graph alignment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently-computable geometrical-topological invariant that characterizes the global shape of data. In this paper, we introduce the Local Euler Characteristic Transform ($\ell$-ECT), a novel extension of the ECT particularly designed to enhance expressivity and interpretability in graph representation learning. Unlike traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which may lose critical local details through aggregation, the $\ell$-ECT provides a lossless representation of local neighborhoods. This approach addresses key limitations in GNNs by preserving nuanced local structures while maintaining global interpretability. Moreover, we construct a rotation-invariant metric based on $\ell$-ECTs for spatial alignment of data spaces. Our method exhibits superior performance than standard GNNs on a variety of node classification tasks, particularly in graphs with high heterophily.</description>

      <title>Inverse Entropic Optimal Transport Solves Semi-supervised Learning via Data Likelihood Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning conditional distributions $\pi^*(\cdot|x)$ is a central problem in machine learning, which is typically approached via supervised methods with paired data $(x,y) \sim \pi^*$. However, acquiring paired data samples is often challenging, especially in problems such as domain translation. This necessitates the development of $\textit{semi-supervised}$ models that utilize both limited paired data and additional unpaired i.i.d. samples $x \sim \pi^*_x$ and $y \sim \pi^*_y$ from the marginal distributions. The usage of such combined data is complex and often relies on heuristic approaches. To tackle this issue, we propose a new learning paradigm that integrates both paired and unpaired data $\textbf{seamlessly}$ through the data likelihood maximization techniques. We demonstrate that our approach also connects intriguingly with inverse entropic optimal transport (OT). This finding allows us to apply recent advances in computational OT to establish a $\textbf{light}$ learning algorithm to get $\pi^*(\cdot|x)$. Furthermore, we demonstrate through empirical tests that our method effectively learns conditional distributions using paired and unpaired data simultaneously.</description>

Abstract: Accurate and timely modeling of labor migration is crucial for various urban governance and commercial tasks, such as local policy-making and business site selection. However, existing studies on labor migration largely rely on limited survey data with statistical methods, which fail to deliver timely and fine-grained insights for time-varying regional trends. To this end, we propose a deep learning-based spatial-temporal labor migration analysis framework, DHG-SIL, by leveraging large-scale job query data. Specifically, we first acquire labor migration intention as a proxy of labor migration via job queries from one of the world's largest search engines. Then, a Disprepant Homophily co-preserved Graph Convolutional Network (DH-GCN) and an interpretable temporal module are respectively proposed to capture cross-city and sequential labor migration dependencies. Besides, we introduce four interpretable variables to quantify city migration properties, which are co-optimized with city representations via tailor-designed contrastive losses. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our DHG-SIL. Notably, DHG-SIL has been deployed as a core component of a cooperative partner's intelligent human resource system, and the system supported a series of city talent attraction reports.</description>

      <title>Immunogenicity Prediction with Dual Attention Enables Vaccine Target Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Immunogenicity prediction is a central topic in reverse vaccinology for finding candidate vaccines that can trigger protective immune responses. Existing approaches typically rely on highly compressed features and simple model architectures, leading to limited prediction accuracy and poor generalizability. To address these challenges, we introduce ProVaccine, a novel deep learning solution with a dual attention mechanism that integrates pre-trained latent vector representations of protein sequences and structures. We also compile the most comprehensive immunogenicity dataset to date, encompassing over 9,500 antigen sequences, structures, and immunogenicity labels from bacteria, viruses, and tumors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProVaccine outperforms existing methods across a wide range of evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we establish a post-hoc validation protocol to assess the practical significance of deep learning models in tackling vaccine design challenges. Our work provides an effective tool for vaccine design and sets valuable benchmarks for future research.</description>

      <title>CAX: Cellular Automata Accelerated in JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular automata have become a cornerstone for investigating emergence and self-organization across diverse scientific disciplines, spanning neuroscience, artificial life, and theoretical physics. However, the absence of a hardware-accelerated cellular automata library limits the exploration of new research directions, hinders collaboration, and impedes reproducibility. In this work, we introduce CAX (Cellular Automata Accelerated in JAX), a high-performance and flexible open-source library designed to accelerate cellular automata research. CAX offers cutting-edge performance and a modular design through a user-friendly interface, and can support both discrete and continuous cellular automata with any number of dimensions. We demonstrate CAX's performance and flexibility through a wide range of benchmarks and applications. From classic models like elementary cellular automata and Conway's Game of Life to advanced applications such as growing neural cellular automata and self-classifying MNIST digits, CAX speeds up simulations up to 2,000 times faster. Furthermore, we demonstrate CAX's potential to accelerate research by presenting a collection of three novel cellular automata experiments, each implemented in just a few lines of code thanks to the library's modular architecture. Notably, we show that a simple one-dimensional cellular automaton can outperform GPT-4 on the 1D-ARC challenge.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing Recurrence, Attention, and Gating: Investigating the transferability of Transformers and Gated Recurrent Neural Networks in forecasting of dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning architectures, including transformers and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have revolutionized forecasting in applications ranging from text processing to extreme weather. Notably, advanced network architectures, tuned for applications such as natural language processing, are transferable to other tasks such as spatiotemporal forecasting tasks. However, there is a scarcity of ablation studies to illustrate the key components that enable this forecasting accuracy. The absence of such studies, although explainable due to the associated computational cost, intensifies the belief that these models ought to be considered as black boxes. In this work, we decompose the key architectural components of the most powerful neural architectures, namely gating and recurrence in RNNs, and attention mechanisms in transformers. Then, we synthesize and build novel hybrid architectures from the standard blocks, performing ablation studies to identify which mechanisms are effective for each task. The importance of considering these components as hyper-parameters that can augment the standard architectures is exhibited on various forecasting datasets, from the spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics of the multiscale Lorenz 96 system, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, as well as standard real world time-series benchmarks. A key finding is that neural gating and attention improves the performance of all standard RNNs in most tasks, while the addition of a notion of recurrence in transformers is detrimental. Furthermore, our study reveals that a novel, sparsely used, architecture which integrates Recurrent Highway Networks with neural gating and attention mechanisms, emerges as the best performing architecture in high-dimensional spatiotemporal forecasting of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable Simulation-free Entropic Unbalanced Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Optimal Transport (OT) problem investigates a transport map that connects two distributions while minimizing a given cost function. Finding such a transport map has diverse applications in machine learning, such as generative modeling and image-to-image translation. In this paper, we introduce a scalable and simulation-free approach for solving the Entropic Unbalanced Optimal Transport (EUOT) problem. We derive the dynamical form of this EUOT problem, which is a generalization of the Schr\"odinger bridges (SB) problem. Based on this, we derive dual formulation and optimality conditions of the EUOT problem from the stochastic optimal control interpretation. By leveraging these properties, we propose a simulation-free algorithm to solve EUOT, called Simulation-free EUOT (SF-EUOT). While existing SB models require expensive simulation costs during training and evaluation, our model achieves simulation-free training and one-step generation by utilizing the reciprocal property. Our model demonstrates significantly improved scalability in generative modeling and image-to-image translation tasks compared to previous SB methods.</description>

      <title>AlphaIntegrator: Transformer Action Search for Symbolic Integration Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first correct-by-construction learning-based system for step-by-step mathematical integration. The key idea is to learn a policy, represented by a GPT transformer model, which guides the search for the right mathematical integration rule, to be carried out by a symbolic solver. Concretely, we introduce a symbolic engine with axiomatically correct actions on mathematical expressions, as well as the first dataset for step-by-step integration. Our GPT-style transformer model, trained on this synthetic data, demonstrates strong generalization by surpassing its own data generator in accuracy and efficiency, using 50% fewer search steps. Our experimental results with SoTA LLMs also demonstrate that the standard approach of fine-tuning LLMs on a set of question-answer pairs is insufficient for solving this mathematical task. This motivates the importance of discovering creative methods for combining LLMs with symbolic reasoning engines, of which our work is an instance.</description>

      <title>GUD: Generation with Unified Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion generative models transform noise into data by inverting a process that progressively adds noise to data samples. Inspired by concepts from the renormalization group in physics, which analyzes systems across different scales, we revisit diffusion models by exploring three key design aspects: 1) the choice of representation in which the diffusion process operates (e.g. pixel-, PCA-, Fourier-, or wavelet-basis), 2) the prior distribution that data is transformed into during diffusion (e.g. Gaussian with covariance $\Sigma$), and 3) the scheduling of noise levels applied separately to different parts of the data, captured by a component-wise noise schedule. Incorporating the flexibility in these choices, we develop a unified framework for diffusion generative models with greatly enhanced design freedom. In particular, we introduce soft-conditioning models that smoothly interpolate between standard diffusion models and autoregressive models (in any basis), conceptually bridging these two approaches. Our framework opens up a wide design space which may lead to more efficient training and data generation, and paves the way to novel architectures integrating different generative approaches and generation tasks.</description>

      <title>FAN: Fourier Analysis Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable success achieved by neural networks, particularly those represented by MLP and Transformer, we reveal that they exhibit potential flaws in the modeling and reasoning of periodicity, i.e., they tend to memorize the periodic data rather than genuinely understanding the underlying principles of periodicity. However, periodicity is a crucial trait in various forms of reasoning and generalization, underpinning predictability across natural and engineered systems through recurring patterns in observations. In this paper, we propose FAN, a novel network architecture based on Fourier Analysis, which empowers the ability to efficiently model and reason about periodic phenomena. By introducing Fourier Series, the periodicity is naturally integrated into the structure and computational processes of the neural network, thus achieving a more accurate expression and prediction of periodic patterns. As a promising substitute to multi-layer perceptron (MLP), FAN can seamlessly replace MLP in various models with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FAN in modeling and reasoning about periodic functions, and the superiority and generalizability of FAN across a range of real-world tasks, including symbolic formula representation, time series forecasting, and language modeling.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Mitigating Miscalibration in Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confidence calibration is critical for the safe deployment of machine learning models in the real world. However, such issue in vision-language models like CLIP, particularly after fine-tuning, has not been fully addressed. In this work, we demonstrate that existing prompt tuning methods usually lead to a trade-off of calibration between base and new classes: the cross-entropy loss in CoOp causes overconfidence in new classes by increasing textual label divergence, whereas the regularization of KgCoOp maintains the confidence level but results in underconfidence in base classes due to the improved accuracy. Inspired by the observations, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Regularization (DOR) to ensure the confidence calibration on both base and new classes after fine-tuning. In particular, we propose to minimize the feature deviation of novel textual labels (instead of base classes) sampled from a large vocabulary. In effect, DOR prevents the increase in textual divergence for new labels while easing restrictions on base classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DOR can enhance the calibration performance of current fine-tuning methods on base and new classes.</description>

      <title>Lie Algebra Canonicalization: Equivariant Neural Operators under arbitrary Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest for robust and generalizable machine learning models has driven recent interest in exploiting symmetries through equivariant neural networks. In the context of PDE solvers, recent works have shown that Lie point symmetries can be a useful inductive bias for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) through data and loss augmentation. Despite this, directly enforcing equivariance within the model architecture for these problems remains elusive. This is because many PDEs admit non-compact symmetry groups, oftentimes not studied beyond their infinitesimal generators, making them incompatible with most existing equivariant architectures. In this work, we propose Lie aLgebrA Canonicalization (LieLAC), a novel approach that exploits only the action of infinitesimal generators of the symmetry group, circumventing the need for knowledge of the full group structure. To achieve this, we address existing theoretical issues in the canonicalization literature, establishing connections with frame averaging in the case of continuous non-compact groups. Operating within the framework of canonicalization, LieLAC can easily be integrated with unconstrained pre-trained models, transforming inputs to a canonical form before feeding them into the existing model, effectively aligning the input for model inference according to allowed symmetries. LieLAC utilizes standard Lie group descent schemes, achieving equivariance in pre-trained models. Finally, we showcase LieLAC's efficacy on tasks of invariant image classification and Lie point symmetry equivariant neural PDE solvers using pre-trained models.</description>

      <title>NETS: A Non-Equilibrium Transport Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm, termed the Non-Equilibrium Transport Sampler (NETS), to sample from unnormalized probability distributions. NETS can be viewed as a variant of annealed importance sampling (AIS) based on Jarzynski's equality, in which the stochastic differential equation used to perform the non-equilibrium sampling is augmented with an additional learned drift term that lowers the impact of the unbiasing weights used in AIS. We show that this drift is the minimizer of a variety of objective functions, which can all be estimated in an unbiased fashion without backpropagating through solutions of the stochastic differential equations governing the sampling. We also prove that some these objectives control the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the estimated distribution from its target. NETS is shown to be unbiased and, in addition, has a tunable diffusion coefficient which can be adjusted post-training to maximize the effective sample size. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method on standard benchmarks, high-dimensional Gaussian mixture distributions, and a model from statistical lattice field theory, for which it surpasses the performances of related work and existing baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug discovery is a complex and resource-intensive process, with significant time and cost investments required to bring new medicines to patients. Recent advancements in generative machine learning (ML) methods offer promising avenues to accelerate early-stage drug discovery by efficiently exploring chemical space. This paper addresses the gap between in silico generative approaches and practical in vitro methodologies, highlighting the need for their integration to optimize molecule discovery. We introduce SynthFormer, a novel ML model that utilizes a 3D equivariant encoder for pharmacophores to generate fully synthesizable molecules, constructed as synthetic trees. Unlike previous methods, SynthFormer incorporates 3D information and provides synthetic paths, enhancing its ability to produce molecules with good docking scores across various proteins. Our contributions include a new methodology for efficient chemical space exploration using 3D information, a novel architecture called Synthformer for translating 3D pharmacophore representations into molecules, and a meaningful embedding space that organizes reagents for drug discovery optimization. Synthformer generates molecules that dock well and enables effective late-stage optimization restricted by synthesis paths.</description>

      <title>Data Similarity-Based One-Shot Clustering for Multi-Task Hierarchical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of cluster identity estimation in a hierarchical federated learning setting in which users work toward learning different tasks. To overcome the challenge of task heterogeneity, users need to be grouped in a way such that users with the same task are in the same group, conducting training together, while sharing the weights of feature extraction layers with the other groups. Toward that end, we propose a one-shot clustering algorithm that can effectively identify and group users based on their data similarity. This enables more efficient collaboration and sharing of a common layer representation within the federated learning system. Our proposed algorithm not only enhances the clustering process, but also overcomes challenges related to privacy concerns, communication overhead, and the need for prior knowledge about learning models or loss function behaviors. We validate our proposed algorithm using various datasets such as CIFAR-10 and Fashion MNIST, and show that it outperforms the baseline in terms of accuracy and variance reduction.</description>

      <title>OOD-Chameleon: Is Algorithm Selection for OOD Generalization Learnable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization is challenging because distribution shifts come in many forms. A multitude of learning algorithms exist and each can improve performance in specific OOD situations. We posit that much of the challenge of OOD generalization lies in choosing the right algorithm for the right dataset. However, such algorithm selection is often elusive under complex real-world shifts. In this work, we formalize the task of algorithm selection for OOD generalization and investigate whether it could be approached by learning. We propose a solution, dubbed OOD-Chameleon that treats the task as a supervised classification over candidate algorithms. We construct a dataset of datasets to learn from, which represents diverse types, magnitudes and combinations of shifts (covariate shift, label shift, spurious correlations). We train the model to predict the relative performance of algorithms given a dataset's characteristics. This enables a priori selection of the best learning strategy, i.e. without training various models as needed with traditional model selection. Our experiments show that the adaptive selection outperforms any individual algorithm and simple selection heuristics, on unseen datasets of controllable and realistic image data. Inspecting the model shows that it learns non-trivial data/algorithms interactions, and reveals the conditions for any one algorithm to surpass another. This opens new avenues for (1) enhancing OOD generalization with existing algorithms instead of designing new ones, and (2) gaining insights into the applicability of existing algorithms with respect to datasets' properties.</description>

      <title>Training Language Models on Synthetic Edit Sequences Improves Code Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software engineers mainly write code by editing existing programs. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) autoregressively synthesize programs in a single pass. One explanation for this is the scarcity of open-sourced edit data. While high-quality instruction data for code synthesis is already scarce, high-quality edit data is even scarcer. To fill this gap, we develop a synthetic data generation algorithm called LintSeq. This algorithm refactors existing code into a sequence of code edits by using a linter to procedurally sample across the error-free insertions that can be used to sequentially write programs. It outputs edit sequences as text strings consisting of consecutive program diffs. To test LintSeq, we use it to refactor a dataset of instruction + program pairs into instruction + program-diff-sequence tuples. Then, we instruction finetune a series of smaller LLMs ranging from 2.6B to 14B parameters on both the re-factored and original versions of this dataset, comparing zero-shot performance on code synthesis benchmarks. We show that during repeated sampling, edit sequence finetuned models produce more diverse programs than baselines. This results in better inference-time scaling for benchmark coverage as a function of samples, i.e. the fraction of problems "pass@k" solved by any attempt given "k" tries. For example, on HumanEval pass@50, small LLMs finetuned on synthetic edit sequences are competitive with GPT-4 and outperform models finetuned on the baseline dataset by +20% (+/-3%) in absolute score. Finally, we also pretrain our own tiny LMs for code understanding. We show that finetuning tiny models on synthetic code edits results in state-of-the-art code synthesis for the on-device model class. Our 150M parameter edit sequence LM matches or outperforms code models with twice as many parameters, both with and without repeated sampling, including Codex and AlphaCode.</description>

      <title>An Online Automatic Modulation Classification Scheme Based on Isolation Distributional Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC), as a crucial technique in modern non-cooperative communication networks, plays a key role in various civil and military applications. However, existing AMC methods usually are complicated and can work in batch mode only due to their high computational complexity. This paper introduces a new online AMC scheme based on Isolation Distributional Kernel. Our method stands out in two aspects. Firstly, it is the first proposal to represent baseband signals using a distributional kernel. Secondly, it introduces a pioneering AMC technique that works well in online settings under realistic time-varying channel conditions. Through extensive experiments in online settings, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed classifier. Our results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms existing baseline models, including two state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers. Moreover, it distinguishes itself as the first online classifier for AMC with linear time complexity, which marks a significant efficiency boost for real-time applications.</description>

      <title>ReLIC: A Recipe for 64k Steps of In-Context Reinforcement Learning for Embodied AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent embodied agents need to quickly adapt to new scenarios by integrating long histories of experience into decision-making. For instance, a robot in an unfamiliar house initially wouldn't know the locations of objects needed for tasks and might perform inefficiently. However, as it gathers more experience, it should learn the layout of its environment and remember where objects are, allowing it to complete new tasks more efficiently. To enable such rapid adaptation to new tasks, we present ReLIC, a new approach for in-context reinforcement learning (RL) for embodied agents. With ReLIC, agents are capable of adapting to new environments using 64,000 steps of in-context experience with full attention while being trained through self-generated experience via RL. We achieve this by proposing a novel policy update scheme for on-policy RL called "partial updates'' as well as a Sink-KV mechanism that enables effective utilization of a long observation history for embodied agents. Our method outperforms a variety of meta-RL baselines in adapting to unseen houses in an embodied multi-object navigation task. In addition, we find that ReLIC is capable of few-shot imitation learning despite never being trained with expert demonstrations. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of ReLIC, highlighting that the combination of large-scale RL training, the proposed partial updates scheme, and the Sink-KV are essential for effective in-context learning. The code for ReLIC and all our experiments is at https://github.com/aielawady/relic</description>

Abstract: In this proof-of-concept study, we conduct multivariate timeseries forecasting for the concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and (fine) particulate matter (PM10 &amp; PM2.5) with meteorological covariates between two locations using various deep learning models, with a focus on long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) architectures. In particular, we propose an integrated, hierarchical model architecture inspired by air pollution dynamics and atmospheric science that employs multi-task learning and is benchmarked by unidirectional and fully-connected models. Results demonstrate that, above all, the hierarchical GRU proves itself as a competitive and efficient method for forecasting the concentration of smog-related pollutants.</description>

      <title>Democratizing Signal Processing and Machine Learning: Math Learning Equity for Elementary and Middle School Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signal Processing (SP) and Machine Learning (ML) rely on good math and coding knowledge, in particular, linear algebra, probability, and complex numbers. A good grasp of these relies on scalar algebra learned in middle school. The ability to understand and use scalar algebra well, in turn, relies on a good foundation in basic arithmetic. Because of various systemic barriers, many students are not able to build a strong foundation in arithmetic in elementary school. This leads them to struggle with algebra and everything after that. Since math learning is cumulative, the gap between those without a strong early foundation and everyone else keeps increasing over the school years and becomes difficult to fill in college. In this article we discuss how SP faculty and graduate students can play an important role in starting, and participating in, university-run (or other) out-of-school math support programs to supplement students' learning. Two example programs run by the authors (CyMath at ISU and Ab7G at Purdue) are briefly described. The second goal of this article is to use our perspective as SP, and engineering, educators who have seen the long-term impact of elementary school math teaching policies, to provide some simple almost zero cost suggestions that elementary schools could adopt to improve math learning: (i) more math practice in school, (ii) send small amounts of homework (individual work is critical in math), and (iii) parent awareness (math resources, need for early math foundation, clear in-school test information and sharing of feedback from the tests). In summary, good early math support (in school and through out-of-school programs) can help make SP and ML more accessible.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Predictive Coding: A Representation Learning Framework for WiFi Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WiFi sensing is an emerging technology that utilizes wireless signals for various sensing applications. However, the reliance on supervised learning, the scarcity of labelled data, and the incomprehensible channel state information (CSI) pose significant challenges. These issues affect deep learning models' performance and generalization across different environments. Consequently, self-supervised learning (SSL) is emerging as a promising strategy to extract meaningful data representations with minimal reliance on labelled samples. In this paper, we introduce a novel SSL framework called Context-Aware Predictive Coding (CAPC), which effectively learns from unlabelled data and adapts to diverse environments. CAPC integrates elements of Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) and the augmentation-based SSL method, Barlow Twins, promoting temporal and contextual consistency in data representations. This hybrid approach captures essential temporal information in CSI, crucial for tasks like human activity recognition (HAR), and ensures robustness against data distortions. Additionally, we propose a unique augmentation, employing both uplink and downlink CSI to isolate free space propagation effects and minimize the impact of electronic distortions of the transceiver. Our evaluations demonstrate that CAPC not only outperforms other SSL methods and supervised approaches, but also achieves superior generalization capabilities. Specifically, CAPC requires fewer labelled samples while significantly outperforming supervised learning and surpassing SSL baselines. Furthermore, our transfer learning studies on an unseen dataset with a different HAR task and environment showcase an accuracy improvement of 1.8 percent over other SSL baselines and 24.7 percent over supervised learning, emphasizing its exceptional cross-domain adaptability.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Convolutional Neural Network-based Image Classifications: A Multi-Featured Application for Rice Leaf Disease Prediction and Recommendations for Farmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel method for improving rice disease classification using 8 different convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms, which will further the field of precision agriculture. Tkinter-based application that offers farmers a feature-rich interface. With the help of this cutting-edge application, farmers will be able to make timely and well-informed decisions by enabling real-time disease prediction and providing personalized recommendations. Together with the user-friendly Tkinter interface, the smooth integration of cutting-edge CNN transfer learning algorithms-based technology that include ResNet-50, InceptionV3, VGG16, and MobileNetv2 with the UCI dataset represents a major advancement toward modernizing agricultural practices and guaranteeing sustainable crop management. Remarkable outcomes include 75% accuracy for ResNet-50, 90% accuracy for DenseNet121, 84% accuracy for VGG16, 95.83% accuracy for MobileNetV2, 91.61% accuracy for DenseNet169, and 86% accuracy for InceptionV3. These results give a concise summary of the models' capabilities, assisting researchers in choosing appropriate strategies for precise and successful rice crop disease identification. A severe overfitting has been seen on VGG19 with 70% accuracy and Nasnet with 80.02% accuracy. On Renset101, only an accuracy of 54% could be achieved, along with only 33% on efficientNetB0. A MobileNetV2-trained model was successfully deployed on a TKinter GUI application to make predictions using image or real-time video capture.</description>

      <title>Temporal Graph Memory Networks For Knowledge Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tracing a student's knowledge growth given the past exercise answering is a vital objective in automatic tutoring systems to customize the learning experience. Yet, achieving this objective is a non-trivial task as it involves modeling the knowledge state across multiple knowledge components (KCs) while considering their temporal and relational dynamics during the learning process. Knowledge tracing methods have tackled this task by either modeling KCs' temporal dynamics using recurrent models or relational dynamics across KCs and questions using graph models. Albeit, there is a lack of methods that could learn joint embedding between relational and temporal dynamics of the task. Moreover, many methods that count for the impact of a student's forgetting behavior during the learning process use hand-crafted features, limiting their generalization on different scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel method that jointly models the relational and temporal dynamics of the knowledge state using a deep temporal graph memory network. In addition, we propose a generic technique for representing a student's forgetting behavior using temporal decay constraints on the graph memory module. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using multiple knowledge tracing benchmarks while comparing it to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Public interest in science or bots? Selective amplification of scientific articles on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the remarkable capability to reach the public instantly, social media has become integral in sharing scholarly articles to measure public response. Since spamming by bots on social media can steer the conversation and present a false public interest in given research, affecting policies impacting the public's lives in the real world, this topic warrants critical study and attention. We used the Altmetric dataset in combination with data collected through the Twitter Application Programming Interface (API) and the Botometer API. We combined the data into an extensive dataset with academic articles, several features from the article and a label indicating whether the article had excessive bot activity on Twitter or not. We analyzed the data to see the possibility of bot activity based on different characteristics of the article. We also trained machine-learning models using this dataset to identify possible bot activity in any given article. Our machine-learning models were capable of identifying possible bot activity in any academic article with an accuracy of 0.70. We also found that articles related to "Health and Human Science" are more prone to bot activity compared to other research areas. Without arguing the maliciousness of the bot activity, our work presents a tool to identify the presence of bot activity in the dissemination of an academic article and creates a baseline for future research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Spatial Action Unit Cues for Interpretable Deep Facial Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although state-of-the-art classifiers for facial expression recognition (FER) can achieve a high level of accuracy, they lack interpretability, an important feature for end-users. Experts typically associate spatial action units (AUs) from a codebook to facial regions for the visual interpretation of expressions. In this paper, the same expert steps are followed. A new learning strategy is proposed to explicitly incorporate AU cues into classifier training, allowing to train deep interpretable models. During training, this AU codebook is used, along with the input image expression label, and facial landmarks, to construct a AU heatmap that indicates the most discriminative image regions of interest w.r.t the facial expression. This valuable spatial cue is leveraged to train a deep interpretable classifier for FER. This is achieved by constraining the spatial layer features of a classifier to be correlated with AU heatmaps. Using a composite loss, the classifier is trained to correctly classify an image while yielding interpretable visual layer-wise attention correlated with AU maps, simulating the expert decision process. Our strategy only relies on image class expression for supervision, without additional manual annotations. Our new strategy is generic, and can be applied to any deep CNN- or transformer-based classifier without requiring any architectural change or significant additional training time. Our extensive evaluation on two public benchmarks RAF-DB, and AffectNet datasets shows that our proposed strategy can improve layer-wise interpretability without degrading classification performance. In addition, we explore a common type of interpretable classifiers that rely on class activation mapping (CAM) methods, and show that our approach can also improve CAM interpretability.</description>

      <title>Recovering Time-Varying Networks From Single-Cell Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gene regulation is a dynamic process that underlies all aspects of human development, disease response, and other key biological processes. The reconstruction of temporal gene regulatory networks has conventionally relied on regression analysis, graphical models, or other types of relevance networks. With the large increase in time series single-cell data, new approaches are needed to address the unique scale and nature of this data for reconstructing such networks. Here, we develop a deep neural network, Marlene, to infer dynamic graphs from time series single-cell gene expression data. Marlene constructs directed gene networks using a self-attention mechanism where the weights evolve over time using recurrent units. By employing meta learning, the model is able to recover accurate temporal networks even for rare cell types. In addition, Marlene can identify gene interactions relevant to specific biological responses, including COVID-19 immune response, fibrosis, and aging.</description>

      <title>Long-range gene expression prediction with token alignment of large language model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gene expression is a cellular process that plays a fundamental role in human phenotypical variations and diseases. Despite advances of deep learning models for gene expression prediction, recent benchmarks have revealed their inability to learn distal regulatory grammar. Here, we address this challenge by leveraging a pretrained large language model to enhance gene expression prediction. We introduce Genetic sequence Token Alignment (GTA), which aligns genetic sequence features with natural language tokens, allowing for symbolic reasoning of genomic sequence features via the frozen language model. This cross-modal adaptation learns the regulatory grammar and allows us to further incorporate gene-specific human annotations as prompts, enabling in-context learning that is not possible with existing models. Trained on lymphoblastoid cells, GTA was evaluated on cells from the Geuvadis consortium and outperforms state-of-the-art models such as Enformer, achieving a Spearman correlation of 0.65, a 10\% improvement. Additionally, GTA offers improved interpretation of long-range interactions through the identification of the most meaningful sections of the input genetic context. GTA represents a powerful and novel cross-modal approach to gene expression prediction by utilizing a pretrained language model, in a paradigm shift from conventional gene expression models trained only on sequence data.</description>

      <title>Enhancing End Stage Renal Disease Outcome Prediction: A Multi-Sourced Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: To improve prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) progression to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models applied to an integrated clinical and claims dataset of varying observation windows, supported by explainable AI (XAI) to enhance interpretability and reduce bias.
  Materials and Methods: We utilized data about 10,326 CKD patients, combining their clinical and claims information from 2009 to 2018. Following data preprocessing, cohort identification, and feature engineering, we evaluated multiple statistical, ML and DL models using data extracted from five distinct observation windows. Feature importance and Shapley value analysis were employed to understand key predictors. Models were tested for robustness, clinical relevance, misclassification errors and bias issues.
  Results: Integrated data models outperformed those using single data sources, with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model achieving the highest AUC (0.93) and F1 score (0.65). A 24-month observation window was identified as optimal for balancing early detection and prediction accuracy. The 2021 eGFR equation improved prediction accuracy and reduced racial bias, notably for African American patients. Discussion: Improved ESRD prediction accuracy, results interpretability and bias mitigation strategies presented in this study have the potential to significantly enhance CKD and ESRD management, support targeted early interventions and reduce healthcare disparities.
  Conclusion: This study presents a robust framework for predicting ESRD outcomes in CKD patients, improving clinical decision-making and patient care through multi-sourced, integrated data and AI/ML methods. Future research will expand data integration and explore the application of this framework to other chronic diseases.</description>

      <title>FredNormer: Frequency Domain Normalization for Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent normalization-based methods have shown great success in tackling the distribution shift issue, facilitating non-stationary time series forecasting. Since these methods operate in the time domain, they may fail to fully capture the dynamic patterns that are more apparent in the frequency domain, leading to suboptimal results. This paper first theoretically analyzes how normalization methods affect frequency components. We prove that the current normalization methods that operate in the time domain uniformly scale non-zero frequencies, and thus, they struggle to determine components that contribute to more robust forecasting. Therefore, we propose FredNormer, which observes datasets from a frequency perspective and adaptively up-weights the key frequency components. To this end, FredNormer consists of two components: a statistical metric that normalizes the input samples based on their frequency stability and a learnable weighting layer that adjusts stability and introduces sample-specific variations. Notably, FredNormer is a plug-and-play module, which does not compromise the efficiency compared to existing normalization methods. Extensive experiments show that FredNormer improves the averaged MSE of backbone forecasting models by 33.3% and 55.3% on the ETTm2 dataset. Compared to the baseline normalization methods, FredNormer achieves 18 top-1 results and 6 top-2 results out of 28 settings.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Portfolio Rebalancing: A Hybrid new Model Using GNNs and Pathfinding for Cost Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to optimizing portfolio rebalancing by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for predicting transaction costs and Dijkstra's algorithm for identifying cost-efficient rebalancing paths. Using historical stock data from prominent technology firms, the GNN is trained to forecast future transaction costs, which are then applied as edge weights in a financial asset graph. Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the least costly path for reallocating capital between assets. Empirical results show that this hybrid approach significantly reduces transaction costs, offering a powerful tool for portfolio managers, especially in high-frequency trading environments. This methodology demonstrates the potential of combining advanced machine learning techniques with classical optimization algorithms to improve financial decision-making processes. Future research will explore expanding the asset universe and incorporating reinforcement learning for continuous portfolio optimization.</description>

      <title>Simplifying complex machine learning by linearly separable network embedding spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-dimensional embeddings are a cornerstone in the modelling and analysis of complex networks. However, most existing approaches for mining network embedding spaces rely on computationally intensive machine learning systems to facilitate downstream tasks. In the field of NLP, word embedding spaces capture semantic relationships \textit{linearly}, allowing for information retrieval using \textit{simple linear operations} on word embedding vectors. Here, we demonstrate that there are structural properties of network data that yields this linearity. We show that the more homophilic the network representation, the more linearly separable the corresponding network embedding space, yielding better downstream analysis results. Hence, we introduce novel graphlet-based methods enabling embedding of networks into more linearly separable spaces, allowing for their better mining. Our fundamental insights into the structure of network data that enable their \textit{\textbf{linear}} mining and exploitation enable the ML community to build upon, towards efficiently and explainably mining of the complex network data.</description>

      <title>Social Media Authentication and Combating Deepfakes using Semi-fragile Invisible Image Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the significant advances in deep generative models for image and video synthesis, Deepfakes and manipulated media have raised severe societal concerns. Conventional machine learning classifiers for deepfake detection often fail to cope with evolving deepfake generation technology and are susceptible to adversarial attacks. Alternatively, invisible image watermarking is being researched as a proactive defense technique that allows media authentication by verifying an invisible secret message embedded in the image pixels. A handful of invisible image watermarking techniques introduced for media authentication have proven vulnerable to basic image processing operations and watermark removal attacks. In response, we have proposed a semi-fragile image watermarking technique that embeds an invisible secret message into real images for media authentication. Our proposed watermarking framework is designed to be fragile to facial manipulations or tampering while being robust to benign image-processing operations and watermark removal attacks. This is facilitated through a unique architecture of our proposed technique consisting of critic and adversarial networks that enforce high image quality and resiliency to watermark removal efforts, respectively, along with the backbone encoder-decoder and the discriminator networks. Thorough experimental investigations on SOTA facial Deepfake datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can embed a $64$-bit secret as an imperceptible image watermark that can be recovered with a high-bit recovery accuracy when benign image processing operations are applied while being non-recoverable when unseen Deepfake manipulations are applied. In addition, our proposed watermarking technique demonstrates high resilience to several white-box and black-box watermark removal attacks. Thus, obtaining state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>LLM-Augmented Symbolic Reinforcement Learning with Landmark-Based Task Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental challenges in reinforcement learning (RL) is to take a complex task and be able to decompose it to subtasks that are simpler for the RL agent to learn. In this paper, we report on our work that would identify subtasks by using some given positive and negative trajectories for solving the complex task. We assume that the states are represented by first-order predicate logic using which we devise a novel algorithm to identify the subtasks. Then we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate first-order logic rule templates for achieving each subtask. Such rules were then further fined tuned to a rule-based policy via an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)-based RL agent. Through experiments, we verify the accuracy of our algorithm in detecting subtasks which successfully detect all of the subtasks correctly. We also investigated the quality of the common-sense rules produced by the language model to achieve the subtasks. Our experiments show that our LLM-guided rule template generation can produce rules that are necessary for solving a subtask, which leads to solving complex tasks with fewer assumptions about predefined first-order logic predicates of the environment.</description>

      <title>One-step Noisy Label Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mitigating the detrimental effects of noisy labels on the training process has become increasingly critical, as obtaining entirely clean or human-annotated samples for large-scale pre-training tasks is often impractical. Nonetheless, existing noise mitigation methods often encounter limitations in practical applications due to their task-specific design, model dependency, and significant computational overhead. In this work, we exploit the properties of high-dimensional orthogonality to identify a robust and effective boundary in cone space for separating clean and noisy samples. Building on this, we propose One-step Anti-Noise (OSA), a model-agnostic noisy label mitigation paradigm that employs an estimator model and a scoring function to assess the noise level of input pairs through just one-step inference, a cost-efficient process. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of OSA, highlighting its enhanced training robustness, improved task transferability, ease of deployment, and reduced computational costs across various benchmarks, models, and tasks. Our code is released at https://github.com/leolee99/OSA.</description>

      <title>Quantum-data-driven dynamical transition in quantum learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuits are an essential ingredient of quantum information processing. Parameterized quantum circuits optimized under a specific cost function -- quantum neural networks (QNNs) -- provide a paradigm for achieving quantum advantage in the near term. Understanding QNN training dynamics is crucial for optimizing their performance. In terms of supervised learning tasks such as classification and regression for large datasets, the role of quantum data in QNN training dynamics remains unclear. We reveal a quantum-data-driven dynamical transition, where the target value and data determine the polynomial or exponential convergence of the training. We analytically derive the complete classification of fixed points from the dynamical equation and reveal a comprehensive `phase diagram' featuring seven distinct dynamics. These dynamics originate from a bifurcation transition with multiple codimensions induced by training data, extending the transcritical bifurcation in simple optimization tasks. Furthermore, perturbative analyses identify an exponential convergence class and a polynomial convergence class among the seven dynamics. We provide a non-perturbative theory to explain the transition via generalized restricted Haar ensemble. The analytical results are confirmed with numerical simulations of QNN training and experimental verification on IBM quantum devices. As the QNN training dynamics is determined by the choice of the target value, our findings provide guidance on constructing the cost function to optimize the speed of convergence.</description>

      <title>Run-time Observation Interventions Make Vision-Language-Action Models More Visually Robust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models trained on large-scale internet data and robot demonstrations have the potential to serve as generalist robot policies. However, despite their large-scale training, VLAs are often brittle to task-irrelevant visual details such as distractor objects or background colors. We introduce Bring Your Own VLA (BYOVLA): a run-time intervention scheme that (1) dynamically identifies regions of the input image that the model is sensitive to, and (2) minimally alters task-irrelevant regions to reduce the model's sensitivity using automated image editing tools. Our approach is compatible with any off the shelf VLA without model fine-tuning or access to the model's weights. Hardware experiments on language-instructed manipulation tasks demonstrate that BYOVLA enables state-of-the-art VLA models to nearly retain their nominal performance in the presence of distractor objects and backgrounds, which otherwise degrade task success rates by up to 40%.

      <title>Auto-conditioned primal-dual hybrid gradient method and alternating direction method of multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Line search procedures are often employed in primal-dual methods for bilinear saddle point problems, especially when the norm of the linear operator is large or difficult to compute. In this paper, we demonstrate that line search is unnecessary by introducing a novel primal-dual method, the auto-conditioned primal-dual hybrid gradient (AC-PDHG) method, which achieves optimal complexity for solving bilinear saddle point problems. AC-PDHG is fully adaptive to the linear operator, using only past iterates to estimate its norm. We further tailor AC-PDHG to solve linearly constrained problems, providing convergence guarantees for both the optimality gap and constraint violation. Moreover, we explore an important class of linearly constrained problems where both the objective and constraints decompose into two parts. By incorporating the design principles of AC-PDHG into the preconditioned alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), we propose the auto-conditioned alternating direction method of multipliers (AC-ADMM), which guarantees convergence based solely on one part of the constraint matrix and fully adapts to it, eliminating the need for line search. Finally, we extend both AC-PDHG and AC-ADMM to solve bilinear problems with an additional smooth term. By integrating these methods with a novel acceleration scheme, we attain optimal iteration complexities under the single-oracle setting.</description>

      <title>Normalizing Flow Based Metric for Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose two new evaluation metrics to assess realness of generated images based on normalizing flows: a simpler and efficient flow-based likelihood distance (FLD) and a more exact dual-flow based likelihood distance (D-FLD). Because normalizing flows can be used to compute the exact likelihood, the proposed metrics assess how closely generated images align with the distribution of real images from a given domain. This property gives the proposed metrics a few advantages over the widely used Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) and other recent metrics. Firstly, the proposed metrics need only a few hundred images to stabilize (converge in mean), as opposed to tens of thousands needed for FID, and at least a few thousand for the other metrics. This allows confident evaluation of even small sets of generated images, such as validation batches inside training loops. Secondly, the network used to compute the proposed metric has over an order of magnitude fewer parameters compared to Inception-V3 used to compute FID, making it computationally more efficient. For assessing the realness of generated images in new domains (e.g., x-ray images), ideally these networks should be retrained on real images to model their distinct distributions. Thus, our smaller network will be even more advantageous for new domains. Extensive experiments show that the proposed metrics have the desired monotonic relationships with the extent of image degradation of various kinds.</description>

      <title>FLAG: Financial Long Document Classification via AMR-based GNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has initiated much research into their various financial applications. However, in applying LLMs on long documents, semantic relations are not explicitly incorporated, and a full or arbitrarily sparse attention operation is employed. In recent years, progress has been made in Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), which is a graph-based representation of text to preserve its semantic relations. Since AMR can represent semantic relationships at a deeper level, it can be beneficially utilized by graph neural networks (GNNs) for constructing effective document-level graph representations built upon LLM embeddings to predict target metrics in the financial domain. We propose FLAG: Financial Long document classification via AMR-based GNN, an AMR graph based framework to generate document-level embeddings for long financial document classification. We construct document-level graphs from sentence-level AMR graphs, endow them with specialized LLM word embeddings in the financial domain, apply a deep learning mechanism that utilizes a GNN, and examine the efficacy of our AMR-based approach in predicting labeled target data from long financial documents. Extensive experiments are conducted on a dataset of quarterly earnings calls transcripts of companies in various sectors of the economy, as well as on a corpus of more recent earnings calls of companies in the S&amp;P 1500 Composite Index. We find that our AMR-based approach outperforms fine-tuning LLMs directly on text in predicting stock price movement trends at different time horizons in both datasets. Our work also outperforms previous work utilizing document graphs and GNNs for text classification.</description>

      <title>A Likelihood Based Approach to Distribution Regression Using Conditional Deep Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the theoretical properties of conditional deep generative models under the statistical framework of distribution regression where the response variable lies in a high-dimensional ambient space but concentrates around a potentially lower-dimensional manifold. More specifically, we study the large-sample properties of a likelihood-based approach for estimating these models. Our results lead to the convergence rate of a sieve maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for estimating the conditional distribution (and its devolved counterpart) of the response given predictors in the Hellinger (Wasserstein) metric. Our rates depend solely on the intrinsic dimension and smoothness of the true conditional distribution. These findings provide an explanation of why conditional deep generative models can circumvent the curse of dimensionality from the perspective of statistical foundations and demonstrate that they can learn a broader class of nearly singular conditional distributions. Our analysis also emphasizes the importance of introducing a small noise perturbation to the data when they are supported sufficiently close to a manifold. Finally, in our numerical studies, we demonstrate the effective implementation of the proposed approach using both synthetic and real-world datasets, which also provide complementary validation to our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Impact of White-Box Adversarial Attacks on Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation and healthcare diagnostics are among the many fields where the reliability and security of machine learning models for image data are critical. We conduct a comprehensive investigation into the susceptibility of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are widely used for image data, to white-box adversarial attacks. We investigate the effects of various sophisticated attacks -- Fast Gradient Sign Method, Basic Iterative Method, Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack, Carlini &amp; Wagner, Projected Gradient Descent, and DeepFool -- on CNN performance metrics, (e.g., loss, accuracy), the differential efficacy of adversarial techniques in increasing error rates, the relationship between perceived image quality metrics (e.g., ERGAS, PSNR, SSIM, and SAM) and classification performance, and the comparative effectiveness of iterative versus single-step attacks. Using the MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Fashio_MNIST datasets, we explore the effect of different attacks on the CNNs performance metrics by varying the hyperparameters of CNNs. Our study provides insights into the robustness of CNNs against adversarial threats, pinpoints vulnerabilities, and underscores the urgent need for developing robust defense mechanisms to protect CNNs and ensuring their trustworthy deployment in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>PerTok: Expressive Encoding and Modeling of Symbolic Musical Ideas and Variations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Cadenza, a new multi-stage generative framework for predicting expressive variations of symbolic musical ideas as well as unconditional generations. To accomplish this we propose a novel MIDI encoding method, PerTok (Performance Tokenizer) that captures minute expressive details whilst reducing sequence length up to 59% and vocabulary size up to 95% for polyphonic, monophonic and rhythmic tasks. The proposed framework comprises of two sequential stages: 1) Composer and 2) Performer. The Composer model is a transformer-based Variational Autoencoder (VAE), with Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)ROPE and an autoregressive decoder modified to more effectively integrate the latent codes of the input musical idea. The Performer model is a bidirectional transformer encoder that is separately trained to predict velocities and microtimings on MIDI sequences. Objective and human evaluations demonstrate Cadenza's versatile capability in 1) matching other unconditional state-of-the-art symbolic models in musical quality whilst sounding more expressive, and 2) composing new, expressive ideas that are both stylistically related to the input whilst providing novel ideas to the user. Our framework is designed, researched and implemented with the objective of ethically providing inspiration for musicians.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a semi-supervised fine-tuning approach designed to improve the performance of foundation models on downstream tasks with limited labeled data. By leveraging content-style decomposition within an information-theoretic framework, our method enhances the latent representations of pre-trained vision foundation models, aligning them more effectively with specific task objectives and addressing the problem of distribution shift. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets, including MNIST, its augmented variations (with yellow and white stripes), CIFAR-10, SVHN, and GalaxyMNIST. The experiments show improvements over purely supervised baselines, particularly in low-labeled data regimes, across both frozen and trainable backbones for the majority of the tested datasets.</description>

      <title>Depth Pro: Sharp Monocular Metric Depth in Less Than a Second</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a foundation model for zero-shot metric monocular depth estimation. Our model, Depth Pro, synthesizes high-resolution depth maps with unparalleled sharpness and high-frequency details. The predictions are metric, with absolute scale, without relying on the availability of metadata such as camera intrinsics. And the model is fast, producing a 2.25-megapixel depth map in 0.3 seconds on a standard GPU. These characteristics are enabled by a number of technical contributions, including an efficient multi-scale vision transformer for dense prediction, a training protocol that combines real and synthetic datasets to achieve high metric accuracy alongside fine boundary tracing, dedicated evaluation metrics for boundary accuracy in estimated depth maps, and state-of-the-art focal length estimation from a single image. Extensive experiments analyze specific design choices and demonstrate that Depth Pro outperforms prior work along multiple dimensions.

      <title>Price-guided user attention in large-scale E-commerce group recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing group recommender systems utilize attention mechanisms to identify critical users who influence group decisions the most. We analyzed user attention scores from a widely-used group recommendation model on a real-world E-commerce dataset and found that item price and user interaction history significantly influence the selection of critical users. When item prices are low, users with extensive interaction histories are more influential in group decision-making. Conversely, their influence diminishes with higher item prices. Based on these observations, we propose a novel group recommendation approach that incorporates item price as a guiding factor for user aggregation. Our model employs an adaptive sigmoid function to adjust output logits based on item prices, enhancing the accuracy of user aggregation. Our model can be plugged into any attention-based group recommender system if the price information is available. We evaluate our model's performance on a public benchmark and a real-world dataset. We compare it with other state-of-the-art group recommendation methods. Our results demonstrate that our price-guided user attention approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of hit ratio and mean square error.</description>

      <title>Posterior sampling via Langevin dynamics based on generative priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Posterior sampling in high-dimensional spaces using generative models holds significant promise for various applications, including but not limited to inverse problems and guided generation tasks. Despite many recent developments, generating diverse posterior samples remains a challenge, as existing methods require restarting the entire generative process for each new sample, making the procedure computationally expensive. In this work, we propose efficient posterior sampling by simulating Langevin dynamics in the noise space of a pre-trained generative model. By exploiting the mapping between the noise and data spaces which can be provided by distilled flows or consistency models, our method enables seamless exploration of the posterior without the need to re-run the full sampling chain, drastically reducing computational overhead. Theoretically, we prove a guarantee for the proposed noise-space Langevin dynamics to approximate the posterior, assuming that the generative model sufficiently approximates the prior distribution. Our framework is experimentally validated on image restoration tasks involving noisy linear and nonlinear forward operators applied to LSUN-Bedroom (256 x 256) and ImageNet (64 x 64) datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach generates high-fidelity samples with enhanced semantic diversity even under a limited number of function evaluations, offering superior efficiency and performance compared to existing diffusion-based posterior sampling techniques.</description>

      <title>EMMA: Efficient Visual Alignment in Multi-Modal LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently exhibited impressive general-purpose capabilities by leveraging vision foundation models to encode the core concepts of images into representations. These are then combined with instructions and processed by the language model to generate high-quality responses. Despite significant progress in enhancing the language component, challenges persist in optimally fusing visual encodings within the language model for task-specific adaptability. Recent research has focused on improving this fusion through modality adaptation modules but at the cost of significantly increased model complexity and training data needs. In this paper, we propose EMMA (Efficient Multi-Modal Adaptation), a lightweight cross-modality module designed to efficiently fuse visual and textual encodings, generating instruction-aware visual representations for the language model. Our key contributions include: (1) an efficient early fusion mechanism that integrates vision and language representations with minimal added parameters (less than 0.2% increase in model size), (2) an in-depth interpretability analysis that sheds light on the internal mechanisms of the proposed method; (3) comprehensive experiments that demonstrate notable improvements on both specialized and general benchmarks for MLLMs. Empirical results show that EMMA boosts performance across multiple tasks by up to 9.3% while significantly improving robustness against hallucinations.

      <title>EC-DIT: Scaling Diffusion Transformers with Adaptive Expert-Choice Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion transformers have been widely adopted for text-to-image synthesis. While scaling these models up to billions of parameters shows promise, the effectiveness of scaling beyond current sizes remains underexplored and challenging. By explicitly exploiting the computational heterogeneity of image generations, we develop a new family of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models (EC-DIT) for diffusion transformers with expert-choice routing. EC-DIT learns to adaptively optimize the compute allocated to understand the input texts and generate the respective image patches, enabling heterogeneous computation aligned with varying text-image complexities. This heterogeneity provides an efficient way of scaling EC-DIT up to 97 billion parameters and achieving significant improvements in training convergence, text-to-image alignment, and overall generation quality over dense models and conventional MoE models. Through extensive ablations, we show that EC-DIT demonstrates superior scalability and adaptive compute allocation by recognizing varying textual importance through end-to-end training. Notably, in text-to-image alignment evaluation, our largest models achieve a state-of-the-art GenEval score of 71.68% and still maintain competitive inference speed with intuitive interpretability.</description>

      <title>A Watermark for Black-Box Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Watermarking has recently emerged as an effective strategy for detecting the outputs of large language models (LLMs). Most existing schemes require \emph{white-box} access to the model's next-token probability distribution, which is typically not accessible to downstream users of an LLM API. In this work, we propose a principled watermarking scheme that requires only the ability to sample sequences from the LLM (i.e. \emph{black-box} access), boasts a \emph{distortion-free} property, and can be chained or nested using multiple secret keys. We provide performance guarantees, demonstrate how it can be leveraged when white-box access is available, and show when it can outperform existing white-box schemes via comprehensive experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orientation estimation is a fundamental task in 3D shape analysis which consists of estimating a shape's orientation axes: its side-, up-, and front-axes. Using this data, one can rotate a shape into canonical orientation, where its orientation axes are aligned with the coordinate axes. Developing an orientation algorithm that reliably estimates complete orientations of general shapes remains an open problem. We introduce a two-stage orientation pipeline that achieves state of the art performance on up-axis estimation and further demonstrate its efficacy on full-orientation estimation, where one seeks all three orientation axes. Unlike previous work, we train and evaluate our method on all of Shapenet rather than a subset of classes. We motivate our engineering contributions by theory describing fundamental obstacles to orientation estimation for rotationally-symmetric shapes, and show how our method avoids these obstacles.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Reliably Simulate Human Learner Actions? A Simulation Authoring Framework for Open-Ended Learning Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating learner actions helps stress-test open-ended interactive learning environments and prototype new adaptations before deployment. While recent studies show the promise of using large language models (LLMs) for simulating human behavior, such approaches have not gone beyond rudimentary proof-of-concept stages due to key limitations. First, LLMs are highly sensitive to minor prompt variations, raising doubts about their ability to generalize to new scenarios without extensive prompt engineering. Moreover, apparently successful outcomes can often be unreliable, either because domain experts unintentionally guide LLMs to produce expected results, leading to self-fulfilling prophecies; or because the LLM has encountered highly similar scenarios in its training data, meaning that models may not be simulating behavior so much as regurgitating memorized content. To address these challenges, we propose Hyp-Mix, a simulation authoring framework that allows experts to develop and evaluate simulations by combining testable hypotheses about learner behavior. Testing this framework in a physics learning environment, we found that GPT-4 Turbo maintains calibrated behavior even as the underlying learner model changes, providing the first evidence that LLMs can be used to simulate realistic behaviors in open-ended interactive learning environments, a necessary prerequisite for useful LLM behavioral simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, performance of a lossy cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relay communication system is analyzed. In this system, the UAV relay adopts lossy forward (LF) strategy and the receiver has certain distortion requirements for the received information. For the system described above, we first derive the achievable rate distortion region of the system. Then, on the basis of the region analysis, the system outage probability when the channel suffers Nakagami-$m$ fading is analyzed. Finally, we design an optimal relay position identification algorithm based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, which determines the optimal UAV position to minimize the outage probability. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can optimize the UAV position and reduce the system outage probability effectively.</description>

      <title>SC-CDM: Enhancing Quality of Image Semantic Communication with a Compact Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic Communication (SC) is an emerging technology that has attracted much attention in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication systems. However, few literature has fully considered the perceptual quality of the reconstructed image. To solve this problem, we propose a generative SC for wireless image transmission (denoted as SC-CDM). This approach leverages compact diffusion models to improve the fidelity and semantic accuracy of the images reconstructed after transmission, ensuring that the essential content is preserved even in bandwidth-constrained environments. Specifically, we aim to redesign the swin Transformer as a new backbone for efficient semantic feature extraction and compression. Next, the receiver integrates the slim prior and image reconstruction networks. Compared to traditional Diffusion Models (DMs), it leverages DMs' robust distribution mapping capability to generate a compact condition vector, guiding image recovery, thus enhancing the perceptual details of the reconstructed images. Finally, a series of evaluation and ablation studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm and further increase the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) by over 17% on top of CNN-based DeepJSCC.</description>

      <title>BayesCNS: A Unified Bayesian Approach to Address Cold Start and Non-Stationarity in Search Systems at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information Retrieval (IR) systems used in search and recommendation platforms frequently employ Learning-to-Rank (LTR) models to rank items in response to user queries. These models heavily rely on features derived from user interactions, such as clicks and engagement data. This dependence introduces cold start issues for items lacking user engagement and poses challenges in adapting to non-stationary shifts in user behavior over time. We address both challenges holistically as an online learning problem and propose BayesCNS, a Bayesian approach designed to handle cold start and non-stationary distribution shifts in search systems at scale. BayesCNS achieves this by estimating prior distributions for user-item interactions, which are continuously updated with new user interactions gathered online. This online learning procedure is guided by a ranker model, enabling efficient exploration of relevant items using contextual information provided by the ranker. We successfully deployed BayesCNS in a large-scale search system and demonstrated its efficacy through comprehensive offline and online experiments. Notably, an online A/B experiment showed a 10.60% increase in new item interactions and a 1.05% improvement in overall success metrics over the existing production baseline.</description>

      <title>SoundMorpher: Perceptually-Uniform Sound Morphing with Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SoundMorpher, a sound morphing method that generates perceptually uniform morphing trajectories using a diffusion model. Traditional sound morphing methods models the intractable relationship between morph factor and perception of the stimuli for resulting sounds under a linear assumption, which oversimplifies the complex nature of sound perception and limits their morph quality. In contrast, SoundMorpher explores an explicit proportional mapping between the morph factor and the perceptual stimuli of morphed sounds based on Mel-spectrogram. This approach enables smoother transitions between intermediate sounds and ensures perceptually consistent transformations, which can be easily extended to diverse sound morphing tasks. Furthermore, we present a set of quantitative metrics to comprehensively assess sound morphing systems based on three objective criteria, namely, correspondence, perceptual intermediateness, and smoothness. We provide extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of SoundMorpher in real-world scenarios, highlighting its potential impact on various applications such as creative music composition, film post-production and interactive audio technologies.</description>

      <title>Reducing Warning Errors in Driver Support with Personalized Risk Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of human-focused driver support. State-of-the-art personalization concepts allow to estimate parameters for vehicle control systems or driver models. However, there are currently few approaches proposed that use personalized models and evaluate the effectiveness in the form of general risk warning. In this paper, we therefore propose a warning system that estimates a personalized risk factor for the given driver based on the driver's behavior. The system afterwards is able to adapt the warning signal with personalized Risk Maps. In experiments, we show examples for longitudinal following and intersection scenarios in which the novel warning system can effectively reduce false negative errors and false positive errors compared to a baseline approach which does not use personalized driver considerations. This underlines the potential of personalization for reducing warning errors in risk warning and driver support.</description>

      <title>RiskSEA : A Scalable Graph Embedding for Detecting On-chain Fraudulent Activities on the Ethereum Blockchain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Like any other useful technology, cryptocurrencies are sometimes used for criminal activities. While transactions are recorded on the blockchain, there exists a need for a more rapid and scalable method to detect addresses associated with fraudulent activities. We present RiskSEA, a scalable risk scoring system capable of effectively handling the dynamic nature of large-scale blockchain transaction graphs. The risk scoring system, which we implement for Ethereum, consists of 1. a scalable approach to generating node2vec embedding for entire set of addresses to capture the graph topology 2. transaction-based features to capture the transactional behavioral pattern of an address 3. a classifier model to generate risk score for addresses that combines the node2vec embedding and behavioral features. Efficiently generating node2vec embedding for large scale and dynamically evolving blockchain transaction graphs is challenging, we present two novel approaches for generating node2vec embeddings and effectively scaling it to the entire set of blockchain addresses: 1. node2vec embedding propagation and 2. dynamic node2vec embedding. We present a comprehensive analysis of the proposed approaches. Our experiments show that combining both behavioral and node2vec features boosts the classification performance significantly, and that the dynamic node2vec embeddings perform better than the node2vec propagated embeddings.</description>

Abstract: Recent work showed that retrieval based on embedding similarity (e.g., for retrieval-augmented generation) is vulnerable to poisoning: an adversary can craft malicious documents that are retrieved in response to broad classes of queries. We demonstrate that previous, HotFlip-based techniques produce documents that are very easy to detect using perplexity filtering. Even if generation is constrained to produce low-perplexity text, the resulting documents are recognized as unnatural by LLMs and can be automatically filtered from the retrieval corpus.
  We design, implement, and evaluate a new controlled generation technique that combines an adversarial objective (embedding similarity) with a "naturalness" objective based on soft scores computed using an open-source, surrogate LLM. The resulting adversarial documents (1) cannot be automatically detected using perplexity filtering and/or other LLMs, except at the cost of significant false positives in the retrieval corpus, yet (2) achieve similar poisoning efficacy to easily-detectable documents generated using HotFlip, and (3) are significantly more effective than prior methods for energy-guided generation, such as COLD.</description>

      <title>HATFormer: Historic Handwritten Arabic Text Recognition with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arabic handwritten text recognition (HTR) is challenging, especially for historical texts, due to diverse writing styles and the intrinsic features of Arabic script. Additionally, Arabic handwriting datasets are smaller compared to English ones, making it difficult to train generalizable Arabic HTR models. To address these challenges, we propose HATFormer, a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture that builds on a state-of-the-art English HTR model. By leveraging the transformer's attention mechanism, HATFormer captures spatial contextual information to address the intrinsic challenges of Arabic script through differentiating cursive characters, decomposing visual representations, and identifying diacritics. Our customization to historical handwritten Arabic includes an image processor for effective ViT information preprocessing, a text tokenizer for compact Arabic text representation, and a training pipeline that accounts for a limited amount of historic Arabic handwriting data. HATFormer achieves a character error rate (CER) of 8.6% on the largest public historical handwritten Arabic dataset, with a 51% improvement over the best baseline in the literature. HATFormer also attains a comparable CER of 4.2% on the largest private non-historical dataset. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of adapting an English HTR method to a low-resource language with complex, language-specific challenges, contributing to advancements in document digitization, information retrieval, and cultural preservation.</description>

      <title>BadCM: Invisible Backdoor Attack Against Cross-Modal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite remarkable successes in unimodal learning tasks, backdoor attacks against cross-modal learning are still underexplored due to the limited generalization and inferior stealthiness when involving multiple modalities. Notably, since works in this area mainly inherit ideas from unimodal visual attacks, they struggle with dealing with diverse cross-modal attack circumstances and manipulating imperceptible trigger samples, which hinders their practicability in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel bilateral backdoor to fill in the missing pieces of the puzzle in the cross-modal backdoor and propose a generalized invisible backdoor framework against cross-modal learning (BadCM). Specifically, a cross-modal mining scheme is developed to capture the modality-invariant components as target poisoning areas, where well-designed trigger patterns injected into these regions can be efficiently recognized by the victim models. This strategy is adapted to different image-text cross-modal models, making our framework available to various attack scenarios. Furthermore, for generating poisoned samples of high stealthiness, we conceive modality-specific generators for visual and linguistic modalities that facilitate hiding explicit trigger patterns in modality-invariant regions. To the best of our knowledge, BadCM is the first invisible backdoor method deliberately designed for diverse cross-modal attacks within one unified framework. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on two typical applications, i.e., cross-modal retrieval and VQA, demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method under multiple kinds of attack scenarios. Moreover, we show that BadCM can robustly evade existing backdoor defenses. Our code is available at https://github.com/xandery-geek/BadCM.</description>

      <title>POSIX: A Prompt Sensitivity Index For Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are found to be surprisingly sensitive to minor variations in prompts, often generating significantly divergent outputs in response to minor variations in the prompts, such as spelling errors, alteration of wording or the prompt template. However, while assessing the quality of an LLM, the focus often tends to be solely on its performance on downstream tasks, while very little to no attention is paid to prompt sensitivity. To fill this gap, we propose POSIX - a novel PrOmpt Sensitivity IndeX as a reliable measure of prompt sensitivity, thereby offering a more comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance. The key idea behind POSIX is to capture the relative change in loglikelihood of a given response upon replacing the corresponding prompt with a different intent-preserving prompt. We provide thorough empirical evidence demonstrating the efficacy of POSIX in capturing prompt sensitivity and subsequently use it to measure and thereby compare prompt sensitivity of various open-source LLMs. We find that merely increasing the parameter count or instruction tuning does not necessarily reduce prompt sensitivity whereas adding some few-shot exemplars, even just one, almost always leads to significant decrease in prompt sensitivity. We also find that alterations to prompt template lead to the highest sensitivity in the case of MCQtype tasks, whereas paraphrasing results in the highest sensitivity in open-ended generation tasks. The code for reproducing our results is open-sourced at https://github.com/kowndinyarenduchintala/POSIX.</description>

      <title>Agent-Oriented Planning in Multi-Agent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through the collaboration of multiple agents possessing diverse expertise and tools, multi-agent systems achieve impressive progress in solving real-world problems. Given the user queries, the meta-agents, serving as the brain within these systems, are required to decompose the queries into multiple sub-tasks that can be allocated to suitable agents capable of solving them, so-called agent-oriented planning. In this study, we identify three critical design principles of agent-oriented planning, including solvability, completeness, and non-redundancy, to ensure that each sub-task is effectively resolved, leading to satisfactory responses to the original queries. These principles further inspire us to propose a novel framework for agent-oriented planning in multi-agent systems, leveraging a fast task decomposition and allocation process followed by an effective and efficient evaluation via a reward model. During the planning process, the meta-agent is also responsible for evaluating the performance of the expert agents, making timely adjustments to the sub-tasks and scheduling as necessary. Besides, we integrate a feedback loop into the proposed framework to further enhance the effectiveness and robustness of such a problem-solving process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advancement of the proposed framework in solving real-world problems compared to both single-agent systems and existing planning strategies for multi-agent systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of smartphones and Location-Based Social Networks has led to a massive influx of spatio-temporal data, creating unparalleled opportunities for enhancing Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation systems. These advanced POI systems are crucial for enriching user experiences, enabling personalized interactions, and optimizing decision-making processes in the digital landscape. However, existing surveys tend to focus on traditional approaches and few of them delve into cutting-edge developments, emerging architectures, as well as security considerations in POI recommendations. To address this gap, our survey stands out by offering a comprehensive, up-to-date review of POI recommendation systems, covering advancements in models, architectures, and security aspects. We systematically examine the transition from traditional models to advanced techniques such as large language models. Additionally, we explore the architectural evolution from centralized to decentralized and federated learning systems, highlighting the improvements in scalability and privacy. Furthermore, we address the increasing importance of security, examining potential vulnerabilities and privacy-preserving approaches. Our taxonomy provides a structured overview of the current state of POI recommendation, while we also identify promising directions for future research in this rapidly advancing field.</description>

      <title>General Preference Modeling with Preference Representations for Aligning Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling human preferences is crucial for aligning foundation models with human values. Traditional reward modeling methods, such as the Bradley-Terry (BT) reward model, fall short in expressiveness, particularly in addressing intransitive preferences. Although supervised pair preference models (PairPM) can express general preferences, their implementation is highly ad-hoc and cannot guarantee a consistent preference probability of compared pairs. Additionally, they impose high computational costs due to their quadratic query complexity when comparing multiple responses. In this paper, we introduce preference representation learning, an approach that embeds responses into a latent space to capture intricate preference structures efficiently, achieving linear query complexity. Additionally, we propose preference score-based General Preference Optimization (GPO), which generalizes reward-based reinforcement learning from human feedback. Experimental results show that our General Preference representation model (GPM) outperforms the BT reward model on the RewardBench benchmark with a margin of up to 5.6% and effectively models cyclic preferences where any BT reward model behaves like a random guess. Furthermore, evaluations on downstream tasks such as AlpacaEval2.0 and MT-Bench, following the language model post-training with GPO and our general preference model, reveal substantial performance improvements with margins up to 9.3%. These findings indicate that our method may enhance the alignment of foundation models with nuanced human values.

      <title>Adapting Segment Anything Model to Melanoma Segmentation in Microscopy Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Melanoma segmentation in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is useful for prognosis and the measurement of crucial prognostic factors such as Breslow depth and primary invasive tumor size. In this paper, we present a novel approach that uses the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for automatic melanoma segmentation in microscopy slide images. Our method employs an initial semantic segmentation model to generate preliminary segmentation masks that are then used to prompt SAM. We design a dynamic prompting strategy that uses a combination of centroid and grid prompts to achieve optimal coverage of the super high-resolution slide images while maintaining the quality of generated prompts. To optimize for invasive melanoma segmentation, we further refine the prompt generation process by implementing in-situ melanoma detection and low-confidence region filtering. We select Segformer as the initial segmentation model and EfficientSAM as the segment anything model for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only surpasses other state-of-the-art melanoma segmentation methods but also significantly outperforms the baseline Segformer by 9.1% in terms of IoU.</description>

      <title>Fast nonparametric feature selection with error control using integrated path stability selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature selection can greatly improve performance and interpretability in machine learning problems. However, existing nonparametric feature selection methods either lack theoretical error control or fail to accurately control errors in practice. Many methods are also slow, especially in high dimensions. In this paper, we introduce a general feature selection method that applies integrated path stability selection to thresholding to control false positives and the false discovery rate. The method also estimates q-values, which are better suited to high-dimensional data than p-values. We focus on two special cases of the general method based on gradient boosting (IPSSGB) and random forests (IPSSRF). Extensive simulations with RNA sequencing data show that IPSSGB and IPSSRF have better error control, detect more true positives, and are faster than existing methods. We also use both methods to detect microRNAs and genes related to ovarian cancer, finding that they make better predictions with fewer features than other methods.</description>

      <title>Calibrate to Discriminate: Improve In-Context Learning with Label-Free Comparative Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While in-context learning with large language models (LLMs) has shown impressive performance, we have discovered a unique miscalibration behavior where both correct and incorrect predictions are assigned the same level of confidence. We refer to this phenomenon as indiscriminate miscalibration. We found that traditional calibration metrics, such as Expected Calibrated Errors (ECEs), are unable to capture this behavior effectively. To address this issue, we propose new metrics to measure the severity of indiscriminate miscalibration. Additionally, we develop a novel in-context comparative inference method to alleviate miscalibrations and improve classification performance. Through extensive experiments on five datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve more accurate and calibrated predictions compared to regular zero-shot and few-shot prompting.</description>

      <title>Capturing complex hand movements and object interactions using machine learning-powered stretchable smart textile gloves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate real-time tracking of dexterous hand movements and interactions has numerous applications in human-computer interaction, metaverse, robotics, and tele-health. Capturing realistic hand movements is challenging because of the large number of articulations and degrees of freedom. Here, we report accurate and dynamic tracking of articulated hand and finger movements using stretchable, washable smart gloves with embedded helical sensor yarns and inertial measurement units. The sensor yarns have a high dynamic range, responding to low 0.005 % to high 155 % strains, and show stability during extensive use and washing cycles. We use multi-stage machine learning to report average joint angle estimation root mean square errors of 1.21 and 1.45 degrees for intra- and inter-subjects cross-validation, respectively, matching accuracy of costly motion capture cameras without occlusion or field of view limitations. We report a data augmentation technique that enhances robustness to noise and variations of sensors. We demonstrate accurate tracking of dexterous hand movements during object interactions, opening new avenues of applications including accurate typing on a mock paper keyboard, recognition of complex dynamic and static gestures adapted from American Sign Language and object identification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With hundreds of thousands of language models available on Huggingface today, efficiently evaluating and utilizing these models across various downstream, tasks has become increasingly critical. Many existing methods repeatedly learn task-specific representations of Large Language Models (LLMs), which leads to inefficiencies in both time and computational resources. To address this, we propose EmbedLLM, a framework designed to learn compact vector representations, of LLMs that facilitate downstream applications involving many models, such as model routing. We introduce an encoder-decoder approach for learning such embeddings, along with a systematic framework to evaluate their effectiveness. Empirical results show that EmbedLLM outperforms prior methods in model routing both in accuracy and latency. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can forecast a model's performance on multiple benchmarks, without incurring additional inference cost. Extensive probing experiments validate that the learned embeddings capture key model characteristics, e.g. whether the model is specialized for coding tasks, even without being explicitly trained on them. We open source our dataset, code and embedder to facilitate further research and application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical Imitation Learning (HIL) is a promising approach for tackling long-horizon decision-making tasks. While it is a challenging task due to the lack of detailed supervisory labels for sub-goal learning, and reliance on hundreds to thousands of expert demonstrations. In this work, we introduce SEAL, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs)'s powerful semantic and world knowledge for both specifying sub-goal space and pre-labeling states to semantically meaningful sub-goal representations without prior knowledge of task hierarchies. SEAL employs a dual-encoder structure, combining supervised LLM-guided sub-goal learning with unsupervised Vector Quantization (VQ) for more robust sub-goal representations. Additionally, SEAL incorporates a transition-augmented low-level planner for improved adaptation to sub-goal transitions. Our experiments demonstrate that SEAL outperforms state-of-the-art HIL methods and LLM-based planning approaches, particularly in settings with small expert datasets and complex long-horizon tasks.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic road classification in historical maps using synthetic data and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historical maps are invaluable for analyzing long-term changes in transportation and spatial development, offering a rich source of data for evolutionary studies. However, digitizing and classifying road networks from these maps is often expensive and time-consuming, limiting their widespread use. Recent advancements in deep learning have made automatic road extraction from historical maps feasible, yet these methods typically require large amounts of labeled training data. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework that integrates deep learning with geoinformation, computer-based painting, and image processing methodologies. This framework enables the extraction and classification of roads from historical maps using only road geometries without needing road class labels for training. The process begins with training of a binary segmentation model to extract road geometries, followed by morphological operations, skeletonization, vectorization, and filtering algorithms. Synthetic training data is then generated by a painting function that artificially re-paints road segments using predefined symbology for road classes. Using this synthetic data, a deep ensemble is trained to generate pixel-wise probabilities for road classes to mitigate distribution shift. These predictions are then discretized along the extracted road geometries. Subsequently, further processing is employed to classify entire roads, enabling the identification of potential changes in road classes and resulting in a labeled road class dataset. Our method achieved completeness and correctness scores of over 94% and 92%, respectively, for road class 2, the most prevalent class in the two Siegfried Map sheets from Switzerland used for testing. This research offers a powerful tool for urban planning and transportation decision-making by efficiently extracting and classifying roads from historical maps.</description>

      <title>End-to-end Driving in High-Interaction Traffic Scenarios with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic and interactive traffic scenarios pose significant challenges for autonomous driving systems. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach by enabling the exploration of driving policies beyond the constraints of pre-collected datasets and predefined conditions, particularly in complex environments. However, a critical challenge lies in effectively extracting spatial and temporal features from sequences of high-dimensional, multi-modal observations while minimizing the accumulation of errors over time. Additionally, efficiently guiding large-scale RL models to converge on optimal driving policies without frequent failures during the training process remains tricky.
  We propose an end-to-end model-based RL algorithm named Ramble to address these issues. Ramble processes multi-view RGB images and LiDAR point clouds into low-dimensional latent features to capture the context of traffic scenarios at each time step. A transformer-based architecture is then employed to model temporal dependencies and predict future states. By learning a dynamics model of the environment, Ramble can foresee upcoming traffic events and make more informed, strategic decisions. Our implementation demonstrates that prior experience in feature extraction and decision-making plays a pivotal role in accelerating the convergence of RL models toward optimal driving policies. Ramble achieves state-of-the-art performance regarding route completion rate and driving score on the CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, showcasing its effectiveness in managing complex and dynamic traffic situations.</description>

      <title>Can Capacitive Touch Images Enhance Mobile Keyboard Decoding?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capacitive touch sensors capture the two-dimensional spatial profile (referred to as a touch heatmap) of a finger's contact with a mobile touchscreen. However, the research and design of touchscreen mobile keyboards -- one of the most speed and accuracy demanding touch interfaces -- has focused on the location of the touch centroid derived from the touch image heatmap as the input, discarding the rest of the raw spatial signals. In this paper, we investigate whether touch heatmaps can be leveraged to further improve the tap decoding accuracy for mobile touchscreen keyboards. Specifically, we developed and evaluated machine-learning models that interpret user taps by using the centroids and/or the heatmaps as their input and studied the contribution of the heatmaps to model performance. The results show that adding the heatmap into the input feature set led to 21.4% relative reduction of character error rates on average, compared to using the centroid alone. Furthermore, we conducted a live user study with the centroid-based and heatmap-based decoders built into Pixel 6 Pro devices and observed lower error rate, faster typing speed, and higher self-reported satisfaction score based on the heatmap-based decoder than the centroid-based decoder. These findings underline the promise of utilizing touch heatmaps for improving typing experience in mobile keyboards.</description>

      <title>On Lai's Upper Confidence Bound in Multi-Armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this memorial paper, we honor Tze Leung Lai's seminal contributions to the topic of multi-armed bandits, with a specific focus on his pioneering work on the upper confidence bound. We establish sharp non-asymptotic regret bounds for an upper confidence bound index with a constant level of exploration for Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we establish a non-asymptotic regret bound for the upper confidence bound index of \cite{lai1987adaptive} which employs an exploration function that decreases with the sample size of the corresponding arm. The regret bounds have leading constants that match the Lai-Robbins lower bound. Our results highlight an aspect of Lai's seminal works that deserves more attention in the machine learning literature.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication and Control Co-Design for Multi-Objective Correlated Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter introduces a machine-learning approach to learning the semantic dynamics of correlated systems with different control rules and dynamics. By leveraging the Koopman operator in an autoencoder (AE) framework, the system's state evolution is linearized in the latent space using a dynamic semantic Koopman (DSK) model, capturing the baseline semantic dynamics. Signal temporal logic (STL) is incorporated through a logical semantic Koopman (LSK) model to encode system-specific control rules. These models form the proposed logical Koopman AE framework that reduces communication costs while improving state prediction accuracy and control performance, showing a 91.65% reduction in communication samples and significant performance gains in simulation.</description>

      <title>A novel neural network-based approach to derive a geomagnetic baseline for robust characterization of geomagnetic indices at mid-latitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geomagnetic indices derived from ground magnetic measurements characterize the intensity of solar-terrestrial interaction. The \textit{Kp} index derived from multiple magnetic observatories at mid-latitude has commonly been used for space weather operations. Yet, its temporal cadence is low and its intensity scale is crude. To derive a new generation of geomagnetic indices, it is desirable to establish a geomagnetic `baseline' that defines the quiet-level of activity without solar-driven perturbations. We present a new approach for deriving a baseline that represents the time-dependent quiet variations focusing on data from Chambon-la-For\^et, France. Using a filtering technique, the measurements are first decomposed into the above-diurnal variation and the sum of 24h, 12h, 8h, and 6h filters, called the daily variation. Using correlation tools and SHapley Additive exPlanations, we identify parameters that dominantly correlate with the daily variation. Here, we predict the daily `quiet' variation using a long short-term memory neural network trained using at least 11 years of data at 1h cadence. This predicted daily quiet variation is combined with linear extrapolation of the secular trend associated with the intrinsic geomagnetic variability, which dominates the above-diurnal variation, to yield a new geomagnetic baseline. Unlike the existing baselines, our baseline is insensitive to geomagnetic storms. It is thus suitable for defining geomagnetic indices that accurately reflect the intensity of solar-driven perturbations. Our methodology is quick to implement and scalable, making it suitable for real-time operation. Strategies for operational forecasting of our geomagnetic baseline 1 day and 27 days in advance are presented.</description>

      <title>CTARR: A fast and robust method for identifying anatomical regions on CT images via atlas registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical image analysis tasks often focus on regions or structures located in a particular location within the patient's body. Often large parts of the image may not be of interest for the image analysis task. When using deep-learning based approaches, this causes an unnecessary increases the computational burden during inference and raises the chance of errors. In this paper, we introduce CTARR, a novel generic method for CT Anatomical Region Recognition. The method serves as a pre-processing step for any deep learning-based CT image analysis pipeline by automatically identifying the pre-defined anatomical region that is relevant for the follow-up task and removing the rest. It can be used in (i) image segmentation to prevent false positives in anatomically implausible regions and speeding up the inference, (ii) image classification to produce image crops that are consistent in their anatomical context, and (iii) image registration by serving as a fast pre-registration step. Our proposed method is based on atlas registration and provides a fast and robust way to crop any anatomical region encoded as one or multiple bounding box(es) from any unlabeled CT scan of the brain, chest, abdomen and/or pelvis. We demonstrate the utility and robustness of the proposed method in the context of medical image segmentation by evaluating it on six datasets of public segmentation challenges. The foreground voxels in the regions of interest are preserved in the vast majority of cases and tasks (97.45-100%) while taking only fractions of a seconds to compute (0.1-0.21s) on a deep learning workstation and greatly reducing the segmentation runtime (2.0-12.7x).

      <title>QDGset: A Large Scale Grasping Dataset Generated with Quality-Diversity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI have led to significant results in robotic learning, but skills like grasping remain partially solved. Many recent works exploit synthetic grasping datasets to learn to grasp unknown objects. However, those datasets were generated using simple grasp sampling methods using priors. Recently, Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have been proven to make grasp sampling significantly more efficient. In this work, we extend QDG-6DoF, a QD framework for generating object-centric grasps, to scale up the production of synthetic grasping datasets. We propose a data augmentation method that combines the transformation of object meshes with transfer learning from previous grasping repertoires. The conducted experiments show that this approach reduces the number of required evaluations per discovered robust grasp by up to 20%. We used this approach to generate QDGset, a dataset of 6DoF grasp poses that contains about 3.5 and 4.5 times more grasps and objects, respectively, than the previous state-of-the-art. Our method allows anyone to easily generate data, eventually contributing to a large-scale collaborative dataset of synthetic grasps.</description>

      <title>Post-edits Are Preferences Too</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preference Optimization (PO) techniques are currently one of the state of the art techniques for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on pairwise preference feedback from human annotators. However, in machine translation, this sort of feedback can be difficult to solicit. Additionally, Kreutzer et al. (2018) have shown that, for machine translation, pairwise preferences are less reliable than other forms of human feedback, such as 5-point ratings.
  We examine post-edits to see if they can be a source of reliable human preferences by construction. In PO, a human annotator is shown sequences $s_1$ and $s_2$ and asked for a preference judgment, %$s_1 &gt; s_2$; while for post-editing, editors \emph{create} $s_1$ and know that it should be better than $s_2$. We attempt to use these implicit preferences for PO and show that it helps the model move towards post-edit-like hypotheses and away from machine translation-like hypotheses. Furthermore, we show that best results are obtained by pre-training the model with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on post-edits in order to promote post-edit-like hypotheses to the top output ranks.</description>

      <title>Listening to the Wise Few: Select-and-Copy Attention Heads for Multiple-Choice QA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A standard way to evaluate the abilities of LLM involves presenting a multiple-choice question and selecting the option with the highest logit as the model's predicted answer. However, such a format for evaluating LLMs has limitations, since even if the model knows the correct answer, it may struggle to select the corresponding letter simply due to difficulties in following this rigid format. To address this, we introduce new scores that better capture and reveal model's underlying knowledge: the Query-Key Score (QK-score), derived from the interaction between query and key representations in attention heads, and the Attention Score, based on attention weights. These scores are extracted from specific \textit{select-and-copy} heads, which show consistent performance across popular Multi-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) datasets. Based on these scores, our method improves knowledge extraction, yielding up to 16\% gain for LLaMA2-7B and up to 10\% for larger models on popular MCQA benchmarks. At the same time, the accuracy on a simple synthetic dataset, where the model explicitly knows the right answer, increases by almost 60\%, achieving nearly perfect accuracy, therefore demonstrating the method's efficiency in mitigating MCQA format limitations. To support our claims, we conduct experiments on models ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters in both zero- and few-shot setups.</description>

Abstract: This paper demonstrates that simple features available during the calibration of a brain-computer interface can be utilized for source data selection to improve the performance of the brain-computer interface for a new target user through transfer learning. To support this, a public motor imagery dataset is used for analysis, and a method called the Transfer Performance Predictor method is presented. The simple features are based on the covariance matrices of the data and the Riemannian distance between them. The Transfer Performance Predictor method outperforms other source data selection methods as it selects source data that gives a better transfer learning performance for the target users.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By selecting different filter functions, spectral algorithms can generate various regularization methods to solve statistical inverse problems within the learning-from-samples framework. This paper combines distributed spectral algorithms with Sobolev kernels to tackle the functional linear regression problem. The design and mathematical analysis of the algorithms require only that the functional covariates are observed at discrete sample points. Furthermore, the hypothesis function spaces of the algorithms are the Sobolev spaces generated by the Sobolev kernels, optimizing both approximation capability and flexibility. Through the establishment of regularity conditions for the target function and functional covariate, we derive matching upper and lower bounds for the convergence of the distributed spectral algorithms in the Sobolev norm. This demonstrates that the proposed regularity conditions are reasonable and that the convergence analysis under these conditions is tight, capturing the essential characteristics of functional linear regression. The analytical techniques and estimates developed in this paper also enhance existing results in the previous literature.</description>

      <title>MetaMetrics: Calibrating Metrics For Generation Tasks Using Human Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the quality of a performance evaluation metric is crucial for ensuring that model outputs align with human preferences. However, it remains unclear how well each metric captures the diverse aspects of these preferences, as metrics often excel in one particular area but not across all dimensions. To address this, it is essential to systematically calibrate metrics to specific aspects of human preference, catering to the unique characteristics of each aspect. We introduce MetaMetrics, a calibrated meta-metric designed to evaluate generation tasks across different modalities in a supervised manner. MetaMetrics optimizes the combination of existing metrics to enhance their alignment with human preferences. Our metric demonstrates flexibility and effectiveness in both language and vision downstream tasks, showing significant benefits across various multilingual and multi-domain scenarios. MetaMetrics aligns closely with human preferences and is highly extendable and easily integrable into any application. This makes MetaMetrics a powerful tool for improving the evaluation of generation tasks, ensuring that metrics are more representative of human judgment across diverse contexts.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Meets Options: Hierarchical Generative Skill Composition for Temporally-Extended Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe and successful deployment of robots requires not only the ability to generate complex plans but also the capacity to frequently replan and correct execution errors. This paper addresses the challenge of long-horizon trajectory planning under temporally extended objectives in a receding horizon manner. To this end, we propose DOPPLER, a data-driven hierarchical framework that generates and updates plans based on instruction specified by linear temporal logic (LTL). Our method decomposes temporal tasks into chain of options with hierarchical reinforcement learning from offline non-expert datasets. It leverages diffusion models to generate options with low-level actions. We devise a determinantal-guided posterior sampling technique during batch generation, which improves the speed and diversity of diffusion generated options, leading to more efficient querying. Experiments on robot navigation and manipulation tasks demonstrate that DOPPLER can generate sequences of trajectories that progressively satisfy the specified formulae for obstacle avoidance and sequential visitation.

      <title>Parameter Competition Balancing for Model Merging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While fine-tuning pretrained models has become common practice, these models often underperform outside their specific domains. Recently developed model merging techniques enable the direct integration of multiple models, each fine-tuned for distinct tasks, into a single model. This strategy promotes multitasking capabilities without requiring retraining on the original datasets. However, existing methods fall short in addressing potential conflicts and complex correlations between tasks, especially in parameter-level adjustments, posing a challenge in effectively balancing parameter competition across various tasks. This paper introduces an innovative technique named PCB-Merging (Parameter Competition Balancing), a lightweight and training-free technique that adjusts the coefficients of each parameter for effective model merging. PCB-Merging employs intra-balancing to gauge parameter significance within individual tasks and inter-balancing to assess parameter similarities across different tasks. Parameters with low importance scores are dropped, and the remaining ones are rescaled to form the final merged model. We assessed our approach in diverse merging scenarios, including cross-task, cross-domain, and cross-training configurations, as well as out-of-domain generalization. The experimental results reveal that our approach achieves substantial performance enhancements across multiple modalities, domains, model sizes, number of tasks, fine-tuning forms, and large language models, outperforming existing model merging methods.

      <title>MenakBERT -- Hebrew Diacriticizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diacritical marks in the Hebrew language give words their vocalized form. The task of adding diacritical marks to plain Hebrew text is still dominated by a system that relies heavily on human-curated resources. Recent models trained on diacritized Hebrew texts still present a gap in performance. We use a recently developed char-based PLM to narrowly bridge this gap. Presenting MenakBERT, a character level transformer pretrained on Hebrew text and fine-tuned to produce diacritical marks for Hebrew sentences. We continue to show how finetuning a model for diacritizing transfers to a task such as part of speech tagging.</description>

      <title>PnP-Flow: Plug-and-Play Image Restoration with Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Plug-and-Play (PnP) Flow Matching, an algorithm for solving imaging inverse problems. PnP methods leverage the strength of pre-trained denoisers, often deep neural networks, by integrating them in optimization schemes. While they achieve state-of-the-art performance on various inverse problems in imaging, PnP approaches face inherent limitations on more generative tasks like inpainting. On the other hand, generative models such as Flow Matching pushed the boundary in image sampling yet lack a clear method for efficient use in image restoration. We propose to combine the PnP framework with Flow Matching (FM) by defining a time-dependent denoiser using a pre-trained FM model. Our algorithm alternates between gradient descent steps on the data-fidelity term, reprojections onto the learned FM path, and denoising. Notably, our method is computationally efficient and memory-friendly, as it avoids backpropagation through ODEs and trace computations. We evaluate its performance on denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting tasks, demonstrating superior results compared to existing PnP algorithms and Flow Matching based state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>LLM-Pilot: Characterize and Optimize Performance of your LLM Inference Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly growing in popularity, LLM inference services must be able to serve requests from thousands of users while satisfying performance requirements. The performance of an LLM inference service is largely determined by the hardware onto which it is deployed, but understanding of which hardware will deliver on performance requirements remains challenging. In this work we present LLM-Pilot - a first-of-its-kind system for characterizing and predicting performance of LLM inference services. LLM-Pilot performs benchmarking of LLM inference services, under a realistic workload, across a variety of GPUs, and optimizes the service configuration for each considered GPU to maximize performance. Finally, using this characterization data, LLM-Pilot learns a predictive model, which can be used to recommend the most cost-effective hardware for a previously unseen LLM. Compared to existing methods, LLM-Pilot can deliver on performance requirements 33% more frequently, whilst reducing costs by 60% on average.</description>

      <title>Predictive Attractor Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential memory, the ability to form and accurately recall a sequence of events or stimuli in the correct order, is a fundamental prerequisite for biological and artificial intelligence as it underpins numerous cognitive functions (e.g., language comprehension, planning, episodic memory formation, etc.) However, existing methods of sequential memory suffer from catastrophic forgetting, limited capacity, slow iterative learning procedures, low-order Markov memory, and, most importantly, the inability to represent and generate multiple valid future possibilities stemming from the same context. Inspired by biologically plausible neuroscience theories of cognition, we propose \textit{Predictive Attractor Models (PAM)}, a novel sequence memory architecture with desirable generative properties. PAM is a streaming model that learns a sequence in an online, continuous manner by observing each input \textit{only once}. Additionally, we find that PAM avoids catastrophic forgetting by uniquely representing past context through lateral inhibition in cortical minicolumns, which prevents new memories from overwriting previously learned knowledge. PAM generates future predictions by sampling from a union set of predicted possibilities; this generative ability is realized through an attractor model trained alongside the predictor. We show that PAM is trained with local computations through Hebbian plasticity rules in a biologically plausible framework. Other desirable traits (e.g., noise tolerance, CPU-based learning, capacity scaling) are discussed throughout the paper. Our findings suggest that PAM represents a significant step forward in the pursuit of biologically plausible and computationally efficient sequential memory models, with broad implications for cognitive science and artificial intelligence research.</description>

      <title>Better Call SAUL: Fluent and Consistent Language Model Editing with Generation Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To ensure large language models contain up-to-date knowledge, they need to be updated regularly. However, model editing is challenging as it might also affect knowledge that is unrelated to the new data. State-of-the-art methods identify parameters associated with specific knowledge and then modify them via direct weight updates. However, these locate-and-edit methods suffer from heavy computational overhead and lack theoretical validation. In contrast, directly fine-tuning the model on requested edits affects the model's behavior on unrelated knowledge, and significantly damages the model's generation fluency and consistency. To address these challenges, we propose SAUL, a streamlined model editing method that uses sentence concatenation with augmented random facts for generation regularization. Evaluations on three model editing benchmarks show that SAUL is a practical and reliable solution for model editing outperforming state-of-the-art methods while maintaining generation quality and reducing computational overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinnova, a collaborative initiative involving France, Germany, Switzerland, and Luxembourg, is dedicated to unlocking the power of precision medicine through data federation, standardization, and interoperability. This European Greater Region initiative seeks to create an interoperable European standard using artificial intelligence (AI) and data science to enhance healthcare outcomes and efficiency. Key components include multidisciplinary research centers, a federated biobanking strategy, a digital health innovation platform, and a federated AI strategy. It targets inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid diseases, and multiple sclerosis (MS), emphasizing data quality to develop AI algorithms for personalized treatment and translational research.
  The IHU Strasbourg (Institute of Minimal-invasive Surgery) has the lead in this initiative to develop the federated learning (FL) proof of concept (POC) that will serve as a foundation for advancing AI in healthcare. At its core, Clinnova-MS aims to enhance MS patient care by using FL to develop more accurate models that detect disease progression, guide interventions, and validate digital biomarkers across multiple sites. This technical report presents insights and key takeaways from the first cross-border federated POC on MS segmentation of MRI images within the Clinnova framework. While our work marks a significant milestone in advancing MS segmentation through cross-border collaboration, it also underscores the importance of addressing technical, logistical, and ethical considerations to realize the full potential of FL in healthcare settings.</description>

      <title>Quantifying User Coherence: A Unified Framework for Cross-Domain Recommendation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of Recommender Systems (RS) is closely tied to the quality and distinctiveness of user profiles, yet despite many advancements in raw performance, the sensitivity of RS to user profile quality remains under-researched. This paper introduces novel information-theoretic measures for understanding recommender systems: a "surprise" measure quantifying users' deviations from popular choices, and a "conditional surprise" measure capturing user interaction coherence. We evaluate 7 recommendation algorithms across 9 datasets, revealing the relationships between our measures and standard performance metrics. Using a rigorous statistical framework, our analysis quantifies how much user profile density and information measures impact algorithm performance across domains. By segmenting users based on these measures, we achieve improved performance with reduced data and show that simpler algorithms can match complex ones for low-coherence users. Additionally, we employ our measures to analyze how well different recommendation algorithms maintain the coherence and diversity of user preferences in their predictions, providing insights into algorithm behavior. This work advances the theoretical understanding of user behavior and practical heuristics for personalized recommendation systems, promoting more efficient and adaptive architectures.</description>

      <title>Efficient Residual Learning with Mixture-of-Experts for Universal Dexterous Grasping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal dexterous grasping across diverse objects presents a fundamental yet formidable challenge in robot learning. Existing approaches using reinforcement learning (RL) to develop policies on extensive object datasets face critical limitations, including complex curriculum design for multi-task learning and limited generalization to unseen objects. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ResDex, a novel approach that integrates residual policy learning with a mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework. ResDex is distinguished by its use of geometry-unaware base policies that are efficiently acquired on individual objects and capable of generalizing across a wide range of unseen objects. Our MoE framework incorporates several base policies to facilitate diverse grasping styles suitable for various objects. By learning residual actions alongside weights that combine these base policies, ResDex enables efficient multi-task RL for universal dexterous grasping. ResDex achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DexGraspNet dataset comprising 3,200 objects with an 88.8% success rate. It exhibits no generalization gap with unseen objects and demonstrates superior training efficiency, mastering all tasks within only 12 hours on a single GPU.</description>

      <title>Learning Diverse Bimanual Dexterous Manipulation Skills from Human Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bimanual dexterous manipulation is a critical yet underexplored area in robotics. Its high-dimensional action space and inherent task complexity present significant challenges for policy learning, and the limited task diversity in existing benchmarks hinders general-purpose skill development. Existing approaches largely depend on reinforcement learning, often constrained by intricately designed reward functions tailored to a narrow set of tasks. In this work, we present a novel approach for efficiently learning diverse bimanual dexterous skills from abundant human demonstrations. Specifically, we introduce BiDexHD, a framework that unifies task construction from existing bimanual datasets and employs teacher-student policy learning to address all tasks. The teacher learns state-based policies using a general two-stage reward function across tasks with shared behaviors, while the student distills the learned multi-task policies into a vision-based policy. With BiDexHD, scalable learning of numerous bimanual dexterous skills from auto-constructed tasks becomes feasible, offering promising advances toward universal bimanual dexterous manipulation. Our empirical evaluation on the TACO dataset, spanning 141 tasks across six categories, demonstrates a task fulfillment rate of 74.59% on trained tasks and 51.07% on unseen tasks, showcasing the effectiveness and competitive zero-shot generalization capabilities of BiDexHD.

      <title>Temporal Predictive Coding for Gradient Compression in Distributed Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a prediction-based gradient compression method for distributed learning with event-triggered communication. Our goal is to reduce the amount of information transmitted from the distributed agents to the parameter server by exploiting temporal correlation in the local gradients. We use a linear predictor that \textit{combines past gradients to form a prediction of the current gradient}, with coefficients that are optimized by solving a least-square problem. In each iteration, every agent transmits the predictor coefficients to the server such that the predicted local gradient can be computed. The difference between the true local gradient and the predicted one, termed the \textit{prediction residual, is only transmitted when its norm is above some threshold.} When this additional communication step is omitted, the server uses the prediction as the estimated gradient. This proposed design shows notable performance gains compared to existing methods in the literature, achieving convergence with reduced communication costs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dexterous hands exhibit significant potential for complex real-world grasping tasks. While recent studies have primarily focused on learning policies for specific robotic hands, the development of a universal policy that controls diverse dexterous hands remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study the learning of cross-embodiment dexterous grasping policies using reinforcement learning (RL). Inspired by the capability of human hands to control various dexterous hands through teleoperation, we propose a universal action space based on the human hand's eigengrasps. The policy outputs eigengrasp actions that are then converted into specific joint actions for each robot hand through a retargeting mapping. We simplify the robot hand's proprioception to include only the positions of fingertips and the palm, offering a unified observation space across different robot hands. Our approach demonstrates an 80% success rate in grasping objects from the YCB dataset across four distinct embodiments using a single vision-based policy. Additionally, our policy exhibits zero-shot generalization to two previously unseen embodiments and significant improvement in efficient finetuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer personalized responses based on user interactions, but this use case raises serious privacy concerns. Homomorphic encryption (HE) is a cryptographic protocol supporting arithmetic computations in encrypted states and provides a potential solution for privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML). However, the computational intensity of transformers poses challenges for applying HE to LLMs. In this work, we propose a modified HE-friendly transformer architecture with an emphasis on inference following personalized (private) fine-tuning. Utilizing LoRA fine-tuning and Gaussian kernels, we achieve significant computational speedups -- 6.94x for fine-tuning and 2.3x for inference -- while maintaining performance comparable to plaintext models. Our findings provide a viable proof of concept for offering privacy-preserving LLM services in areas where data protection is crucial.</description>

      <title>Dual Active Learning for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is critical to recent advances in generative artificial intelligence. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is widely applied to achieve this objective. A key step in RLHF is to learn the reward function from human feedback. However, human feedback is costly and time-consuming, making it essential to collect high-quality conversation data for human teachers to label. Additionally, different human teachers have different levels of expertise. It is thus critical to query the most appropriate teacher for their opinions. In this paper, we use offline reinforcement learning (RL) to formulate the alignment problem. Motivated by the idea of $D$-optimal design, we first propose a dual active reward learning algorithm for the simultaneous selection of conversations and teachers. Next, we apply pessimistic RL to solve the alignment problem, based on the learned reward estimator. Theoretically, we show that the reward estimator obtained through our proposed adaptive selection strategy achieves minimal generalized variance asymptotically, and prove that the sub-optimality of our pessimistic policy scales as $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ with a given sample budget $T$. Through simulations and experiments on LLMs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm and its superiority over state-of-the-arts.</description>

      <title>Cut the Crap: An Economical Communication Pipeline for LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language model (LLM)-powered agents have shown that collective intelligence can significantly outperform individual capabilities, largely attributed to the meticulously designed inter-agent communication topologies. Though impressive in performance, existing multi-agent pipelines inherently introduce substantial token overhead, as well as increased economic costs, which pose challenges for their large-scale deployments. In response to this challenge, we propose an economical, simple, and robust multi-agent communication framework, termed $\texttt{AgentPrune}$, which can seamlessly integrate into mainstream multi-agent systems and prunes redundant or even malicious communication messages. Technically, $\texttt{AgentPrune}$ is the first to identify and formally define the \textit{communication redundancy} issue present in current LLM-based multi-agent pipelines, and efficiently performs one-shot pruning on the spatial-temporal message-passing graph, yielding a token-economic and high-performing communication topology. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that $\texttt{AgentPrune}$ \textbf{(I)} achieves comparable results as state-of-the-art topologies at merely $\$5.6$ cost compared to their $\$43.7$, \textbf{(II)} integrates seamlessly into existing multi-agent frameworks with $28.1\%\sim72.8\%\downarrow$ token reduction, and \textbf{(III)} successfully defend against two types of agent-based adversarial attacks with $3.5\%\sim10.8\%\uparrow$ performance boost.</description>

      <title>Learning Emergence of Interaction Patterns across Independent RL Agents in Multi-Agent Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world problems, such as controlling swarms of drones and urban traffic, naturally lend themselves to modeling as multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) problems. However, existing multi-agent RL methods often suffer from scalability challenges, primarily due to the introduction of communication among agents. Consequently, a key challenge lies in adapting the success of deep learning in single-agent RL to the multi-agent setting. In response to this challenge, we propose an approach that fundamentally reimagines multi-agent environments. Unlike conventional methods that model each agent individually with separate networks, our approach, the Bottom Up Network (BUN), adopts a unique perspective. BUN treats the collective of multi-agents as a unified entity while employing a specialized weight initialization strategy that promotes independent learning. Furthermore, we dynamically establish connections among agents using gradient information, enabling coordination when necessary while maintaining these connections as limited and sparse to effectively manage the computational budget. Our extensive empirical evaluations across a variety of cooperative multi-agent scenarios, including tasks such as cooperative navigation and traffic control, consistently demonstrate BUN's superiority over baseline methods with substantially reduced computational costs.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models are Evolutionary Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a convergence of machine learning and biology, we reveal that diffusion models are evolutionary algorithms. By considering evolution as a denoising process and reversed evolution as diffusion, we mathematically demonstrate that diffusion models inherently perform evolutionary algorithms, naturally encompassing selection, mutation, and reproductive isolation. Building on this equivalence, we propose the Diffusion Evolution method: an evolutionary algorithm utilizing iterative denoising -- as originally introduced in the context of diffusion models -- to heuristically refine solutions in parameter spaces. Unlike traditional approaches, Diffusion Evolution efficiently identifies multiple optimal solutions and outperforms prominent mainstream evolutionary algorithms. Furthermore, leveraging advanced concepts from diffusion models, namely latent space diffusion and accelerated sampling, we introduce Latent Space Diffusion Evolution, which finds solutions for evolutionary tasks in high-dimensional complex parameter space while significantly reducing computational steps. This parallel between diffusion and evolution not only bridges two different fields but also opens new avenues for mutual enhancement, raising questions about open-ended evolution and potentially utilizing non-Gaussian or discrete diffusion models in the context of Diffusion Evolution.</description>

      <title>Local Flow Matching Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) is a simulation-free method for learning a continuous and invertible flow to interpolate between two distributions, and in particular to generate data from noise in generative modeling. In this paper, we introduce Local Flow Matching (LFM), which learns a sequence of FM sub-models and each matches a diffusion process up to the time of the step size in the data-to-noise direction. In each step, the two distributions to be interpolated by the sub-model are closer to each other than data vs. noise, and this enables the use of smaller models with faster training. The stepwise structure of LFM is natural to be distilled and different distillation techniques can be adopted to speed up generation. Theoretically, we prove a generation guarantee of the proposed flow model in terms of the $\chi^2$-divergence between the generated and true data distributions. In experiments, we demonstrate the improved training efficiency and competitive generative performance of LFM compared to FM on the unconditional generation of tabular data and image datasets, and also on the conditional generation of robotic manipulation policies.</description>

      <title>Obtaining Lower Query Complexities through Lightweight Zeroth-Order Proximal Gradient Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization is one key technique for machine learning problems where gradient calculation is expensive or impossible. Several variance reduced ZO proximal algorithms have been proposed to speed up ZO optimization for non-smooth problems, and all of them opted for the coordinated ZO estimator against the random ZO estimator when approximating the true gradient, since the former is more accurate. While the random ZO estimator introduces bigger error and makes convergence analysis more challenging compared to coordinated ZO estimator, it requires only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ computation, which is significantly less than $\mathcal{O}(d)$ computation of the coordinated ZO estimator, with $d$ being dimension of the problem space. To take advantage of the computationally efficient nature of the random ZO estimator, we first propose a ZO objective decrease (ZOOD) property which can incorporate two different types of errors in the upper bound of convergence rate. Next, we propose two generic reduction frameworks for ZO optimization which can automatically derive the convergence results for convex and non-convex problems respectively, as long as the convergence rate for the inner solver satisfies the ZOOD property. With the application of two reduction frameworks on our proposed ZOR-ProxSVRG and ZOR-ProxSAGA, two variance reduced ZO proximal algorithms with fully random ZO estimators, we improve the state-of-the-art function query complexities from $\mathcal{O}\left(\min\{\frac{dn^{1/2}}{\epsilon^2}, \frac{d}{\epsilon^3}\}\right)$ to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{n+d}{\epsilon^2}\right)$ under $d &gt; n^{\frac{1}{2}}$ for non-convex problems, and from $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{d}{\epsilon^2}\right)$ to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(n\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}+\frac{d}{\epsilon}\right)$ for convex problems.</description>

      <title>The Benefit of Being Bayesian in Online Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the framework of Conformal Prediction (CP), we study the online construction of valid confidence sets given a black-box machine learning model. By converting the target confidence levels into quantile levels, the problem can be reduced to predicting the quantiles (in hindsight) of a sequentially revealed data sequence. Two very different approaches have been studied previously. (i) Direct approach: Assuming the data sequence is iid or exchangeable, one could maintain the empirical distribution of the observed data as an algorithmic belief, and directly predict its quantiles. (ii) Indirect approach: As statistical assumptions often do not hold in practice, a recent trend is to consider the adversarial setting and apply first-order online optimization to moving quantile losses (Gibbs &amp; Cand\`es, 2021). It requires knowing the target quantile level beforehand, and suffers from certain validity issues on the obtained confidence sets, due to the associated loss linearization.
  This paper presents a novel Bayesian CP framework that combines their strengths. Without any statistical assumption, it is able to both: (i) answer multiple arbitrary confidence level queries online, with provably low regret; and (ii) overcome the validity issues suffered by first-order optimization baselines, due to being "data-centric" rather than "iterate-centric".
  From a technical perspective, our key idea is to regularize the algorithmic belief of the above direct approach by a Bayesian prior, which "robustifies" it by simulating a non-linearized Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) algorithm on the output. For statisticians, this can be regarded as an online adversarial view of Bayesian inference. Importantly, the proposed belief update backbone is shared by prediction heads targeting different confidence levels, bringing practical benefits analogous to U-calibration (Kleinberg et al., 2023).</description>

      <title>Generalization emerges from local optimization in a self-organized learning network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design and analyze a new paradigm for building supervised learning networks, driven only by local optimization rules without relying on a global error function. Traditional neural networks with a fixed topology are made up of identical nodes and derive their expressiveness from an appropriate adjustment of connection weights. In contrast, our network stores new knowledge in the nodes accurately and instantaneously, in the form of a lookup table. Only then is some of this information structured and incorporated into the network geometry. The training error is initially zero by construction and remains so throughout the network topology transformation phase. The latter involves a small number of local topological transformations, such as splitting or merging of nodes and adding binary connections between them. The choice of operations to be carried out is only driven by optimization of expressivity at the local scale. What we are primarily looking for in a learning network is its ability to generalize, i.e. its capacity to correctly answer questions for which it has never learned the answers. We show on numerous examples of classification tasks that the networks generated by our algorithm systematically reach such a state of perfect generalization when the number of learned examples becomes sufficiently large. We report on the dynamics of the change of state and show that it is abrupt and has the distinctive characteristics of a first order phase transition, a phenomenon already observed for traditional learning networks and known as grokking. In addition to proposing a non-potential approach for the construction of learning networks, our algorithm makes it possible to rethink the grokking transition in a new light, under which acquisition of training data and topological structuring of data are completely decoupled phenomena.</description>

      <title>IC3M: In-Car Multimodal Multi-object Monitoring for Abnormal Status of Both Driver and Passengers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, in-car monitoring has emerged as a promising technology for detecting early-stage abnormal status of the driver and providing timely alerts to prevent traffic accidents. Although training models with multimodal data enhances the reliability of abnormal status detection, the scarcity of labeled data and the imbalance of class distribution impede the extraction of critical abnormal state features, significantly deteriorating training performance. Furthermore, missing modalities due to environment and hardware limitations further exacerbate the challenge of abnormal status identification. More importantly, monitoring abnormal health conditions of passengers, particularly in elderly care, is of paramount importance but remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we introduce our IC3M, an efficient camera-rotation-based multimodal framework for monitoring both driver and passengers in a car. Our IC3M comprises two key modules: an adaptive threshold pseudo-labeling strategy and a missing modality reconstruction. The former customizes pseudo-labeling thresholds for different classes based on the class distribution, generating class-balanced pseudo labels to guide model training effectively, while the latter leverages crossmodality relationships learned from limited labels to accurately recover missing modalities by distribution transferring from available modalities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IC3M outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in accuracy, precision, and recall while exhibiting superior robustness under limited labeled data and severe missing modality.</description>

      <title>Agents' Room: Narrative Generation through Multi-step Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Writing compelling fiction is a multifaceted process combining elements such as crafting a plot, developing interesting characters, and using evocative language. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for story writing, they currently rely heavily on intricate prompting, which limits their use. We propose Agents' Room, a generation framework inspired by narrative theory, that decomposes narrative writing into subtasks tackled by specialized agents. To illustrate our method, we introduce Tell Me A Story, a high-quality dataset of complex writing prompts and human-written stories, and a novel evaluation framework designed specifically for assessing long narratives. We show that Agents' Room generates stories that are preferred by expert evaluators over those produced by baseline systems by leveraging collaboration and specialization to decompose the complex story writing task into tractable components. We provide extensive analysis with automated and human-based metrics of the generated output.</description>

      <title>Long-Sequence Recommendation Models Need Decoupled Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lifelong user behavior sequences, comprising up to tens of thousands of history behaviors, are crucial for capturing user interests and predicting user responses in modern recommendation systems. A two-stage paradigm is typically adopted to handle these long sequences: a few relevant behaviors are first searched from the original long sequences via an attention mechanism in the first stage and then aggregated with the target item to construct a discriminative representation for prediction in the second stage. In this work, we identify and characterize, for the first time, a neglected deficiency in existing long-sequence recommendation models: a single set of embeddings struggles with learning both attention and representation, leading to interference between these two processes. Initial attempts to address this issue using linear projections -- a technique borrowed from language processing -- proved ineffective, shedding light on the unique challenges of recommendation models. To overcome this, we propose the Decoupled Attention and Representation Embeddings (DARE) model, where two distinct embedding tables are initialized and learned separately to fully decouple attention and representation. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that DARE provides more accurate search of correlated behaviors and outperforms baselines with AUC gains up to 0.9% on public datasets and notable online system improvements. Furthermore, decoupling embedding spaces allows us to reduce the attention embedding dimension and accelerate the search procedure by 50% without significant performance impact, enabling more efficient, high-performance online serving.</description>

      <title>IndicSentEval: How Effectively do Multilingual Transformer Models encode Linguistic Properties for Indic Languages?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing. To understand why they perform so well and to assess their reliability, several studies have focused on questions such as: Which linguistic properties are encoded by these models, and to what extent? How robust are these models in encoding linguistic properties when faced with perturbations in the input text? However, these studies have mainly focused on BERT and the English language. In this paper, we investigate similar questions regarding encoding capability and robustness for 8 linguistic properties across 13 different perturbations in 6 Indic languages, using 9 multilingual Transformer models (7 universal and 2 Indic-specific). To conduct this study, we introduce a novel multilingual benchmark dataset, IndicSentEval, containing approximately $\sim$47K sentences. Surprisingly, our probing analysis of surface, syntactic, and semantic properties reveals that while almost all multilingual models demonstrate consistent encoding performance for English, they show mixed results for Indic languages. As expected, Indic-specific multilingual models capture linguistic properties in Indic languages better than universal models. Intriguingly, universal models broadly exhibit better robustness compared to Indic-specific models, particularly under perturbations such as dropping both nouns and verbs, dropping only verbs, or keeping only nouns. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into probing and perturbation-specific strengths and weaknesses of popular multilingual Transformer-based models for different Indic languages. We make our code and dataset publicly available [https://tinyurl.com/IndicSentEval}].</description>

Abstract: Predictive business process analytics has become important for organizations, offering real-time operational support for their processes. However, these algorithms often perform unfair predictions because they are based on biased variables (e.g., gender or nationality), namely variables embodying discrimination. This paper addresses the challenge of integrating a debiasing phase into predictive business process analytics to ensure that predictions are not influenced by biased variables. Our framework leverages on adversial debiasing is evaluated on four case studies, showing a significant reduction in the contribution of biased variables to the predicted value. The proposed technique is also compared with the state of the art in fairness in process mining, illustrating that our framework allows for a more enhanced level of fairness, while retaining a better prediction quality.</description>

      <title>Online Learning Guided Quasi-Newton Methods with Global Non-Asymptotic Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a quasi-Newton method for solving smooth and monotone nonlinear equations, including unconstrained minimization and minimax optimization as special cases. For the strongly monotone setting, we establish two global convergence bounds: (i) a linear convergence rate that matches the rate of the celebrated extragradient method, and (ii) an explicit global superlinear convergence rate that provably surpasses the linear convergence rate after at most ${O}(d)$ iterations, where $d$ is the problem's dimension. In addition, for the case where the operator is only monotone, we prove a global convergence rate of ${O}(\min\{{1}/{k},{\sqrt{d}}/{k^{1.25}}\})$ in terms of the duality gap. This matches the rate of the extragradient method when $k = {O}(d^2)$ and is faster when $k = \Omega(d^2)$. These results are the first global convergence results to demonstrate a provable advantage of a quasi-Newton method over the extragradient method, without querying the Jacobian of the operator. Unlike classical quasi-Newton methods, we achieve this by using the hybrid proximal extragradient framework and a novel online learning approach for updating the Jacobian approximation matrices. Specifically, guided by the convergence analysis, we formulate the Jacobian approximation update as an online convex optimization problem over non-symmetric matrices, relating the regret of the online problem to the convergence rate of our method. To facilitate efficient implementation, we further develop a tailored online learning algorithm based on an approximate separation oracle, which preserves structures such as symmetry and sparsity in the Jacobian matrices.</description>

      <title>Estimating Generalization Performance Along the Trajectory of Proximal SGD in Robust Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the generalization performance of iterates obtained by Gradient Descent (GD), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and their proximal variants in high-dimensional robust regression problems. The number of features is comparable to the sample size and errors may be heavy-tailed. We introduce estimators that precisely track the generalization error of the iterates along the trajectory of the iterative algorithm. These estimators are provably consistent under suitable conditions. The results are illustrated through several examples, including Huber regression, pseudo-Huber regression, and their penalized variants with non-smooth regularizer. We provide explicit generalization error estimates for iterates generated from GD and SGD, or from proximal SGD in the presence of a non-smooth regularizer. The proposed risk estimates serve as effective proxies for the actual generalization error, allowing us to determine the optimal stopping iteration that minimizes the generalization error. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed generalization error estimates.</description>

      <title>How to Train Long-Context Language Models (Effectively)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study continued training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of a language model (LM) to make effective use of long-context information. We first establish a reliable evaluation protocol to guide model development -- Instead of perplexity or simple needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) tests, we use a broad set of long-context tasks, and we evaluate models after SFT with instruction data as this better reveals long-context abilities. Supported by our robust evaluations, we run thorough experiments to decide the data mix for continued pre-training, the instruction tuning dataset, and many other design choices. We find that (1) code repositories and books are excellent sources of long data, but it is crucial to combine them with high-quality short data; (2) training with a sequence length beyond the evaluation length boosts long-context performance; (3) for SFT, using only short instruction datasets yields strong performance on long-context tasks. Our final model, ProLong-8B, which is initialized from Llama-3 and trained on 40B tokens, demonstrates state-of-the-art long-context performance among similarly sized models at a length of 128K. ProLong outperforms Llama-3.18B-Instruct on the majority of long-context tasks despite having seen only 5% as many tokens during long-context training. Additionally, ProLong can effectively process up to 512K tokens, one of the longest context windows of publicly available LMs.</description>

      <title>CulturalBench: a Robust, Diverse and Challenging Benchmark on Measuring the (Lack of) Cultural Knowledge of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To make large language models (LLMs) more helpful across diverse cultures, it is essential to have effective cultural knowledge benchmarks to measure and track our progress. Effective benchmarks need to be robust, diverse, and challenging. We introduce CulturalBench: a set of 1,227 human-written and human-verified questions for effectively assessing LLMs' cultural knowledge, covering 45 global regions including the underrepresented ones like Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, and Peru. Questions - each verified by five independent annotators - span 17 diverse topics ranging from food preferences to greeting etiquettes. We evaluate models on two setups: CulturalBench-Easy and CulturalBench-Hard which share the same questions but asked differently. We find that LLMs are sensitive to such difference in setups (e.g., GPT-4o with 27.3% difference). Compared to human performance (92.6% accuracy), CulturalBench-Hard is more challenging for frontier LLMs with the best performing model (GPT-4o) at only 61.5% and the worst (Llama3-8b) at 21.4%. Moreover, we find that LLMs often struggle with tricky questions that have multiple correct answers (e.g., What utensils do the Chinese usually use?), revealing a tendency to converge to a single answer. Our results also indicate that OpenAI GPT-4o substantially outperform other proprietary and open source models in questions related to all but one region (Oceania). Nonetheless, all models consistently underperform on questions related to South America and the Middle East.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose the Highly Adaptive Ridge (HAR): a regression method that achieves a $n^{-1/3}$ dimension-free L2 convergence rate in the class of right-continuous functions with square-integrable sectional derivatives. This is a large nonparametric function class that is particularly appropriate for tabular data. HAR is exactly kernel ridge regression with a specific data-adaptive kernel based on a saturated zero-order tensor-product spline basis expansion. We use simulation and real data to confirm our theory. We demonstrate empirical performance better than state-of-the-art algorithms for small datasets in particular.</description>

      <title>DailyDilemmas: Revealing Value Preferences of LLMs with Quandaries of Daily Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As we increasingly seek guidance from LLMs for decision-making in daily life, many of these decisions are not clear-cut and depend significantly on the personal values and ethical standards of the users. We present DailyDilemmas, a dataset of 1,360 moral dilemmas encountered in everyday life. Each dilemma includes two possible actions and with each action, the affected parties and human values invoked. Based on these dilemmas, we consolidated a set of human values across everyday topics e.g., interpersonal relationships, workplace, and environmental issues. We evaluated LLMs on these dilemmas to determine what action they will take and the values represented by these actions. Then, we analyzed these values through the lens of five popular theories inspired by sociology, psychology and philosophy. These theories are: World Value Survey, Moral Foundation Theory, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, Aristotle's Virtues, and Plutchik Wheel of Emotion. We find that LLMs are most aligned with the self-expression over survival values in terms of World Value Survey, care over loyalty in Moral Foundation Theory. Interestingly, we find large preferences differences in models for some core values such as truthfulness e.g., Mixtral-8x7B model tends to neglect it by 9.7% while GPT-4-turbo model tends to select it by 9.4%. We also study the recent guidance released by OpenAI (ModelSpec), and Anthropic (Constitutional AI) to understand how their released principles reflect their actual value prioritization when facing nuanced moral reasoning in daily-life settings. We find that end users cannot effectively steer such prioritization using system prompts.</description>

      <title>Discovering Clues of Spoofed LM Watermarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM watermarks stand out as a promising way to attribute ownership of LLM-generated text. One threat to watermark credibility comes from spoofing attacks, where an unauthorized third party forges the watermark, enabling it to falsely attribute arbitrary texts to a particular LLM. While recent works have demonstrated that state-of-the-art schemes are in fact vulnerable to spoofing, they lack deeper qualitative analysis of the texts produced by spoofing methods. In this work, we for the first time reveal that there are observable differences between genuine and spoofed watermark texts. Namely, we show that regardless of their underlying approach, all current spoofing methods consistently leave observable artifacts in spoofed texts, indicative of watermark forgery. We build upon these findings to propose rigorous statistical tests that reliably reveal the presence of such artifacts, effectively discovering that a watermark was spoofed. Our experimental evaluation shows high test power across all current spoofing methods, providing insights into their fundamental limitations, and suggesting a way to mitigate this threat.</description>

      <title>Selective Attention Improves Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unneeded elements in the attention's context degrade performance. We introduce Selective Attention, a simple parameter-free change to the standard attention mechanism which reduces attention to unneeded elements. Selective attention improves language modeling performance in a variety of model sizes and context lengths. For example, a range of transformers trained with the language modeling objective on C4 with selective attention perform equivalently to standard transformers with ~2X more heads and parameters in their attention modules. Selective attention also allows decreasing the size of the attention's context buffer, leading to meaningful reductions in the memory and compute requirements during inference. For example, transformers with 100M parameters trained on C4 with context sizes of 512, 1,024, and 2,048 need 16X, 25X, and 47X less memory for their attention module, respectively, when equipped with selective attention, as those without selective attention, with the same validation perplexity.</description>

      <title>AlzhiNet: Traversing from 2DCNN to 3DCNN, Towards Early Detection and Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with increasing prevalence among the aging population, necessitating early and accurate diagnosis for effective disease management. In this study, we present a novel hybrid deep learning framework that integrates both 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (2D-CNN) and 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-CNN), along with a custom loss function and volumetric data augmentation, to enhance feature extraction and improve classification performance in AD diagnosis. According to extensive experiments, AlzhiNet outperforms standalone 2D and 3D models, highlighting the importance of combining these complementary representations of data. The depth and quality of 3D volumes derived from the augmented 2D slices also significantly influence the model's performance. The results indicate that carefully selecting weighting factors in hybrid predictions is imperative for achieving optimal results. Our framework has been validated on the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) from Kaggle and MIRIAD datasets, obtaining accuracies of 98.9% and 99.99%, respectively, with an AUC of 100%. Furthermore, AlzhiNet was studied under a variety of perturbation scenarios on the Alzheimer's Kaggle dataset, including Gaussian noise, brightness, contrast, salt and pepper noise, color jitter, and occlusion. The results obtained show that AlzhiNet is more robust to perturbations than ResNet-18, making it an excellent choice for real-world applications. This approach represents a promising advancement in the early diagnosis and treatment planning for Alzheimer's disease.</description>

      <title>Measurements with Noise: Bayesian Optimization for Co-optimizing Noise and Property Discovery in Automated Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a Bayesian optimization (BO) workflow that integrates intra-step noise optimization into automated experimental cycles. Traditional BO approaches in automated experiments focus on optimizing experimental trajectories but often overlook the impact of measurement noise on data quality and cost. Our proposed framework simultaneously optimizes both the target property and the associated measurement noise by introducing time as an additional input parameter, thereby balancing the signal-to-noise ratio and experimental duration. Two approaches are explored: a reward-driven noise optimization and a double-optimization acquisition function, both enhancing the efficiency of automated workflows by considering noise and cost within the optimization process. We validate our method through simulations and real-world experiments using Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM), demonstrating the successful optimization of measurement duration and property exploration. Our approach offers a scalable solution for optimizing multiple variables in automated experimental workflows, improving data quality, and reducing resource expenditure in materials science and beyond.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have proven to be remarkably efficient, both across a wide range of natural language processing tasks and well beyond them. However, a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the origins of their impressive performance remains elusive. In this paper, we approach this challenging task by drawing an equivalence between generic autoregressive language models with vocabulary of size $T$ and context window of size $K$ and Markov chains defined on a finite state space of size $\mathcal{O}(T^K)$. We derive several surprising findings related to the existence of a stationary distribution of Markov chains that capture the inference power of LLMs, their speed of convergence to it, and the influence of the temperature on the latter. We then prove pre-training and in-context generalization bounds and show how the drawn equivalence allows us to enrich their interpretation. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical guarantees with experiments on several recent LLMs to highlight how they capture the behavior observed in practice.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Inference-Time Compute: LLMs Can Predict if They Can Do Better, Even Mid-Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inference-time computation is a powerful paradigm to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs), with Best-of-N sampling being a widely used technique. However, this method is computationally expensive, requiring both (1) an external reward model and (2) the generation of multiple samples. In this work, we introduce a new generative self-evaluation scheme designed to adaptively reduce the number of generated samples while maintaining or even improving performance. We use a generative reward model formulation, allowing the LLM to predict mid-generation the probability that restarting the generation will yield a better response. These predictions are obtained without an external reward model and can be used to decide whether or not to generate more samples, prune unpromising samples early on, or to pick the best sample. This capability is very inexpensive as it involves generating a single predefined token. Trained using a dataset constructed with real unfiltered LMSYS user prompts, Llama 3.1 8B's win rate against GPT-4 on AlpacaEval increases from 21% to 34% with 16 samples and math performance on GSM8K improves from 84% to 91%. By sampling only when the LLM determines that it is beneficial to do so and adaptively adjusting temperature annealing, we demonstrate that 74% of the improvement from using 16 samples can be achieved with only 1.2 samples on average. We further demonstrate that 50-75% of samples can be pruned early in generation with minimal degradation in performance. Overall, our methods enable more efficient and scalable compute utilization during inference for LLMs.</description>

      <title>Revisit Large-Scale Image-Caption Data in Pre-training Multimodal Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal models highlight the value of rewritten captions for improving performance, yet key challenges remain. For example, while synthetic captions often provide superior quality and image-text alignment, it is not clear whether they can fully replace AltTexts: the role of synthetic captions and their interaction with original web-crawled AltTexts in pre-training is still not well understood. Moreover, different multimodal foundation models may have unique preferences for specific caption formats, but efforts to identify the optimal captions for each model remain limited. In this work, we propose a novel, controllable, and scalable captioning pipeline designed to generate diverse caption formats tailored to various multimodal models. By examining Short Synthetic Captions (SSC) towards Dense Synthetic Captions (DSC+) as case studies, we systematically explore their effects and interactions with AltTexts across models such as CLIP, multimodal LLMs, and diffusion models. Our findings reveal that a hybrid approach that keeps both synthetic captions and AltTexts can outperform the use of synthetic captions alone, improving both alignment and performance, with each model demonstrating preferences for particular caption formats. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into optimizing captioning strategies, thereby advancing the pre-training of multimodal foundation models.</description>

      <title>Salient Information Prompting to Steer Content in Prompt-based Abstractive Summarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent summaries across domains using prompting techniques, reducing the need to train models for summarization applications. However, crafting effective prompts that guide LLMs to generate summaries with the appropriate level of detail and writing style remains a challenge. In this paper, we explore the use of salient information extracted from the source document to enhance summarization prompts. We show that adding keyphrases in prompts can improve ROUGE F1 and recall, making the generated summaries more similar to the reference and more complete. The number of keyphrases can control the precision-recall trade-off. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that incorporating phrase-level salient information is superior to word- or sentence-level. However, the impact on hallucination is not universally positive across LLMs. To conduct this analysis, we introduce Keyphrase Signal Extractor (SigExt), a lightweight model that can be finetuned to extract salient keyphrases. By using SigExt, we achieve consistent ROUGE improvements across datasets and open-weight and proprietary LLMs without any LLM customization. Our findings provide insights into leveraging salient information in building prompt-based summarization systems.</description>

      <title>Grounding Large Language Models In Embodied Environment With Imperfect World Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite a widespread success in various applications, large language models (LLMs) often stumble when tackling basic physical reasoning or executing robotics tasks, due to a lack of direct experience with the physical nuances of the real world. To address these issues, we propose a Grounding Large language model with Imperfect world MOdel (GLIMO), which utilizes proxy world models such as simulators to collect and synthesize trining data. GLIMO incorporates an LLM agent-based data generator to automatically create high-quality and diverse instruction datasets. The generator includes an iterative self-refining module for temporally consistent experience sampling, a diverse set of question-answering instruction seeds, and a retrieval-augmented generation module for reflecting on prior experiences. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach improve the performance of strong open-source LLMs like LLaMA-3 with a performance boost of 2.04 $\times$, 1.54 $\times$, and 1.82 $\times$ across three different benchmarks, respectively. The performance is able to compete with or surpass their larger counterparts such as GPT-4.</description>

      <title>Neutral residues: revisiting adapters for model extension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of extending a pretrained large language model to a new domain that was not seen at training time, like adding a language for which the original model has seen no or little training data. Popular solutions like fine-tuning or low-rank adaptation are successful at domain adaptation, but formally they do not add any extra capacity and degrade the performance in the original domain.
  Our paper analyzes this extension problem under three angles: data, architecture and training procedure, which are advantageously considered jointly. In particular, we improve adapters and make it possible to learn an entire new language while ensuring that the output of the neural network is almost unchanged in the original domain. For this purpose, we modify the new residual blocks in a way that leads each new residual block to output near-zeros in the original domain.
  This solution of neutral residues, which borrows architectural components from mixture of experts, is effective: with only 20% extra learnable weights compared to an original model trained on English, we get results that are significantly better than concurrent approaches (fine-tuning, low-rank or vanilla adapters) in terms of the trade-off between learning a new language and not forgetting English.</description>

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has been a celebrated method for training vision encoders to generate image/text representations facilitating various applications. Recently, CLIP has been widely adopted as the vision backbone of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to connect image inputs for language interactions. The success of CLIP as a vision-language foundation model relies on aligning web-crawled noisy text annotations at image levels. Nevertheless, such criteria may become insufficient for downstream tasks in need of fine-grained vision representations, especially when region-level understanding is demanding for MLLMs. In this paper, we improve the localization capability of CLIP with several advances. We propose a pre-training method called Contrastive Localized Language-Image Pre-training (CLOC) by complementing CLIP with region-text contrastive loss and modules. We formulate a new concept, promptable embeddings, of which the encoder produces image embeddings easy to transform into region representations given spatial hints. To support large-scale pre-training, we design a visually-enriched and spatially-localized captioning framework to effectively generate region-text pseudo-labels at scale. By scaling up to billions of annotated images, CLOC enables high-quality regional embeddings for image region recognition and retrieval tasks, and can be a drop-in replacement of CLIP to enhance MLLMs, especially on referring and grounding tasks.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent summaries across domains using prompting techniques, reducing the need to train models for summarization applications. However, crafting effective prompts that guide LLMs to generate summaries with the appropriate level of detail and writing style remains a challenge. In this paper, we explore the use of salient information extracted from the source document to enhance summarization prompts. We show that adding keyphrases in prompts can improve ROUGE F1 and recall, making the generated summaries more similar to the reference and more complete. The number of keyphrases can control the precision-recall trade-off. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that incorporating phrase-level salient information is superior to word- or sentence-level. However, the impact on hallucination is not universally positive across LLMs. To conduct this analysis, we introduce Keyphrase Signal Extractor (CriSPO), a lightweight model that can be finetuned to extract salient keyphrases. By using CriSPO, we achieve consistent ROUGE improvements across datasets and open-weight and proprietary LLMs without any LLM customization. Our findings provide insights into leveraging salient information in building prompt-based summarization systems.</description>

      <title>SIEVE: General Purpose Data Filtering System Matching GPT-4o Accuracy at 1% the Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating specialized large language models requires vast amounts of clean, special purpose data for training and fine-tuning. With only a handful of existing large-scale, domain-specific datasets, creation of new datasets is required in most applications. This requires the development of new application-specific filtering of web-scale data. Filtering with a high-performance, general-purpose LLM such as GPT-4o can be highly effective, but this is extremely expensive at web-scale. This paper proposes SIEVE, a lightweight alternative that matches GPT-4o accuracy at a fraction of the cost. SIEVE can perform up to 500 filtering operations for the cost of one GPT-4o filtering call. The key to SIEVE is a seamless integration of GPT-4o and lightweight T5 models, using active learning to fine-tune T5 in the background with a small number of calls to GPT-4o. Once trained, it performs as well as GPT-4o at a tiny fraction of the cost. We experimentally validate SIEVE on the OpenWebText dataset, using five highly customized filter tasks targeting high quality and domain-specific content. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in curating large, high-quality datasets for language model training at a substantially lower cost (1%) than existing techniques. To further validate SIEVE, experiments show that SIEVE and GPT-4o achieve similar accuracy, with human evaluators preferring SIEVE's filtering results to those of GPT-4o.</description>

      <title>Erasing Conceptual Knowledge from Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concept erasure in language models has traditionally lacked a comprehensive evaluation framework, leading to incomplete assessments of effectiveness of erasure methods. We propose an evaluation paradigm centered on three critical criteria: innocence (complete knowledge removal), seamlessness (maintaining conditional fluent generation), and specificity (preserving unrelated task performance). Our evaluation metrics naturally motivate the development of Erasure of Language Memory (ELM), a new method designed to address all three dimensions. ELM employs targeted low-rank updates to alter output distributions for erased concepts while preserving overall model capabilities including fluency when prompted for an erased concept. We demonstrate ELM's efficacy on biosecurity, cybersecurity, and literary domain erasure tasks. Comparative analysis shows that ELM achieves superior performance across our proposed metrics, including near-random scores on erased topic assessments, generation fluency, maintained accuracy on unrelated benchmarks, and robustness under adversarial attacks. Our code, data, and trained models are available at https://elm.baulab.info</description>

      <title>Interpreting and Editing Vision-Language Representations to Mitigate Hallucinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the internal representations of vision-language models (VLMs) to address hallucinations, a persistent challenge despite advances in model size and training. We project VLMs' internal image representations to their language vocabulary and observe more confident output probabilities on real objects than hallucinated objects. We additionally use these output probabilities to spatially localize real objects. Building on this approach, we introduce a knowledge erasure algorithm that removes hallucinations by linearly orthogonalizing image features with respect to hallucinated object features. We show that targeted edits to a model's latent representations can reduce hallucinations by up to 25.7% on the COCO2014 dataset while preserving performance. Our findings demonstrate how a deeper understanding of VLMs' latent representations can enhance reliability and enable novel capabilities, such as zero-shot segmentation.</description>

      <title>Vinoground: Scrutinizing LMMs over Dense Temporal Reasoning with Short Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been growing sentiment recently that modern large multimodal models (LMMs) have addressed most of the key challenges related to short video comprehension. As a result, both academia and industry are gradually shifting their attention towards the more complex challenges posed by understanding long-form videos. However, is this really the case? Our studies indicate that LMMs still lack many fundamental reasoning capabilities even when dealing with short videos. We introduce Vinoground, a temporal counterfactual LMM evaluation benchmark encompassing 1000 short and natural video-caption pairs. We demonstrate that existing LMMs severely struggle to distinguish temporal differences between different actions and object transformations. For example, the best model GPT-4o only obtains ~50% on our text and video scores, showing a large gap compared to the human baseline of ~90%. All open-source multimodal models and CLIP-based models perform much worse, producing mostly random chance performance. Through this work, we shed light onto the fact that temporal reasoning in short videos is a problem yet to be fully solved. The dataset and evaluation code are available at https://vinoground.github.io.</description>

      <title>Flash-Splat: 3D Reflection Removal with Flash Cues and Gaussian Splats</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple yet effective approach for separating transmitted and reflected light. Our key insight is that the powerful novel view synthesis capabilities provided by modern inverse rendering methods (e.g.,~3D Gaussian splatting) allow one to perform flash/no-flash reflection separation using unpaired measurements -- this relaxation dramatically simplifies image acquisition over conventional paired flash/no-flash reflection separation methods. Through extensive real-world experiments, we demonstrate our method, Flash-Splat, accurately reconstructs both transmitted and reflected scenes in 3D. Our method outperforms existing 3D reflection separation methods, which do not leverage illumination control, by a large margin.

      <title>Representations learnt by SGD and Adaptive learning rules: Conditions that vary sparsity and selectivity in neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.11653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the point of view of the human brain, continual learning can perform various tasks without mutual interference. An effective way to reduce mutual interference can be found in sparsity and selectivity of neurons. According to Aljundi et al. and Hadsell et al., imposing sparsity at the representational level is advantageous for continual learning because sparse neuronal activations encourage less overlap between parameters, resulting in less interference. Similarly, highly selective neural networks are likely to induce less interference since particular response in neurons will reduce the chance of overlap with other parameters. Considering that the human brain performs continual learning over the lifespan, finding conditions where sparsity and selectivity naturally arises may provide insight for understanding how the brain functions. This paper investigates various conditions that naturally increase sparsity and selectivity in a neural network. This paper tested different optimizers with Hoyer's sparsity metric and CCMAS selectivity metric in MNIST classification task. It is essential to note that investigations on the natural occurrence of sparsity and selectivity concerning various conditions have not been acknowledged in any sector of neuroscience nor machine learning until this day. This paper found that particular conditions increase sparsity and selectivity such as applying a large learning rate and lowering a batch size. In addition to the relationship between the condition, sparsity, and selectivity, the following will be discussed based on empirical analysis: 1. The relationship between sparsity and selectivity and 2. The relationship between test accuracy, sparsity, and selectivity.</description>

      <title>Learning Fair Models without Sensitive Attributes: A Generative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.16413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most existing fair classifiers rely on sensitive attributes to achieve fairness. However, for many scenarios, we cannot obtain sensitive attributes due to privacy and legal issues. The lack of sensitive attributes challenges many existing fair classifiers. Though we lack sensitive attributes, for many applications, there usually exists features or information of various formats that are relevant to sensitive attributes. For example, purchase history of a person can reflect his or her race, which would help for learning fair classifiers on race. However, the work on exploring relevant features for learning fair models without sensitive attributes is rather limited. Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of learning fair models without sensitive attributes by exploring relevant features. We propose a probabilistic generative framework to effectively estimate the sensitive attribute from the training data with relevant features in various formats and utilize the estimated sensitive attribute information to learn fair models. Experimental results on real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our framework in terms of both accuracy and fairness.</description>

      <title>Adjusted Expected Improvement for Cumulative Regret Minimization in Noisy Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.04901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The expected improvement (EI) is one of the most popular acquisition functions for Bayesian optimization (BO) and has demonstrated good empirical performances in many applications for the minimization of simple regret. However, under the evaluation metric of cumulative regret, the performance of EI may not be competitive, and its existing theoretical regret upper bound still has room for improvement. To adapt the EI for better performance under cumulative regret, we introduce a novel quantity called the evaluation cost which is compared against the acquisition function, and with this, develop the expected improvement-cost (EIC) algorithm. In each iteration of EIC, a new point with the largest acquisition function value is sampled, only if that value exceeds its evaluation cost. If none meets this criteria, the current best point is resampled. This evaluation cost quantifies the potential downside of sampling a point, which is important under the cumulative regret metric as the objective function value in every iteration affects the performance measure. We establish in theory a high-probability regret upper bound of EIC based on the maximum information gain, which is tighter than the bound of existing EI-based algorithms. It is also comparable to the regret bound of other popular BO algorithms such as Thompson sampling (GP-TS) and upper confidence bound (GP-UCB). We further perform experiments to illustrate the improvement of EIC over several popular BO algorithms.</description>

      <title>On the Statistical Efficiency of Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning with General Function Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11283v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the fundamental statistical efficiency of Reinforcement Learning in Mean-Field Control (MFC) and Mean-Field Game (MFG) with general model-based function approximation. We introduce a new concept called Mean-Field Model-Based Eluder Dimension (MF-MBED), which characterizes the inherent complexity of mean-field model classes. We show that a rich family of Mean-Field RL problems exhibits low MF-MBED. Additionally, we propose algorithms based on maximal likelihood estimation, which can return an $\epsilon$-optimal policy for MFC or an $\epsilon$-Nash Equilibrium policy for MFG. The overall sample complexity depends only polynomially on MF-MBED, which is potentially much lower than the size of state-action space. Compared with previous works, our results only require the minimal assumptions including realizability and Lipschitz continuity.</description>

      <title>Towards Mitigating Spurious Correlations in the Wild: A Benchmark and a more Realistic Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks often exploit non-predictive features that are spuriously correlated with class labels, leading to poor performance on groups of examples without such features. Despite the growing body of recent works on remedying spurious correlations, the lack of a standardized benchmark hinders reproducible evaluation and comparison of the proposed solutions. To address this, we present SpuCo, a python package with modular implementations of state-of-the-art solutions enabling easy and reproducible evaluation of current methods. Using SpuCo, we demonstrate the limitations of existing datasets and evaluation schemes in validating the learning of predictive features over spurious ones. To overcome these limitations, we propose two new vision datasets: (1) SpuCoMNIST, a synthetic dataset that enables simulating the effect of real world data properties e.g. difficulty of learning spurious feature, as well as noise in the labels and features; (2) SpuCoAnimals, a large-scale dataset curated from ImageNet that captures spurious correlations in the wild much more closely than existing datasets. These contributions highlight the shortcomings of current methods and provide a direction for future research in tackling spurious correlations. SpuCo, containing the benchmark and datasets, can be found at https://github.com/BigML-CS-UCLA/SpuCo, with detailed documentation available at https://spuco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.</description>

      <title>Optimal Learners for Realizable Regression: PAC Learning and Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to characterize the statistical complexity of realizable regression both in the PAC learning setting and the online learning setting. Previous work had established the sufficiency of finiteness of the fat shattering dimension for PAC learnability and the necessity of finiteness of the scaled Natarajan dimension, but little progress had been made towards a more complete characterization since the work of Simon (SICOMP '97). To this end, we first introduce a minimax instance optimal learner for realizable regression and propose a novel dimension that both qualitatively and quantitatively characterizes which classes of real-valued predictors are learnable. We then identify a combinatorial dimension related to the Graph dimension that characterizes ERM learnability in the realizable setting. Finally, we establish a necessary condition for learnability based on a combinatorial dimension related to the DS dimension, and conjecture that it may also be sufficient in this context. Additionally, in the context of online learning we provide a dimension that characterizes the minimax instance optimal cumulative loss up to a constant factor and design an optimal online learner for realizable regression, thus resolving an open question raised by Daskalakis and Golowich in STOC '22.</description>

      <title>Streaming Compression of Scientific Data via weak-SINDy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper a streaming weak-SINDy algorithm is developed specifically for compressing streaming scientific data. The production of scientific data, either via simulation or experiments, is undergoing an stage of exponential growth, which makes data compression important and often necessary for storing and utilizing large scientific data sets. As opposed to classical "offline" compression algorithms that perform compression on a readily available data set, streaming compression algorithms compress data "online" while the data generated from simulation or experiments is still flowing through the system. This feature makes streaming compression algorithms well-suited for scientific data compression, where storing the full data set offline is often infeasible. This work proposes a new streaming compression algorithm, streaming weak-SINDy, which takes advantage of the underlying data characteristics during compression. The streaming weak-SINDy algorithm constructs feature matrices and target vectors in the online stage via a streaming integration method in a memory efficient manner. The feature matrices and target vectors are then used in the offline stage to build a model through a regression process that aims to recover equations that govern the evolution of the data. For compressing high-dimensional streaming data, we adopt a streaming proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) process to reduce the data dimension and then use the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm to compress the temporal data of the POD expansion. We propose modifications to the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm to accommodate the dynamically updated POD basis. By combining the built model from the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm and a small amount of data samples, the full data flow could be reconstructed accurately at a low memory cost, as shown in the numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Regret-Optimal Federated Transfer Learning for Kernel Regression with Applications in American Option Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an optimal iterative scheme for federated transfer learning, where a central planner has access to datasets ${\cal D}_1,\dots,{\cal D}_N$ for the same learning model $f_{\theta}$. Our objective is to minimize the cumulative deviation of the generated parameters $\{\theta_i(t)\}_{t=0}^T$ across all $T$ iterations from the specialized parameters $\theta^\star_{1},\ldots,\theta^\star_N$ obtained for each dataset, while respecting the loss function for the model $f_{\theta(T)}$ produced by the algorithm upon halting. We only allow for continual communication between each of the specialized models (nodes/agents) and the central planner (server), at each iteration (round). For the case where the model $f_{\theta}$ is a finite-rank kernel regression, we derive explicit updates for the regret-optimal algorithm. By leveraging symmetries within the regret-optimal algorithm, we further develop a nearly regret-optimal heuristic that runs with $\mathcal{O}(Np^2)$ fewer elementary operations, where $p$ is the dimension of the parameter space. Additionally, we investigate the adversarial robustness of the regret-optimal algorithm showing that an adversary which perturbs $q$ training pairs by at-most $\varepsilon&gt;0$, across all training sets, cannot reduce the regret-optimal algorithm's regret by more than $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon q \bar{N}^{1/2})$, where $\bar{N}$ is the aggregate number of training pairs. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct numerical experiments in the context of American option pricing, utilizing a randomly generated finite-rank kernel.</description>

      <title>AtomSurf : Surface Representation for Learning on Protein Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16519v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While there has been significant progress in evaluating and comparing different representations for learning on protein data, the role of surface-based learning approaches remains not well-understood. In particular, there is a lack of direct and fair benchmark comparison between the best available surface-based learning methods against alternative representations such as graphs. Moreover, the few existing surface-based approaches either use surface information in isolation or, at best, perform global pooling between surface and graph-based architectures.
  In this work, we fill this gap by first adapting a state-of-the-art surface encoder for protein learning tasks. We then perform a direct and fair comparison of the resulting method against alternative approaches within the Atom3D benchmark, highlighting the limitations of pure surface-based learning. Finally, we propose an integrated approach, which allows learned feature sharing between graphs and surface representations on the level of nodes and vertices $\textit{across all layers}$.
  We demonstrate that the resulting architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on all tasks in the Atom3D benchmark, while adhering to the strict benchmark protocol, as well as more broadly on binding site identification and binding pocket classification. Furthermore, we use coarsened surfaces and optimize our approach for efficiency, making our tool competitive in training and inference time with existing techniques.

      <title>Sum-of-Parts: Faithful Attributions for Groups of Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature attributions explain machine learning predictions by assigning importance scores to input features. While faithful attributions accurately reflect feature contributions to the model's prediction, unfaithful ones can lead to misleading interpretations, making them unreliable in high-stake domains. The challenge of unfaithfulness of post-hoc attributions led to the development of self-explaining models. However, self-explaining models often trade-off performance for interpretability. In this work, we develop Sum-of-Parts (SOP), a new framework that transforms any differentiable model into a self-explaining model whose predictions can be attributed to groups of features. The SOP framework leverages pretrained deep learning models with custom attention modules to learn useful feature groups end-to-end without direct supervision. With these capabilities, SOP achieves highest performance while also scoring high with respect to faithfulness metrics on both ImageNet and CosmoGrid. We validate the usefulness of the groups learned by SOP through their high purity, strong human distinction ability, and practical utility in scientific discovery. In a case study, we show how SOP assists cosmologists in uncovering new insights about galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Scalable Label Distribution Learning for Multi-Label Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) refers to the problem of tagging a given instance with a set of relevant labels. Most existing MLC methods are based on the assumption that the correlation of two labels in each label pair is symmetric, which is violated in many real-world scenarios. Moreover, most existing methods design learning processes associated with the number of labels, which makes their computational complexity a bottleneck when scaling up to large-scale output space. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel method named Scalable Label Distribution Learning (SLDL) for multi-label classification which can describe different labels as distributions in a latent space, where the label correlation is asymmetric and the dimension is independent of the number of labels. Specifically, SLDL first converts labels into continuous distributions within a low-dimensional latent space and leverages the asymmetric metric to establish the correlation between different labels. Then, it learns the mapping from the feature space to the latent space, resulting in the computational complexity is no longer related to the number of labels. Finally, SLDL leverages a nearest-neighbor-based strategy to decode the latent representations and obtain the final predictions. Extensive experiments illustrate that SLDL achieves very competitive classification performances with little computational consumption.</description>

      <title>Fair Sampling in Diffusion Models through Switching Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03140v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown their effectiveness in generation tasks by well-approximating the underlying probability distribution. However, diffusion models are known to suffer from an amplified inherent bias from the training data in terms of fairness. While the sampling process of diffusion models can be controlled by conditional guidance, previous works have attempted to find empirical guidance to achieve quantitative fairness. To address this limitation, we propose a fairness-aware sampling method called \textit{attribute switching} mechanism for diffusion models. Without additional training, the proposed sampling can obfuscate sensitive attributes in generated data without relying on classifiers. We mathematically prove and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two key aspects: (i) the generation of fair data and (ii) the preservation of the utility of the generated data.</description>

      <title>GLOCALFAIR: Jointly Improving Global and Local Group Fairness in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prospective solution for collaboratively learning a shared model across clients without sacrificing their data privacy. However, the federated learned model tends to be biased against certain demographic groups (e.g., racial and gender groups) due to the inherent FL properties, such as data heterogeneity and party selection. Unlike centralized learning, mitigating bias in FL is particularly challenging as private training datasets and their sensitive attributes are typically not directly accessible. Most prior research in this field only focuses on global fairness while overlooking the local fairness of individual clients. Moreover, existing methods often require sensitive information about the client's local datasets to be shared, which is not desirable. To address these issues, we propose GLOCALFAIR, a client-server co-design fairness framework that can jointly improve global and local group fairness in FL without the need for sensitive statistics about the client's private datasets. Specifically, we utilize constrained optimization to enforce local fairness on the client side and adopt a fairness-aware clustering-based aggregation on the server to further ensure the global model fairness across different sensitive groups while maintaining high utility. Experiments on two image datasets and one tabular dataset with various state-of-the-art fairness baselines show that GLOCALFAIR can achieve enhanced fairness under both global and local data distributions while maintaining a good level of utility and client fairness.</description>

      <title>Can Active Label Correction Improve LLM-based Modular AI Systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modular AI systems can be developed using LLM-prompts-based modules to minimize deployment time even for complex tasks. However, these systems do not always perform well and improving them using the data traces collected from a deployment remains an open challenge. The data traces contain LLM inputs and outputs, but the annotations from LLMs are noisy. We hypothesize that Active Label Correction (ALC) can be use on the collected data to train smaller task-specific improved models that can replace LLM-based modules. In this paper, we study the noise in three GPT-3.5-annotated datasets and their denoising with human feedback. We also propose a novel method ALC3 that iteratively applies three updates to the training dataset: auto-correction, correction using human feedback and filtering. Our results show that ALC3 can lead to oracle performance with feedback on 17-24% fewer examples than the number of noisy examples in the dataset across three different NLP tasks.</description>

      <title>Graph Diffusion Transformers for Multi-Conditional Molecular Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inverse molecular design with diffusion models holds great potential for advancements in material and drug discovery. Despite success in unconditional molecular generation, integrating multiple properties such as synthetic score and gas permeability as condition constraints into diffusion models remains unexplored. We present the Graph Diffusion Transformer (Graph DiT) for multi-conditional molecular generation. Graph DiT integrates an encoder to learn numerical and categorical property representations with the Transformer-based denoiser. Unlike previous graph diffusion models that add noise separately on the atoms and bonds in the forward diffusion process, Graph DiT is trained with a novel graph-dependent noise model for accurate estimation of graph-related noise in molecules. We extensively validate Graph DiT for multi-conditional polymer and small molecule generation. Results demonstrate the superiority of Graph DiT across nine metrics from distribution learning to condition control for molecular properties. A polymer inverse design task for gas separation with feedback from domain experts further demonstrates its practical utility.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Offline Reinforcement Learning with State-only Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Batch offline data have been shown considerably beneficial for reinforcement learning. Their benefit is further amplified by upsampling with generative models. In this paper, we consider a novel opportunity where interaction with environment is feasible, but only restricted to observations, i.e., \textit{no reward} feedback is available. This setting is broadly applicable, as simulators or even real cyber-physical systems are often accessible, while in contrast reward is often difficult or expensive to obtain. As a result, the learner must make good sense of the offline data to synthesize an efficient scheme of querying the transition of state. Our method first leverages online interactions to generate high-return trajectories via conditional diffusion models. They are then blended with the original offline trajectories through a stitching algorithm, and the resulting augmented data can be applied generically to downstream reinforcement learners. Superior empirical performance is demonstrated over state-of-the-art data augmentation methods that are extended to utilize state-only interactions.</description>

      <title>Risk-Sensitive Diffusion: Robustly Optimizing Diffusion Models with Noisy Samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models are mainly studied on image data. However, non-image data (e.g., tabular data) are also prevalent in real applications and tend to be noisy due to some inevitable factors in the stage of data collection, degrading the generation quality of diffusion models. In this paper, we consider a novel problem setting where every collected sample is paired with a vector indicating the data quality: risk vector. This setting applies to many scenarios involving noisy data and we propose risk-sensitive SDE, a type of stochastic differential equation (SDE) parameterized by the risk vector, to address it. With some proper coefficients, risk-sensitive SDE can minimize the negative effect of noisy samples on the optimization of diffusion models. We conduct systematic studies for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise distributions, providing analytical forms of risk-sensitive SDE. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on multiple tabular and time-series datasets, showing that risk-sensitive SDE permits a robust optimization of diffusion models with noisy samples and significantly outperforms previous baselines.</description>

      <title>Deep Exploration with PAC-Bayes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning for continuous control under sparse rewards is an under-explored problem despite its significance in real life. Many complex skills build on intermediate ones as prerequisites. For instance, a humanoid locomotor has to learn how to stand before it can learn to walk. To cope with reward sparsity, a reinforcement learning agent has to perform deep exploration. However, existing deep exploration methods are designed for small discrete action spaces, and their successful generalization to state-of-the-art continuous control remains unproven. We address the deep exploration problem for the first time from a PAC-Bayesian perspective in the context of actor-critic learning. To do this, we quantify the error of the Bellman operator through a PAC-Bayes bound, where a bootstrapped ensemble of critic networks represents the posterior distribution, and their targets serve as a data-informed function-space prior. We derive an objective function from this bound and use it to train the critic ensemble. Each critic trains an individual actor network, implemented as a shared trunk and critic-specific heads. The agent performs deep exploration by acting deterministically on a randomly chosen actor head. Our proposed algorithm, named PAC-Bayesian Actor-Critic (PBAC), is the only algorithm to successfully discover sparse rewards on a diverse set of continuous control tasks with varying difficulty.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Linear Mode Connectivity via Permutation-Based Weight Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04051v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Ainsworth et al. showed that using weight matching (WM) to minimize the $L_2$ distance in a permutation search of model parameters effectively identifies permutations that satisfy linear mode connectivity (LMC), where the loss along a linear path between two independently trained models with different seeds remains nearly constant. This paper analyzes LMC using WM, which is useful for understanding stochastic gradient descent's effectiveness and its application in areas like model merging. We first empirically show that permutations found by WM do not significantly reduce the $L_2$ distance between two models, and the occurrence of LMC is not merely due to distance reduction by WM itself. We then demonstrate that permutations can change the directions of the singular vectors, but not the singular values, of the weight matrices in each layer. This finding shows that permutations found by WM primarily align the directions of singular vectors associated with large singular values across models. This alignment brings the singular vectors with large singular values, which determine the model's functionality, closer between the original and merged models, allowing the merged model to retain functionality similar to the original models, thereby satisfying LMC. This paper also analyzes activation matching (AM) in terms of singular vectors and finds that the principle of AM is the same as that of WM. Finally, we analyze the difference between WM and the straight-through estimator (STE), a dataset-dependent permutation search method, and show that WM can be more advantageous than STE in achieving LMC among three or more models.</description>

Abstract: We consider the infinite-horizon, average-reward restless bandit problem in discrete time. We propose a new class of policies that are designed to drive a progressively larger subset of arms toward the optimal distribution. We show that our policies are asymptotically optimal with an $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap for an $N$-armed problem, assuming only a unichain and aperiodicity assumption. Our approach departs from most existing work that focuses on index or priority policies, which rely on the Global Attractor Property (GAP) to guarantee convergence to the optimum, or a recently developed simulation-based policy, which requires a Synchronization Assumption (SA).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present "Graph Feature Preprocessor", a software library for detecting typical money laundering patterns in financial transaction graphs in real time. These patterns are used to produce a rich set of transaction features for downstream machine learning training and inference tasks such as detection of fraudulent financial transactions. We show that our enriched transaction features dramatically improve the prediction accuracy of gradient-boosting-based machine learning models. Our library exploits multicore parallelism, maintains a dynamic in-memory graph, and efficiently mines subgraph patterns in the incoming transaction stream, which enables it to be operated in a streaming manner. Our solution, which combines our Graph Feature Preprocessor and gradient-boosting-based machine learning models, can detect illicit transactions with higher minority-class F1 scores than standard graph neural networks in anti-money laundering and phishing datasets. In addition, the end-to-end throughput rate of our solution executed on a multicore CPU outperforms the graph neural network baselines executed on a powerful V100 GPU. Overall, the combination of high accuracy, a high throughput rate, and low latency of our solution demonstrates the practical value of our library in real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bandit convex optimization (BCO) is a general framework for online decision making under uncertainty. While tight regret bounds for general convex losses have been established, existing algorithms achieving these bounds have prohibitive computational costs for high dimensional data.
  In this paper, we propose a simple and practical BCO algorithm inspired by the online Newton step algorithm. We show that our algorithm achieves optimal (in terms of horizon) regret bounds for a large class of convex functions that we call $\kappa$-convex. This class contains a wide range of practically relevant loss functions including linear, quadratic, and generalized linear models. In addition to optimal regret, this method is the most efficient known algorithm for several well-studied applications including bandit logistic regression.
  Furthermore, we investigate the adaptation of our second-order bandit algorithm to online convex optimization with memory. We show that for loss functions with a certain affine structure, the extended algorithm attains optimal regret. This leads to an algorithm with optimal regret for bandit LQR/LQG problems under a fully adversarial noise model, thereby resolving an open question posed in \citep{gradu2020non} and \citep{sun2023optimal}.
  Finally, we show that the more general problem of BCO with (non-affine) memory is harder. We derive a $\tilde{\Omega}(T^{2/3})$ regret lower bound, even under the assumption of smooth and quadratic losses.</description>

      <title>Learning an Actionable Discrete Diffusion Policy via Large-Scale Actionless Video Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning a generalist embodied agent capable of completing multiple tasks poses challenges, primarily stemming from the scarcity of action-labeled robotic datasets. In contrast, a vast amount of human videos exist, capturing intricate tasks and interactions with the physical world. Promising prospects arise for utilizing actionless human videos for pre-training and transferring the knowledge to facilitate robot policy learning through limited robot demonstrations. However, it remains a challenge due to the domain gap between humans and robots. Moreover, it is difficult to extract useful information representing the dynamic world from human videos, because of its noisy and multimodal data structure. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework to tackle these challenges, which leverages a unified discrete diffusion to combine generative pre-training on human videos and policy fine-tuning on a small number of action-labeled robot videos. We start by compressing both human and robot videos into unified video tokens. In the pre-training stage, we employ a discrete diffusion model with a mask-and-replace diffusion strategy to predict future video tokens in the latent space. In the fine-tuning stage, we harness the imagined future videos to guide low-level action learning with a limited set of robot data. Experiments demonstrate that our method generates high-fidelity future videos for planning and enhances the fine-tuned policies compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches with superior performance.

      <title>On the Curses of Future and History in Future-dependent Value Functions for Off-policy Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study off-policy evaluation (OPE) in partially observable environments with complex observations, with the goal of developing estimators whose guarantee avoids exponential dependence on the horizon. While such estimators exist for MDPs and POMDPs can be converted to history-based MDPs, their estimation errors depend on the state-density ratio for MDPs which becomes history ratios after conversion, an exponential object. Recently, Uehara et al. [2022a] proposed future-dependent value functions as a promising framework to address this issue, where the guarantee for memoryless policies depends on the density ratio over the latent state space. However, it also depends on the boundedness of the future-dependent value function and other related quantities, which we show could be exponential-in-length and thus erasing the advantage of the method. In this paper, we discover novel coverage assumptions tailored to the structure of POMDPs, such as outcome coverage and belief coverage, which enable polynomial bounds on the aforementioned quantities. As a side product, our analyses also lead to the discovery of new algorithms with complementary properties.</description>

      <title>Collaborative learning of common latent representations in routinely collected multivariate ICU physiological signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Intensive Care Units (ICU), the abundance of multivariate time series presents an opportunity for machine learning (ML) to enhance patient phenotyping. In contrast to previous research focused on electronic health records (EHR), here we propose an ML approach for phenotyping using routinely collected physiological time series data. Our new algorithm integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with collaborative filtering concepts to identify common physiological states across patients. Tested on real-world ICU clinical data for intracranial hypertension (IH) detection in patients with brain injury, our method achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.889 and average precision (AP) of 0.725. Moreover, our algorithm outperforms autoencoders in learning more structured latent representations of the physiological signals. These findings highlight the promise of our methodology for patient phenotyping, leveraging routinely collected multivariate time series to improve clinical care practices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two hybrid quantum-inspired neural networks with residual and dense connections respectively for pattern recognition. We explain the concrete frameworks and illustrate the potential superiority to prevent gradient explosion of our hybrid models. A group of numerical experiments about generalization power shows that our hybrid models possess the same generalization power as the pure classical models with different noisy datasets utilized. More importantly, another group of numerical experiments of robustness demonstrates that our hybrid models outperform pure classical models notably in resistance to parameter attacks with various asymmetric noises. Also, an ablation study indicate that the recognition accuracy of our hybrid models is 2\%-3\% higher than that of the quantum neural network without residual or dense connection. Eventually, we discuss the application scenarios of our hybrid models by analyzing their computational complexities.</description>

      <title>Benign overfitting in leaky ReLU networks with moderate input dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of benign overfitting asks whether it is possible for a model to perfectly fit noisy training data and still generalize well. We study benign overfitting in two-layer leaky ReLU networks trained with the hinge loss on a binary classification task. We consider input data that can be decomposed into the sum of a common signal and a random noise component, that lie on subspaces orthogonal to one another. We characterize conditions on the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the model parameters giving rise to benign versus non-benign (or harmful) overfitting: in particular, if the SNR is high then benign overfitting occurs, conversely if the SNR is low then harmful overfitting occurs. We attribute both benign and non-benign overfitting to an approximate margin maximization property and show that leaky ReLU networks trained on hinge loss with gradient descent (GD) satisfy this property. In contrast to prior work we do not require the training data to be nearly orthogonal. Notably, for input dimension $d$ and training sample size $n$, while results in prior work require $d = \Omega(n^2 \log n)$, here we require only $d = \Omega\left(n\right)$.</description>

      <title>3M-Diffusion: Latent Multi-Modal Diffusion for Language-Guided Molecular Structure Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating molecular structures with desired properties is a critical task with broad applications in drug discovery and materials design. We propose 3M-Diffusion, a novel multi-modal molecular graph generation method, to generate diverse, ideally novel molecular structures with desired properties. 3M-Diffusion encodes molecular graphs into a graph latent space which it then aligns with the text space learned by encoder-based LLMs from textual descriptions. It then reconstructs the molecular structure and atomic attributes based on the given text descriptions using the molecule decoder. It then learns a probabilistic mapping from the text space to the latent molecular graph space using a diffusion model. The results of our extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that 3M-Diffusion can generate high-quality, novel and diverse molecular graphs that semantically match the textual description provided.</description>

      <title>The Model Openness Framework: Promoting Completeness and Openness for Reproducibility, Transparency, and Usability in Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13784v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI (GAI) offers numerous opportunities for research and innovation, but its commercialization has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Most open GAI models lack the necessary components for full understanding, auditing, and reproducibility, and some use restrictive licenses whilst claiming to be "open-source". To address these concerns, we introduce the Model Openness Framework (MOF), a ranked classification system that rates machine learning models based on their completeness and openness, following principles of open science, as well as the Model Openness Tool (MOT), which provides a reference implementation designed to evaluate ML models against the principles outlined by the MOF. The MOF requires specific components of the model development lifecycle to be included and released under appropriate open licenses. This framework aims to prevent misrepresentation of models claiming to be open, to guide researchers and developers in providing all model components under permissive licenses, and to help individuals and organizations identify models that can be safely adopted. By promoting transparency and reproducibility, the MOF combats open-washing and establishes completeness and openness as core tenets of responsible AI research and development. Widespread adoption of the MOF will foster a more open AI ecosystem, benefiting research, innovation, and the adoption of state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>DeNetDM: Debiasing by Network Depth Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When neural networks are trained on biased datasets, they tend to inadvertently learn spurious correlations, leading to challenges in achieving strong generalization and robustness. Current approaches to address such biases typically involve utilizing bias annotations, reweighting based on pseudo-bias labels, or enhancing diversity within bias-conflicting data points through augmentation techniques. We introduce DeNetDM, a novel debiasing method based on the observation that shallow neural networks prioritize learning core attributes, while deeper ones emphasize biases when tasked with acquiring distinct information. Using a training paradigm derived from Product of Experts, we create both biased and debiased branches with deep and shallow architectures and then distill knowledge to produce the target debiased model. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that our approach outperforms current debiasing techniques, achieving a notable improvement of around 5% in three datasets, encompassing both synthetic and real-world data. Remarkably, DeNetDM accomplishes this without requiring annotations pertaining to bias labels or bias types, while still delivering performance on par with supervised counterparts. Furthermore, our approach effectively harnesses the diversity of bias-conflicting points within the data, surpassing previous methods and obviating the need for explicit augmentation-based methods to enhance the diversity of such bias-conflicting points. The source code will be available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Federated Reinforcement Learning with Policy Gradient Updates: Algorithm Design and Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL), we propose a novel asynchronous federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework termed AFedPG, which constructs a global model through collaboration among $N$ agents using policy gradient (PG) updates. To address the challenge of lagged policies in asynchronous settings, we design a delay-adaptive lookahead technique \textit{specifically for FedRL} that can effectively handle heterogeneous arrival times of policy gradients. We analyze the theoretical global convergence bound of AFedPG, and characterize the advantage of the proposed algorithm in terms of both the sample complexity and time complexity. Specifically, our AFedPG method achieves $O(\frac{{\epsilon}^{-2.5}}{N})$ sample complexity for global convergence at each agent on average. Compared to the single agent setting with $O(\epsilon^{-2.5})$ sample complexity, it enjoys a linear speedup with respect to the number of agents. Moreover, compared to synchronous FedPG, AFedPG improves the time complexity from $O(\frac{t_{\max}}{N})$ to $O({\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{t_{i}}})^{-1}$, where $t_{i}$ denotes the time consumption in each iteration at agent $i$, and $t_{\max}$ is the largest one. The latter complexity $O({\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{t_{i}}})^{-1}$ is always smaller than the former one, and this improvement becomes significant in large-scale federated settings with heterogeneous computing powers ($t_{\max}\gg t_{\min}$). Finally, we empirically verify the improved performance of AFedPG in four widely-used MuJoCo environments with varying numbers of agents. We also demonstrate the advantages of AFedPG in various computing heterogeneity scenarios.</description>

      <title>AttackBench: Evaluating Gradient-based Attacks for Adversarial Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarial examples are typically optimized with gradient-based attacks. While novel attacks are continuously proposed, each is shown to outperform its predecessors using different experimental setups, hyperparameter settings, and number of forward and backward calls to the target models. This provides overly-optimistic and even biased evaluations that may unfairly favor one particular attack over the others. In this work, we aim to overcome these limitations by proposing AttackBench, i.e., the first evaluation framework that enables a fair comparison among different attacks. To this end, we first propose a categorization of gradient-based attacks, identifying their main components and differences. We then introduce our framework, which evaluates their effectiveness and efficiency. We measure these characteristics by (i) defining an optimality metric that quantifies how close an attack is to the optimal solution, and (ii) limiting the number of forward and backward queries to the model, such that all attacks are compared within a given maximum query budget. Our extensive experimental analysis compares more than $100$ attack implementations with a total of over $800$ different configurations against CIFAR-10 and ImageNet models, highlighting that only very few attacks outperform all the competing approaches. Within this analysis, we shed light on several implementation issues that prevent many attacks from finding better solutions or running at all. We release AttackBench as a publicly-available benchmark, aiming to continuously update it to include and evaluate novel gradient-based attacks for optimizing adversarial examples.</description>

      <title>Functional Latent Dynamics for Irregularly Sampled Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Irregularly sampled time series with missing values are often observed in multiple real-world applications such as healthcare, climate and astronomy. They pose a significant challenge to standard deep learning models that operate only on fully observed and regularly sampled time series. In order to capture the continuous dynamics of the irregular time series, many models rely on solving an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the hidden state. These ODE-based models tend to perform slow and require large memory due to sequential operations and a complex ODE solver. As an alternative to complex ODE-based models, we propose a family of models called Functional Latent Dynamics (FLD). Instead of solving the ODE, we use simple curves which exist at all time points to specify the continuous latent state in the model. The coefficients of these curves are learned only from the observed values in the time series ignoring the missing values. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FLD achieves better performance compared to the best ODE-based model while reducing the runtime and memory overhead. Specifically, FLD requires an order of magnitude less time to infer the forecasts compared to the best performing forecasting model.</description>

      <title>Residual-based Attention Physics-informed Neural Networks for Spatio-Temporal Ageing Assessment of Transformers Operated in Renewable Power Plants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers are crucial for reliable and efficient power system operations, particularly in supporting the integration of renewable energy. Effective monitoring of transformer health is critical to maintain grid stability and performance. Thermal insulation ageing is a key transformer failure mode, which is generally tracked by monitoring the hotspot temperature (HST). However, HST measurement is complex, costly, and often estimated from indirect measurements. Existing HST models focus on space-agnostic thermal models, providing worst-case HST estimates. This article introduces a spatio-temporal model for transformer winding temperature and ageing estimation, which leverages physics-based partial differential equations (PDEs) with data-driven Neural Networks (NN) in a Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) configuration to improve prediction accuracy and acquire spatio-temporal resolution. The computational accuracy of the PINN model is improved through the implementation of the Residual-Based Attention (PINN-RBA) scheme that accelerates the PINN model convergence. The PINN-RBA model is benchmarked against self-adaptive attention schemes and classical vanilla PINN configurations. For the first time, PINN based oil temperature predictions are used to estimate spatio-temporal transformer winding temperature values, validated through PDE numerical solution and fiber optic sensor measurements. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal transformer ageing model is inferred, which supports transformer health management decision-making. Results are validated with a distribution transformer operating on a floating photovoltaic power plant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09589v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of foundation models (FMs) across language, image, audio, and video domains has shown remarkable capabilities in diverse tasks. However, the proliferation of FMs brings forth a critical challenge: the potential to generate hallucinated outputs, particularly in high-stakes applications. The tendency of foundation models to produce hallucinated content arguably represents the biggest hindrance to their widespread adoption in real-world scenarios, especially in domains where reliability and accuracy are paramount. This survey paper presents a comprehensive overview of recent developments that aim to identify and mitigate the problem of hallucination in FMs, spanning text, image, video, and audio modalities. By synthesizing recent advancements in detecting and mitigating hallucination across various modalities, the paper aims to provide valuable insights for researchers, developers, and practitioners. Essentially, it establishes a clear framework encompassing definition, taxonomy, and detection strategies for addressing hallucination in multimodal foundation models, laying the foundation for future research in this pivotal area.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Online Conformal Prediction with Semi-Bandit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction has emerged as an effective strategy for uncertainty quantification by modifying a model to output sets of labels instead of a single label. These prediction sets come with the guarantee that they contain the true label with high probability. However, conformal prediction typically requires a large calibration dataset of i.i.d. examples. We consider the online learning setting, where examples arrive over time, and the goal is to construct prediction sets dynamically. Departing from existing work, we assume semi-bandit feedback, where we only observe the true label if it is contained in the prediction set. For instance, consider calibrating a document retrieval model to a new domain; in this setting, a user would only be able to provide the true label if the target document is in the prediction set of retrieved documents. We propose a novel conformal prediction algorithm targeted at this setting, and prove that it obtains sublinear regret compared to the optimal conformal predictor. We evaluate our algorithm on a retrieval task, an image classification task, and an auction price-setting task, and demonstrate that it empirically achieves good performance compared to several baselines.</description>

Abstract: We present a constructive universal approximation theorem for learning machines equipped with joint-group-equivariant feature maps, based on the group representation theory. ``Constructive'' here indicates that the distribution of parameters is given in a closed-form expression known as the ridgelet transform. Joint-group-equivariance encompasses a broad class of feature maps that generalize classical group-equivariance. Notably, this class includes fully-connected networks, which are not group-equivariant but are joint-group-equivariant. Moreover, our main theorem also unifies the universal approximation theorems for both shallow and deep networks. While the universality of shallow networks has been investigated in a unified manner by the ridgelet transform, the universality of deep networks has been investigated in a case-by-case manner.</description>

      <title>A Study of Posterior Stability for Time-Series Latent Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Latent diffusion has demonstrated promising results in image generation and permits efficient sampling. However, this framework might suffer from the problem of posterior collapse when applied to time series. In this paper, we first show that posterior collapse will reduce latent diffusion to a variational autoencoder (VAE), making it less expressive. This highlights the importance of addressing this issue. We then introduce a principled method: dependency measure, that quantifies the sensitivity of a recurrent decoder to input variables. Using this tool, we confirm that posterior collapse significantly affects time-series latent diffusion on real datasets, and a phenomenon termed dependency illusion is also discovered in the case of shuffled time series. Finally, building on our theoretical and empirical studies, we introduce a new framework that extends latent diffusion and has a stable posterior. Extensive experiments on multiple real time-series datasets show that our new framework is free from posterior collapse and significantly outperforms previous baselines in time series synthesis.</description>

      <title>Graph Sparsification via Mixture of Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance across various graph learning tasks but face significant computational challenges when applied to large-scale graphs. One effective approach to mitigate these challenges is graph sparsification, which involves removing non-essential edges to reduce computational overhead. However, previous graph sparsification methods often rely on a single global sparsity setting and uniform pruning criteria, failing to provide customized sparsification schemes for each node's complex local context. In this paper, we introduce Mixture-of-Graphs (MoG), leveraging the concept of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), to dynamically select tailored pruning solutions for each node. Specifically, MoG incorporates multiple sparsifier experts, each characterized by unique sparsity levels and pruning criteria, and selects the appropriate experts for each node. Subsequently, MoG performs a mixture of the sparse graphs produced by different experts on the Grassmann manifold to derive an optimal sparse graph. One notable property of MoG is its entirely local nature, as it depends on the specific circumstances of each individual node. Extensive experiments on four large-scale OGB datasets and two superpixel datasets, equipped with five GNN backbones, demonstrate that MoG (I) identifies subgraphs at higher sparsity levels ($8.67\%\sim 50.85\%$), with performance equal to or better than the dense graph, (II) achieves $1.47-2.62\times$ speedup in GNN inference with negligible performance drop, and (III) boosts ``top-student'' GNN performance ($1.02\%\uparrow$ on RevGNN+\textsc{ogbn-proteins} and $1.74\%\uparrow$ on DeeperGCN+\textsc{ogbg-ppa}).</description>

      <title>Co-Representation Neural Hypergraph Diffusion for Edge-Dependent Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are widely employed to represent complex higher-order relations in real-world applications. Most hypergraph learning research focuses on node-level or edge-level tasks. A practically relevant but more challenging task, edge-dependent node classification (ENC), is only recently proposed. In ENC, a node can have different labels across different hyperedges, which requires the modeling of node-edge pairs instead of single nodes or hyperedges. Existing solutions for this task are based on message passing and model interactions in within-edge and within-node structures as multi-input single-output functions. This brings three limitations: (1) non-adaptive representation size, (2) non-adaptive messages, and (3) insufficient direct interactions among nodes or edges. To tackle these limitations, we propose CoNHD, a new ENC solution that models both within-edge and within-node interactions as multi-input multi-output functions. Specifically, we represent these interactions as a hypergraph diffusion process on node-edge co-representations. We further develop a neural implementation for this diffusion process, which can adapt to a specific ENC dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed CoNHD method.</description>

      <title>E(n) Equivariant Topological Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Graph neural networks excel at modeling pairwise interactions, but they cannot flexibly accommodate higher-order interactions and features. Topological deep learning (TDL) has emerged recently as a promising tool for addressing this issue. TDL enables the principled modeling of arbitrary multi-way, hierarchical higher-order interactions by operating on combinatorial topological spaces, such as simplicial or cell complexes, instead of graphs. However, little is known about how to leverage geometric features such as positions and velocities for TDL. This paper introduces E(n)-Equivariant Topological Neural Networks (ETNNs), which are E(n)-equivariant message-passing networks operating on combinatorial complexes, formal objects unifying graphs, hypergraphs, simplicial, path, and cell complexes. ETNNs incorporate geometric node features while respecting rotation, reflection, and translation equivariance. Moreover, ETNNs are natively ready for settings with heterogeneous interactions. We provide a theoretical analysis to show the improved expressiveness of ETNNs over architectures for geometric graphs. We also show how E(n)-equivariant variants of TDL models can be directly derived from our framework. The broad applicability of ETNNs is demonstrated through two tasks of vastly different scales: i) molecular property prediction on the QM9 benchmark and ii) land-use regression for hyper-local estimation of air pollution with multi-resolution irregular geospatial data. The results indicate that ETNNs are an effective tool for learning from diverse types of richly structured data, as they match or surpass SotA equivariant TDL models with a significantly smaller computational burden, thus highlighting the benefits of a principled geometric inductive bias.</description>

Abstract: Neural Processes (NPs) are deep probabilistic models that represent stochastic processes by conditioning their prior distributions on a set of context points. Despite their obvious advantages in uncertainty estimation for complex distributions, NPs enforce parameterization coupling between the conditional prior model and the posterior model, thereby risking introducing a misspecified prior distribution. We hereby revisit the NP objectives and propose R\'enyi Neural Processes (RNP) to ameliorate the impacts of prior misspecification by optimizing an alternative posterior that achieves better marginal likelihood. More specifically, by replacing the standard KL divergence with the R\'enyi divergence between the model posterior and the true posterior, we scale the density ratio $\frac{p}{q}$ by the power of (1-$\alpha$) in the divergence gradients with respect to the posterior. This hyper parameter $\alpha$ allows us to dampen the effects of the misspecified prior for the posterior update, which has been shown to effectively avoid oversmoothed predictions and improve the expressiveness of the posterior model. Our extensive experiments show consistent log-likelihood improvements over state-of-the-art NP family models which adopt both the variational inference or maximum likelihood estimation objectives. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple benchmarks including regression and image inpainting tasks, and show significant performance improvements of RNPs in real-world regression problems where the underlying prior model is misspecifed.</description>

      <title>LDMol: Text-to-Molecule Diffusion Model with Structurally Informative Latent Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the emergence of diffusion models as the frontline of generative models, many researchers have proposed molecule generation techniques with conditional diffusion models. However, the unavoidable discreteness of a molecule makes it difficult for a diffusion model to connect raw data with highly complex conditions like natural language. To address this, we present a novel latent diffusion model dubbed LDMol for text-conditioned molecule generation. LDMol comprises a molecule autoencoder that produces a learnable and structurally informative feature space, and a natural language-conditioned latent diffusion model. In particular, recognizing that multiple SMILES notations can represent the same molecule, we employ a contrastive learning strategy to extract feature space that is aware of the unique characteristics of the molecule structure. LDMol outperforms the existing baselines on the text-to-molecule generation benchmark, suggesting a potential for diffusion models can outperform autoregressive models in text data generation with a better choice of the latent domain. Furthermore, we show that LDMol can be applied to downstream tasks such as molecule-to-text retrieval and text-guided molecule editing, demonstrating its versatility as a diffusion model.</description>

      <title>MGDA Converges under Generalized Smoothness, Provably</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19440v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization (MOO) is receiving more attention in various fields such as multi-task learning. Recent works provide some effective algorithms with theoretical analysis but they are limited by the standard $L$-smooth or bounded-gradient assumptions, which typically do not hold for neural networks, such as Long short-term memory (LSTM) models and Transformers. In this paper, we study a more general and realistic class of generalized $\ell$-smooth loss functions, where $\ell$ is a general non-decreasing function of gradient norm. We revisit and analyze the fundamental multiple gradient descent algorithm (MGDA) and its stochastic version with double sampling for solving the generalized $\ell$-smooth MOO problems, which approximate the conflict-avoidant (CA) direction that maximizes the minimum improvement among objectives. We provide a comprehensive convergence analysis of these algorithms and show that they converge to an $\epsilon$-accurate Pareto stationary point with a guaranteed $\epsilon$-level average CA distance (i.e., the gap between the updating direction and the CA direction) over all iterations, where totally $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ samples are needed for deterministic and stochastic settings, respectively. We prove that they can also guarantee a tighter $\epsilon$-level CA distance in each iteration using more samples. Moreover, we analyze an efficient variant of MGDA named MGDA-FA using only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time and space, while achieving the same performance guarantee as MGDA.</description>

      <title>Optimal Rates for $O(1)$-Smooth DP-SCO with a Single Epoch and Large Batches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit the DP stochastic convex optimization (SCO) problem. For convex smooth losses, it is well-known that the canonical DP-SGD (stochastic gradient descent) achieves the optimal rate of $O\left(\frac{LR}{\sqrt{n}} + \frac{LR \sqrt{p \log(1/\delta)}}{\epsilon n}\right)$ under $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP, and also well-known that variants of DP-SGD can achieve the optimal rate in a single epoch. However, the batch gradient complexity (i.e., number of adaptive optimization steps), which is important in applications like federated learning, is less well-understood. In particular, all prior work on DP-SCO requires $\Omega(n)$ batch gradient steps, multiple epochs, or convexity for privacy.
  We propose an algorithm, Accelerated-DP-SRGD (stochastic recursive gradient descent), which bypasses the limitations of past work: it achieves the optimal rate for DP-SCO (up to polylog factors), in a single epoch using $\sqrt{n}$ batch gradient steps with batch size $\sqrt{n}$, and can be made private for arbitrary (non-convex) losses via clipping. If the global minimizer is in the constraint set, we can further improve this to $n^{1/4}$ batch gradient steps with batch size $n^{3/4}$. To achieve this, our algorithm combines three key ingredients, a variant of stochastic recursive gradients (SRG), accelerated gradient descent, and correlated noise generation from DP continual counting.</description>

      <title>Securing Equal Share: A Principled Approach for Learning Multiplayer Symmetric Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines multiplayer symmetric constant-sum games with more than two players in a competitive setting, including examples like Mahjong, Poker, and various board and video games. In contrast to two-player zero-sum games, equilibria in multiplayer games are neither unique nor non-exploitable, failing to provide meaningful guarantees when competing against opponents who play different equilibria or non-equilibrium strategies. This gives rise to a series of long-lasting fundamental questions in multiplayer games regarding suitable objectives, solution concepts, and principled algorithms. This paper takes an initial step towards addressing these challenges by focusing on the natural objective of equal share -- securing an expected payoff of C/n in an n-player symmetric game with a total payoff of C. We rigorously identify the theoretical conditions under which achieving an equal share is tractable and design a series of efficient algorithms, inspired by no-regret learning, that provably attain approximate equal share across various settings. Furthermore, we provide complementary lower bounds that justify the sharpness of our theoretical results. Our experimental results highlight worst-case scenarios where meta-algorithms from prior state-of-the-art systems for multiplayer games fail to secure an equal share, while our algorithm succeeds, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of big data, access to abundant data is crucial for driving research forward. However, such data is often inaccessible due to privacy concerns or high costs, particularly in healthcare domain. Generating synthetic (tabular) data can address this, but existing models typically require substantial amounts of data to train effectively, contradicting our objective to solve data scarcity. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework to generate synthetic tabular data, powered by large language models (LLMs) that emulates the architecture of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). By incorporating data generation process as contextual information and utilizing LLM as the optimizer, our approach significantly enhance the quality of synthetic data generation in common scenarios with small sample sizes. Our experimental results on public and private datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state-of-art models regarding generating higher quality synthetic data for downstream tasks while keeping privacy of the real data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we optimize speculative sampling for parallel hardware accelerators to improve sampling speed. We notice that substantial portions of the intermediate matrices necessary for speculative sampling can be computed concurrently. This allows us to distribute the workload across multiple GPU threads, enabling simultaneous operations on matrix segments within thread blocks. This results in profiling time improvements ranging from 6% to 13% relative to the baseline implementation, without compromising accuracy. To further accelerate speculative sampling, probability distributions parameterized by softmax are approximated by sigmoid. This approximation approach results in significantly greater relative improvements in profiling time, ranging from 37% to 94%, with a minor decline in accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments on both automatic speech recognition and summarization tasks to validate the effectiveness of our optimization methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting drug efficacy and safety in vivo requires information on biological responses (e.g., cell morphology and gene expression) to small molecule perturbations. However, current molecular representation learning methods do not provide a comprehensive view of cell states under these perturbations and struggle to remove noise, hindering model generalization. We introduce the Information Alignment (InfoAlign) approach to learn molecular representations through the information bottleneck method in cells. We integrate molecules and cellular response data as nodes into a context graph, connecting them with weighted edges based on chemical, biological, and computational criteria. For each molecule in a training batch, InfoAlign optimizes the encoder's latent representation with a minimality objective to discard redundant structural information. A sufficiency objective decodes the representation to align with different feature spaces from the molecule's neighborhood in the context graph. We demonstrate that the proposed sufficiency objective for alignment is tighter than existing encoder-based contrastive methods. Empirically, we validate representations from InfoAlign in two downstream applications: molecular property prediction against up to 27 baseline methods across four datasets, plus zero-shot molecule-morphology matching.</description>

Abstract: Artificially intelligent agents are increasingly being integrated into human decision-making: from large language model (LLM) assistants to autonomous vehicles. These systems often optimize their individual objective, leading to conflicts, particularly in general-sum games where naive reinforcement learning agents empirically converge to Pareto-suboptimal Nash equilibria. To address this issue, opponent shaping has emerged as a paradigm for finding socially beneficial equilibria in general-sum games. In this work, we introduce Advantage Alignment, a family of algorithms derived from first principles that perform opponent shaping efficiently and intuitively. We achieve this by aligning the advantages of interacting agents, increasing the probability of mutually beneficial actions when their interaction has been positive. We prove that existing opponent shaping methods implicitly perform Advantage Alignment. Compared to these methods, Advantage Alignment simplifies the mathematical formulation of opponent shaping, reduces the computational burden and extends to continuous action domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms across a range of social dilemmas, achieving state-of-the-art cooperation and robustness against exploitation.</description>

Abstract: While scaling Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated promising performance across various tasks, it also introduces redundant architectures, posing efficiency challenges for real-world deployment. Despite some recognition of redundancy in LLMs, the variability of redundancy across different architectures in transformers, such as MLP and Attention layers, is under-explored. In this work, we investigate redundancy across different modules within Transformers, including Blocks, MLP, and Attention layers, using a similarity-based metric. Surprisingly, despite the critical role of attention layers in distinguishing transformers from other architectures, we found that a large portion of these layers exhibit excessively high similarity and can be pruned without degrading performance. For instance, Llama-2-70B achieved a 48.4\% speedup with only a 2.4\% performance drop by pruning half of the attention layers. Furthermore, by tracing model checkpoints throughout the training process, we observed that attention layer redundancy is inherent and consistent across training stages. Additionally, we further propose a method that jointly drops Attention and MLP layers, allowing us to more aggressively drop additional layers. For instance, when dropping 31 layers (Attention + MLP), Llama-2-13B still retains 90\% of the performance on the MMLU task. Our work provides valuable insights for future network architecture design. The code is released at: \url{https://github.com/Shwai-He/LLM-Drop}.</description>

      <title>Repulsive Latent Score Distillation for Solving Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) has been pivotal for leveraging pre-trained diffusion models in downstream tasks such as inverse problems, but it faces two major challenges: $(i)$ mode collapse and $(ii)$ latent space inversion, which become more pronounced in high-dimensional data. To address mode collapse, we introduce a novel variational framework for posterior sampling. Utilizing the Wasserstein gradient flow interpretation of SDS, we propose a multimodal variational approximation with a repulsion mechanism that promotes diversity among particles by penalizing pairwise kernel-based similarity. This repulsion acts as a simple regularizer, encouraging a more diverse set of solutions. To mitigate latent space ambiguity, we extend this framework with an augmented variational distribution that disentangles the latent and data. This repulsive augmented formulation balances computational efficiency, quality, and diversity. Extensive experiments on linear and nonlinear inverse tasks with high-resolution images ($512 \times 512$) using pre-trained Stable Diffusion models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Jailbreaking LLMs with Arabic Transliteration and Arabizi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study identifies the potential vulnerabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to 'jailbreak' attacks, specifically focusing on the Arabic language and its various forms. While most research has concentrated on English-based prompt manipulation, our investigation broadens the scope to investigate the Arabic language. We initially tested the AdvBench benchmark in Standardized Arabic, finding that even with prompt manipulation techniques like prefix injection, it was insufficient to provoke LLMs into generating unsafe content. However, when using Arabic transliteration and chatspeak (or arabizi), we found that unsafe content could be produced on platforms like OpenAI GPT-4 and Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet. Our findings suggest that using Arabic and its various forms could expose information that might remain hidden, potentially increasing the risk of jailbreak attacks. We hypothesize that this exposure could be due to the model's learned connection to specific words, highlighting the need for more comprehensive safety training across all language forms.</description>

      <title>Diff-BBO: Diffusion-Based Inverse Modeling for Black-Box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black-box optimization (BBO) aims to optimize an objective function by iteratively querying a black-box oracle in a sample-efficient way. While prior studies focus on forward approaches to learn surrogates for the unknown objective function, they struggle with steering clear of out-of-distribution and invalid inputs. Recently, inverse modeling approaches that map objective space to the design space with conditional diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capability in learning the data manifold. They have shown promising performance in offline BBO tasks. However, these approaches require a pre-collected dataset. How to design the acquisition function for inverse modeling to actively query new data remains an open question. In this work, we propose diffusion-based inverse modeling for black-box optimization (Diff-BBO), an inverse approach leveraging diffusion models for online BBO problem. Instead of proposing candidates in the design space, Diff-BBO employs a novel acquisition function Uncertainty-aware Exploration (UaE) to propose objective function values. Subsequently, we employ a conditional diffusion model to generate samples based on these proposed values within the design space. We demonstrate that using UaE results in optimal optimization outcomes, supported by both theoretical and empirical evidence.</description>

      <title>Iterative Nash Policy Optimization: Aligning LLMs with General Preferences via No-Regret Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has achieved great success in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Prevalent RLHF approaches are reward-based, following the Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumption, which may not fully capture the complexity of human preferences. In this paper, we explore RLHF under a general preference framework and approach it from a game-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a two-player game and propose a novel online algorithm, iterative Nash policy optimization (INPO). The key idea is to let the policy play against itself via no-regret learning, thereby approximating the Nash policy. Unlike previous methods, INPO bypasses the need for estimating the expected win rate for individual responses, which typically incurs high computational or annotation costs. Instead, we introduce a new loss objective that is directly minimized over a preference dataset. We provide theoretical analysis for our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on various representative benchmarks. With an LLaMA-3-8B-based SFT model, INPO achieves a 42.6% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 and a 37.8% win rate on Arena-Hard, showing substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art online RLHF algorithms.</description>

      <title>Effective Heterogeneous Federated Learning via Efficient Hypernetwork-based Weight Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While federated learning leverages distributed client resources, it faces challenges due to heterogeneous client capabilities. This necessitates allocating models suited to clients' resources and careful parameter aggregation to accommodate this heterogeneity. We propose HypeMeFed, a novel federated learning framework for supporting client heterogeneity by combining a multi-exit network architecture with hypernetwork-based model weight generation. This approach aligns the feature spaces of heterogeneous model layers and resolves per-layer information disparity during weight aggregation. To practically realize HypeMeFed, we also propose a low-rank factorization approach to minimize computation and memory overhead associated with hypernetworks. Our evaluations on a real-world heterogeneous device testbed indicate that \system enhances accuracy by 5.12% over FedAvg, reduces the hypernetwork memory requirements by 98.22%, and accelerates its operations by 1.86x compared to a naive hypernetwork approach. These results demonstrate HypeMeFed's effectiveness in leveraging and engaging heterogeneous clients for federated learning.</description>

      <title>Reduced-Order Neural Operators: Learning Lagrangian Dynamics on Highly Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose accelerating the simulation of Lagrangian dynamics, such as fluid flows, granular flows, and elastoplasticity, with neural-operator-based reduced-order modeling. While full-order approaches simulate the physics of every particle within the system, incurring high computation time for dense inputs, we propose to simulate the physics on sparse graphs constructed by sampling from the spatially discretized system. Our discretization-invariant reduced-order framework trains on any spatial discretizations and computes temporal dynamics on any sparse sampling of these discretizations through neural operators. Our proposed approach is termed Graph Informed Optimized Reduced-Order Modeling or \textit{GIOROM}. Through reduced order modeling, we ensure lower computation time by sparsifying the system by 6.6-32.0$\times$, while ensuring high-fidelity full-order inference via neural fields. We show that our model generalizes to a range of initial conditions, resolutions, and materials. The code and the demos are provided at \url{https://github.com/HrishikeshVish/GIOROM}</description>

      <title>Robustness of Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Industrial Process Modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims at providing understandable explanations of black box models. In this paper, we evaluate current XAI methods by scoring them based on ground truth simulations and sensitivity analysis. To this end, we used an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) model to better understand the limits and robustness characteristics of XAI methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), as well as Averaged Local Effects (ALE) or Smooth Gradients (SG) in a highly topical setting. These XAI methods were applied to various types of black-box models and then scored based on their correctness compared to the ground-truth sensitivity of the data-generating processes using a novel scoring evaluation methodology over a range of simulated additive noise. The resulting evaluation shows that the capability of the Machine Learning (ML) models to capture the process accurately is, indeed, coupled with the correctness of the explainability of the underlying data-generating process. We furthermore show the differences between XAI methods in their ability to correctly predict the true sensitivity of the modeled industrial process.</description>

      <title>Fast Matrix Multiplications for Lookup Table-Quantized LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by memory bandwidth, where the primary bottleneck is the cost of transferring model parameters from the GPU's global memory to its registers. When coupled with custom kernels that fuse the dequantization and matmul operations, weight-only quantization can thus enable faster inference by reducing the amount of memory movement. However, developing high-performance kernels for weight-quantized LLMs presents substantial challenges, especially when the weights are compressed to non-evenly-divisible bit widths (e.g., 3 bits) with non-uniform, lookup table (LUT) quantization. This paper describes FLUTE, a flexible lookup table engine for LUT-quantized LLMs, which uses offline restructuring of the quantized weight matrix to minimize bit manipulations associated with unpacking, and vectorization and duplication of the lookup table to mitigate shared memory bandwidth constraints. At batch sizes &lt; 32 and quantization group size of 128 (typical in LLM inference), the FLUTE kernel can be 2-4x faster than existing GEMM kernels. As an application of FLUTE, we explore a simple extension to lookup table-based NormalFloat quantization and apply it to quantize LLaMA3 to various configurations, obtaining competitive quantization performance against strong baselines while obtaining an end-to-end throughput increase of 1.5 to 2 times.</description>

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) has emerged as a widely accepted diagnostic instrument for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The standard clinical 12-lead ECG configuration causes considerable inconvenience and discomfort, while wearable devices offers a more practical alternative. To reduce information gap between 12-lead ECG and single-lead ECG, this study proposes a multi-channel masked autoencoder (MCMA) for reconstructing 12-Lead ECG from arbitrary single-lead ECG, and a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, ECGGenEval, encompass the signal-level, feature-level, and diagnostic-level evaluations. MCMA can achieve the state-of-the-art performance. In the signal-level evaluation, the mean square errors of 0.0317 and 0.1034, Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.7885 and 0.7420. In the feature-level evaluation, the average standard deviation of the mean heart rate across the generated 12-lead ECG is 1.0481, the coefficient of variation is 1.58%, and the range is 3.2874. In the diagnostic-level evaluation, the average F1-score with two generated 12-lead ECG from different single-lead ECG are 0.8233 and 0.8410.</description>

      <title>Urban Traffic Forecasting with Integrated Travel Time and Data Availability in a Conformal Graph Neural Network Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic flow prediction is a big challenge for transportation authorities as it helps plan and develop better infrastructure. State-of-the-art models often struggle to consider the data in the best way possible, as well as intrinsic uncertainties and the actual physics of the traffic. In this study, we propose a novel framework to incorporate travel times between stations into a weighted adjacency matrix of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture with information from traffic stations based on their data availability. To handle uncertainty, we utilized the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP) method that adjusts prediction intervals based on real-time validation residuals. To validate our results, we model a microscopic traffic scenario and perform a Monte-Carlo simulation to get a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under Test (VUT), and this distribution is compared against the real-world data. Experiments show that the proposed model outperformed the next-best model by approximately 24% in MAE and 8% in RMSE and validation showed the simulated travel time closely matches the 95th percentile of the observed travel time value.</description>

      <title>Ensemble data assimilation to diagnose AI-based weather prediction model: A case with ClimaX version 0.3.1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based weather prediction research is growing rapidly and has shown to be competitive with the advanced dynamic numerical weather prediction models. However, research combining AI-based weather prediction models with data assimilation remains limited partially because long-term sequential data assimilation cycles are required to evaluate data assimilation systems. This study proposes using ensemble data assimilation for diagnosing AI-based weather prediction models, and marked the first successful implementation of ensemble Kalman filter with AI-based weather prediction models. Our experiments with an AI-based model ClimaX demonstrated that the ensemble data assimilation cycled stably for the AI-based weather prediction model using covariance inflation and localization techniques within the ensemble Kalman filter. While ClimaX showed some limitations in capturing flow-dependent error covariance compared to dynamical models, the AI-based ensemble forecasts provided reasonable and beneficial error covariance in sparsely observed regions. In addition, ensemble data assimilation revealed that error growth based on ensemble ClimaX predictions was weaker than that of dynamical NWP models, leading to higher inflation factors. A series of experiments demonstrated that ensemble data assimilation can be used to diagnose properties of AI weather prediction models such as physical consistency and accurate error growth representation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Group Fairness in Federated Learning through Personalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (FL) algorithms collaboratively train customized models for each client, enhancing the accuracy of the learned models on the client's local data (e.g., by clustering similar clients, by fine-tuning models locally, or by imposing regularization terms). In this paper, we investigate the impact of such personalization techniques on the group fairness of the learned models, and show that personalization can also lead to improved (local) fairness as an unintended benefit. We begin by illustrating these benefits of personalization through numerical experiments comparing several classes of personalized FL algorithms against a baseline FedAvg algorithm, elaborating on the reasons behind improved fairness using personalized FL, and then providing analytical support. Motivated by these, we then show how to build on this (unintended) fairness benefit, by further integrating a fairness metric into the cluster-selection procedure of clustering-based personalized FL algorithms, and improve the fairness-accuracy trade-off attainable through them. Specifically, we propose two new fairness-aware federated clustering algorithms, Fair-FCA and Fair-FL+HC, extending the existing IFCA and FL+HC algorithms, and demonstrate their ability to strike a (tuneable) balance between accuracy and fairness at the client level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the successes and progress of deep reinforcement learning over the last decade, several challenges remain that hinder its broader application. Some fundamental aspects to improve include data efficiency, generalization capability, and ability to learn in sparse-reward environments, which often require human-designed dense rewards. Meta-learning has emerged as a promising approach to address these issues by optimizing components of the learning algorithm to meet desired characteristics. Additionally, a different line of work has extensively studied the use of intrinsic rewards to enhance the exploration capabilities of algorithms. This work investigates how meta-learning can improve the training signal received by RL agents. The focus is on meta-learning intrinsic rewards under a framework that doesn't rely on the use of meta-gradients. We analyze and compare this approach to the use of extrinsic rewards and a meta-learned advantage function. The developed algorithms are evaluated on distributions of continuous control tasks with both parametric and non-parametric variations, and with only sparse rewards accessible for the evaluation tasks.</description>

      <title>In2Core: Leveraging Influence Functions for Coreset Selection in Instruction Finetuning of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite advancements, fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) remains costly due to the extensive parameter count and substantial data requirements for model generalization. Accessibility to computing resources remains a barrier for the open-source community. To address this challenge, we propose the In2Core algorithm, which selects a coreset by analyzing the correlation between training and evaluation samples with a trained model. Notably, we assess the model's internal gradients to estimate this relationship, aiming to rank the contribution of each training point. To enhance efficiency, we propose an optimization to compute influence functions with a reduced number of layers while achieving similar accuracy. By applying our algorithm to instruction fine-tuning data of LLMs, we can achieve similar performance with just 50% of the training data. Meantime, using influence functions to analyze model coverage to certain testing samples could provide a reliable and interpretable signal on the training set's coverage of those test points.</description>

      <title>PowerPM: Foundation Model for Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of abundant electricity time series (ETS) data provides ample opportunities for various applications in the power systems, including demand-side management, grid stability, and consumer behavior analysis. Deep learning models have advanced ETS modeling by effectively capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, learning a generic representation of ETS data for various applications remains challenging due to the inherently complex hierarchical structure of ETS data. Moreover, ETS data exhibits intricate temporal dependencies and is suscepti ble to the influence of exogenous variables. Furthermore, different instances exhibit diverse electricity consumption behavior. In this paper, we propose a foundation model PowerPM to model ETS data, providing a large-scale, off-the-shelf model for power systems. PowerPM consists of a temporal encoder and a hierarchical encoder. The temporal encoder captures both temporal dependencies in ETS data, considering exogenous variables. The hierarchical encoder models the correlation between hierarchy. Furthermore, PowerPM leverages a novel self-supervised pretraining framework consisting of masked ETS modeling and dual-view contrastive learning, which enable PowerPM to capture temporal dependency within ETS windows and aware the discrepancy across ETS windows, providing two different perspectives to learn generic representation. Our experiments involve five real world scenario datasets, comprising private and public data. Through pre-training on massive ETS data, PowerPM achieves SOTA performance on diverse downstream tasks within the private dataset. Impressively, when transferred to the public datasets, PowerPM maintains its superiority, showcasing its remarkable generalization ability across various tasks and domains. Moreover, ablation studies, few-shot experiments provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of our model.</description>

      <title>UCB Exploration for Fixed-Budget Bayesian Best Arm Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study best-arm identification (BAI) in the fixed-budget setting. Adaptive allocations based on upper confidence bounds (UCBs), such as UCBE, are known to work well in BAI. However, it is well-known that its optimal regret is theoretically dependent on instances, which we show to be an artifact in many fixed-budget BAI problems. In this paper we propose an UCB exploration algorithm that is both theoretically and empirically efficient for the fixed budget BAI problem under a Bayesian setting. The key idea is to learn prior information, which can enhance the performance of UCB-based BAI algorithm as it has done in the cumulative regret minimization problem. We establish bounds on the failure probability and the simple regret for the Bayesian BAI problem, providing upper bounds of order $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{K/n})$, up to logarithmic factors, where $n$ represents the budget and $K$ denotes the number of arms. Furthermore, we demonstrate through empirical results that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore different approaches to anomaly detection on dynamic knowledge graphs, specifically in a microservices environment for Kubernetes applications. Our approach explores three dynamic knowledge graph representations: sequential data, one-hop graph structure, and two-hop graph structure, with each representation incorporating increasingly complex structural information. Each phase includes different machine learning and deep learning models. We empirically analyse their performance and propose an approach based on ensemble learning of these models. Our approach significantly outperforms the baseline on the ISWC 2024 Dynamic Knowledge Graph Anomaly Detection dataset, providing a robust solution for anomaly detection in dynamic complex data.</description>

      <title>q-exponential family for policy optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Policy optimization methods benefit from a simple and tractable policy parametrization, usually the Gaussian for continuous action spaces. In this paper, we consider a broader policy family that remains tractable: the $q$-exponential family. This family of policies is flexible, allowing the specification of both heavy-tailed policies ($q&gt;1$) and light-tailed policies ($q&lt;1$). This paper examines the interplay between $q$-exponential policies for several actor-critic algorithms conducted on both online and offline problems. We find that heavy-tailed policies are more effective in general and can consistently improve on Gaussian. In particular, we find the Student's t-distribution to be more stable than the Gaussian across settings and that a heavy-tailed $q$-Gaussian for Tsallis Advantage Weighted Actor-Critic consistently performs well in offline benchmark problems.

      <title>Derivative-Free Guidance in Continuous and Discrete Diffusion Models with Soft Value-Based Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08252v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at capturing the natural design spaces of images, molecules, DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. However, rather than merely generating designs that are natural, we often aim to optimize downstream reward functions while preserving the naturalness of these design spaces. Existing methods for achieving this goal often require ``differentiable'' proxy models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier guidance or DPS) or involve computationally expensive fine-tuning of diffusion models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier-free guidance, RL-based fine-tuning). In our work, we propose a new method to address these challenges. Our algorithm is an iterative sampling method that integrates soft value functions, which looks ahead to how intermediate noisy states lead to high rewards in the future, into the standard inference procedure of pre-trained diffusion models. Notably, our approach avoids fine-tuning generative models and eliminates the need to construct differentiable models. This enables us to (1) directly utilize non-differentiable features/reward feedback, commonly used in many scientific domains, and (2) apply our method to recent discrete diffusion models in a principled way. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across several domains, including image generation, molecule generation, and DNA/RNA sequence generation.

      <title>Simplified Mamba with Disentangled Dependency Encoding for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to the development of numerous models for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). However, most approaches still struggle to comprehensively capture reliable and informative dependencies inherent in time series data. In this paper, we identify and formally define three critical dependencies essential for improving forecasting accuracy: the order dependency and semantic dependency in the time dimension as well as cross-variate dependency in the variate dimension. Despite their significance, these dependencies are rarely considered holistically in existing models. Moreover, improper handling of these dependencies can introduce harmful noise that significantly impairs forecasting performance. To address these challenges, we explore the potential of Mamba for LTSF, highlighting its three key advantages to capture three dependencies, respectively. We further empirically observe that nonlinear activation functions used in vanilla Mamba are redundant for semantically sparse time series data. Therefore, we propose SAMBA, a Simplified Mamba with disentangled dependency encoding. Specifically, we first eliminate the nonlinearity of vanilla Mamba to make it more suitable for LTSF. Along this line, we propose a disentangled dependency encoding strategy to endow Mamba with efficient cross-variate dependency modeling capability while minimizing the interference between time and variate dimensions. We also provide rigorous theory as a justification for our design. Extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SAMBA over state-of-the-art forecasting models.</description>

      <title>SORSA: Singular Values and Orthonormal Regularized Singular Vectors Adaptation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00055v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) comes with a significant increase in their parameter size, presenting challenges for adaptation and fine-tuning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to adapt LLMs for downstream tasks efficiently. In this paper, we propose Singular Values and Orthonormal Regularized Singular Vectors Adaptation, or SORSA, a novel PEFT method. We introduce a method to analyze the variation of the parameters by performing singular value decomposition (SVD) and discuss and analyze SORSA's superiority in minimizing the alteration in the SVD aspect. Each SORSA adapter consists of two main parts: trainable principal singular weights $W_p = U_p \text{diag}(S_p) V^\top_p$, and frozen residual weights $W_r = U_r \text{diag}(S_r) V^\top_r$. These parts are initialized by performing SVD on pre-trained weights. Moreover, we implement and analyze an orthonormal regularizer, which we prove could decrease the condition number of $W_p$ and allows the optimization to be more efficient. SORSA adapters could be merged during inference, thus eliminating any inference latency. After all, SORSA shows a faster convergence than PiSSA and LoRA in our experiments. On the GSM-8K benchmark, Llama 2 7B adapted using SORSA achieved 56.03% accuracy, surpassing LoRA (42.30%), Full FT (49.05%), and PiSSA (53.07%). On the MATH benchmark, SORSA achieved 10.36% accuracy, outperforming LoRA (5.50%), Full FT (7.22%), and PiSSA (7.44%). We conclude that SORSA offers a new perspective on parameter-efficient fine-tuning, demonstrating remarkable performance. The code is available at https://github.com/Gunale0926/SORSA.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Large Language Model Compression -- Part 1: Weight Quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, compression of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as an important problem to enable language model deployment on resource-constrained devices, reduce computational costs, and mitigate the environmental footprint of large-scale AI infrastructure. In this paper, we lay down the foundation for LLM quantization from a convex optimization perspective and propose a quantization technique that builds on this foundation for optimum quantization outcomes. Our quantization framework, CVXQ, scales to models containing hundreds of billions of weight parameters and provides users with the flexibility to compress models to any specified model size, post-training. A reference implementation of CVXQ can be obtained from github.com/seannz/cvxq.</description>

      <title>On the Limited Generalization Capability of the Implicit Reward Model Induced by Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is an effective approach for aligning language models to human preferences. Central to RLHF is learning a reward function for scoring human preferences. Two main approaches for learning a reward model are 1) training an EXplicit Reward Model (EXRM) as in RLHF, and 2) using an implicit reward learned from preference data through methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Prior work has shown that the implicit reward model of DPO (denoted as DPORM) can approximate an EXRM in the limit. DPORM's effectiveness directly implies the optimality of the learned policy, and also has practical implication for LLM alignment methods including iterative DPO. However, it is unclear how well DPORM empirically matches the performance of EXRM. This work studies the accuracy at distinguishing preferred and rejected answers for both DPORM and EXRM. Our findings indicate that even though DPORM fits the training dataset comparably, it generalizes less effectively than EXRM, especially when the validation datasets contain distribution shifts. Across five out-of-distribution settings, DPORM has a mean drop in accuracy of 3% and a maximum drop of 7%. These findings highlight that DPORM has limited generalization ability and substantiates the integration of an explicit reward model in iterative DPO approaches.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Training with Neuron Interaction and Nowcasting Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural network training can be accelerated when a learnable update rule is used in lieu of classic adaptive optimizers (e.g. Adam). However, learnable update rules can be costly and unstable to train and use. Recently, Jang et al. (2023) proposed a simpler approach to accelerate training based on weight nowcaster networks (WNNs). In their approach, Adam is used for most of the optimization steps and periodically, only every few steps, a WNN nowcasts (predicts near future) parameters. We improve WNNs by proposing neuron interaction and nowcasting (NiNo) networks. In contrast to WNNs, NiNo leverages neuron connectivity and graph neural networks to more accurately nowcast parameters. We further show that in some networks, such as Transformers, modeling neuron connectivity accurately is challenging. We address this and other limitations, which allows NiNo to accelerate Adam training by up to 50% in vision and language tasks.</description>

      <title>Sample and Oracle Efficient Reinforcement Learning for MDPs with Linearly-Realizable Value Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing sample-efficient and computationally feasible reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms is particularly challenging in environments with large or infinite state and action spaces. In this paper, we advance this effort by presenting an efficient algorithm for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) where the state-action value function of any policy is linear in a given feature map. This challenging setting can model environments with infinite states and actions, strictly generalizes classic linear MDPs, and currently lacks a computationally efficient algorithm under online access to the MDP. Specifically, we introduce a new RL algorithm that efficiently finds a near-optimal policy in this setting, using a number of episodes and calls to a cost-sensitive classification (CSC) oracle that are both polynomial in the problem parameters. Notably, our CSC oracle can be efficiently implemented when the feature dimension is constant, representing a clear improvement over state-of-the-art methods, which require solving non-convex problems with horizon-many variables and can incur computational costs that are exponential in the horizon.</description>

Abstract: Pretraining on large-scale, unstructured internet text enables language models to acquire a significant amount of world knowledge. However, this knowledge acquisition is data-inefficient--to learn a given fact, models must be trained on hundreds to thousands of diverse representations of it. This poses a challenge when adapting a pretrained model to a small corpus of domain-specific documents, where each fact may appear rarely or only once. We propose to bridge this gap with synthetic continued pretraining: using the small domain-specific corpus to synthesize a large corpus more amenable to learning, and then performing continued pretraining on the synthesized corpus. We instantiate this proposal with EntiGraph, a synthetic data augmentation algorithm that extracts salient entities from the source documents and then generates diverse text by drawing connections between the sampled entities. Synthetic continued pretraining with EntiGraph enables a language model to answer questions and follow generic instructions related to the source documents without access to them. If, instead, the source documents are available at inference time, we show that the knowledge acquired through our approach compounds with retrieval-augmented generation. To better understand these results, we build a simple mathematical model of EntiGraph, and show how synthetic data augmentation can "rearrange" knowledge to enable more data-efficient learning.</description>

      <title>Archon: An Architecture Search Framework for Inference-Time Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15254v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inference-time techniques are emerging as highly effective tools to enhance large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, best practices for developing systems that combine these techniques remain underdeveloped due to our limited understanding of the utility of individual inference-time techniques and the interactions between them. Additionally, efficiently and automatically searching the space of model choices, inference-time techniques, and their compositions is challenging due to the large design space. To address these challenges, we introduce Archon, a modular framework for selecting, combining, and stacking layers of inference-time techniques to construct optimized LLM systems for target benchmarks. Rather than relying on a single LLM called once, we leverage a diverse set of LLMs and inference-time techniques, creating LLM systems greater than the sum of their parts. Archon defines an extensible design space, encompassing techniques such as generation ensembling, repeated sampling, ranking, fusion, critiquing, verification, and unit testing. It transforms the problem of building LLM systems into a hyperparameter optimization objective. Given the available LLMs, inference-time techniques, and compute budget, Archon utilizes hyperparameter search techniques to discover optimized architectures for target benchmark(s). We evaluate Archon architectures across a range of instruction-following, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, including MT-Bench, Arena-Hard-Auto, AlpacaEval 2.0, MixEval, MixEval Hard, MATH, and CodeContests. Archon architectures outperform frontier models, such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, on these benchmarks, achieving an average accuracy increase of 15.1 percentage points by using all available LLMs. We make our code and datasets available publicly on Github: https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/Archon.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models trained on datasets owned by different organizations and physically located in remote databases offer benefits in many real-world use cases. State regulations or business requirements often prevent data transfer to a central location, making it difficult to utilize standard machine learning algorithms. Federated Learning (FL) is a technique that enables models to learn from distributed datasets without revealing the original data. Vertical Federated learning (VFL) is a type of FL where data samples are divided by features across several data owners. For instance, in a recommendation task, a user can interact with various sets of items, and the logs of these interactions are stored by different organizations. In this demo paper, we present \emph{Stalactite} - an open-source framework for VFL that provides the necessary functionality for building prototypes of VFL systems. It has several advantages over the existing frameworks. In particular, it allows researchers to focus on the algorithmic side rather than engineering and to easily deploy learning in a distributed environment. It implements several VFL algorithms and has a built-in homomorphic encryption layer. We demonstrate its use on a real-world recommendation datasets.</description>

      <title>Symbolic State Partitioning for Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tabular reinforcement learning methods cannot operate directly on continuous state spaces. One solution for this problem is to partition the state space. A good partitioning enables generalization during learning and more efficient exploitation of prior experiences. Consequently, the learning process becomes faster and produces more reliable policies. However, partitioning introduces approximation, which is particularly harmful in the presence of nonlinear relations between state components. An ideal partition should be as coarse as possible, while capturing the key structure of the state space for the given problem. This work extracts partitions from the environment dynamics by symbolic execution. We show that symbolic partitioning improves state space coverage with respect to environmental behavior and allows reinforcement learning to perform better for sparse rewards. We evaluate symbolic state space partitioning with respect to precision, scalability, learning agent performance and state space coverage for the learnt policies.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative Logit Adjustment Approximates Neural-Collapse-Aware Decision Boundary Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world data distributions are often highly skewed. This has spurred a growing body of research on long-tailed recognition, aimed at addressing the imbalance in training classification models. Among the methods studied, multiplicative logit adjustment (MLA) stands out as a simple and effective method. What theoretical foundation explains the effectiveness of this heuristic method? We provide a justification for the effectiveness of MLA with the following two-step process. First, we develop a theory that adjusts optimal decision boundaries by estimating feature spread on the basis of neural collapse. Second, we demonstrate that MLA approximates this optimal method. Additionally, through experiments on long-tailed datasets, we illustrate the practical usefulness of MLA under more realistic conditions. We also offer experimental insights to guide the tuning of MLA hyperparameters.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification with Bayesian Higher Order ReLU KANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the first method of uncertainty quantification in the domain of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, specifically focusing on (Higher Order) ReLUKANs to enhance computational efficiency given the computational demands of Bayesian methods. The method we propose is general in nature, providing access to both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. It is also capable of generalization to other various basis functions. We validate our method through a series of closure tests, including simple one-dimensional functions and application to the domain of (Stochastic) Partial Differential Equations. Referring to the latter, we demonstrate the method's ability to correctly identify functional dependencies introduced through the inclusion of a stochastic term. The code supporting this work can be found at https://github.com/wmdataphys/Bayesian-HR-KAN</description>

      <title>MOREL: Enhancing Adversarial Robustness through Multi-Objective Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensive research has shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to slight adversarial perturbations$-$small changes to the input data that appear insignificant but cause the model to produce drastically different outputs. In addition to augmenting training data with adversarial examples generated from a specific attack method, most of the current defense strategies necessitate modifying the original model architecture components to improve robustness or performing test-time data purification to handle adversarial attacks. In this work, we demonstrate that strong feature representation learning during training can significantly enhance the original model's robustness. We propose MOREL, a multi-objective feature representation learning approach, encouraging classification models to produce similar features for inputs within the same class, despite perturbations. Our training method involves an embedding space where cosine similarity loss and multi-positive contrastive loss are used to align natural and adversarial features from the model encoder and ensure tight clustering. Concurrently, the classifier is motivated to achieve accurate predictions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of DNNs against white-box and black-box adversarial attacks, outperforming other methods that similarly require no architectural changes or test-time data purification.

      <title>TopER: Topological Embeddings in Graph Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph embeddings play a critical role in graph representation learning, allowing machine learning models to explore and interpret graph-structured data. However, existing methods often rely on opaque, high-dimensional embeddings, limiting interpretability and practical visualization.
  In this work, we introduce Topological Evolution Rate (TopER), a novel, low-dimensional embedding approach grounded in topological data analysis. TopER simplifies a key topological approach, Persistent Homology, by calculating the evolution rate of graph substructures, resulting in intuitive and interpretable visualizations of graph data. This approach not only enhances the exploration of graph datasets but also delivers competitive performance in graph clustering and classification tasks. Our TopER-based models achieve or surpass state-of-the-art results across molecular, biological, and social network datasets in tasks such as classification, clustering, and visualization.</description>

Abstract: Neural-symbolic computing (NeSy), which pursues the integration of the symbolic and statistical paradigms of cognition, has been an active research area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for many years. As NeSy shows promise of reconciling the advantages of reasoning and interpretability of symbolic representation and robust learning in neural networks, it may serve as a catalyst for the next generation of AI. In the present paper, we provide a systematic overview of the recent developments and important contributions of NeSy research. Firstly, we introduce study history of this area, covering early work and foundations. We further discuss background concepts and identify key driving factors behind the development of NeSy. Afterward, we categorize recent landmark approaches along several main characteristics that underline this research paradigm, including neural-symbolic integration, knowledge representation, knowledge embedding, and functionality. Next, we briefly discuss the successful application of modern NeSy approaches in several domains. Then, we benchmark several NeSy methods on three representative application tasks. Finally, we identify the open problems together with potential future research directions. This survey is expected to help new researchers enter this rapidly evolving field and accelerate the progress towards data-and knowledge-driven AI.</description>

      <title>TACOS: Topology-Aware Collective Algorithm Synthesizer for Distributed Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surge of artificial intelligence, particularly large language models, has driven the rapid development of large-scale machine learning clusters. Executing distributed models on these clusters is often constrained by communication overhead, making efficient utilization of available network resources crucial. As a result, the routing algorithm employed for collective communications (i.e., collective algorithms) plays a pivotal role in determining overall performance. Unfortunately, existing collective communication libraries for distributed machine learning are limited by a fixed set of basic collective algorithms. This limitation hinders communication optimization, especially in modern clusters with heterogeneous and asymmetric topologies. Furthermore, manually designing collective algorithms for all possible combinations of network topologies and collective patterns requires heavy engineering and validation efforts. To address these challenges, this paper presents TACOS, an autonomous synthesizer capable of automatically generating topology-aware collective algorithms tailored to specific collective patterns and network topologies. TACOS is highly flexible, synthesizing an All-Reduce algorithm for a heterogeneous 128-NPU system in just 1.08 seconds, while achieving up to a 4.27x performance improvement over state-of-the-art synthesizers. Additionally, TACOS demonstrates better scalability with polynomial synthesis times, in contrast to NP-hard approaches which only scale to systems with tens of NPUs. TACOS can synthesize for 40K NPUs in just 2.52 hours.</description>

      <title>LongForm: Effective Instruction Tuning with Reverse Instructions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruction tuning enables language models to more effectively generalize and better follow user intent. However, obtaining instruction data is costly and challenging. Prior work employs methods such as expensive human annotation, crowd-sourced datasets with alignment issues, and generating noisy examples via LLMs. We introduce the LongForm-C dataset, which is created by reverse instructions. We generate instructions via LLMs for human-written corpus examples using reverse instructions. First we select a diverse set of human-written documents from corpora such as C4 and Wikipedia; then we generate instructions for these documents via LLMs. This approach provides a cheaper and cleaner instruction-tuning dataset with natural output and one suitable for long text generation. Our models outperform 10x larger language models without instruction tuning on tasks such as story/recipe generation and long-form question answering. Moreover, LongForm models outperform prior instruction-tuned models such as FLAN-T5 and Alpaca by a large margin, and improve language understanding capabilities further. We publicly release our data and models: https://github.com/akoksal/LongForm.</description>

      <title>Optimal Projections for Discriminative Dictionary Learning using the JL-lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13991v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction-based dictionary learning methods in the literature have often used iterative random projections. The dimensionality of such a random projection matrix is a random number that might not lead to a separable subspace structure in the transformed space. The convergence of such methods highly depends on the initial seed values used. Also, gradient descent-based updates might result in local minima. This paper proposes a constructive approach to derandomize the projection matrix using the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma. Rather than reducing dimensionality via random projections, a projection matrix derived from the proposed Modified Supervised PC analysis is used. A heuristic is proposed to decide the data perturbation levels and the dictionary atom's corresponding suitable description length. The projection matrix is derived in a single step, provides maximum feature-label consistency of the transformed space, and preserves the geometry of the original data. The projection matrix thus constructed is proved to be a JL-embedding. Despite confusing classes in the OCR datasets, the dictionary trained in the transformed space generates discriminative sparse coefficients with reduced complexity. Empirical study demonstrates that the proposed method performs well even when the number of classes and dimensionality increase. Experimentation on OCR and face recognition datasets shows better classification performance than other algorithms.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Foundation Priors: Let the Embodied Agent Efficiently Learn on Its Own</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach for solving robotic manipulation tasks. However, it is challenging to apply the RL algorithms directly in the real world. For one thing, RL is data-intensive and typically requires millions of interactions with environments, which are impractical in real scenarios. For another, it is necessary to make heavy engineering efforts to design reward functions manually. To address these issues, we leverage foundation models in this paper. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Foundation Priors (RLFP) to utilize guidance and feedback from policy, value, and success-reward foundation models. Within this framework, we introduce the Foundation-guided Actor-Critic (FAC) algorithm, which enables embodied agents to explore more efficiently with automatic reward functions. The benefits of our framework are threefold: (1) \textit{sample efficient}; (2) \textit{minimal and effective reward engineering}; (3) \textit{agnostic to foundation model forms and robust to noisy priors}. Our method achieves remarkable performances in various manipulation tasks on both real robots and in simulation. Across 5 dexterous tasks with real robots, FAC achieves an average success rate of 86\% after one hour of real-time learning. Across 8 tasks in the simulated Meta-world, FAC achieves 100\% success rates in 7/8 tasks under less than 100k frames (about 1-hour training), outperforming baseline methods with manual-designed rewards in 1M frames. We believe the RLFP framework can enable future robots to explore and learn autonomously in the physical world for more tasks.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Medical Image Representations via Quaternion Wavelet Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10224v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural network generalizability is becoming a broad research field due to the increasing availability of datasets from different sources and for various tasks. This issue is even wider when processing medical data, where a lack of methodological standards causes large variations being provided by different imaging centers or acquired with various devices and cofactors. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel, generalizable, data- and task-agnostic framework able to extract salient features from medical images. The proposed quaternion wavelet network (QUAVE) can be easily integrated with any pre-existing medical image analysis or synthesis task, and it can be involved with real, quaternion, or hypercomplex-valued models, generalizing their adoption to single-channel data. QUAVE first extracts different sub-bands through the quaternion wavelet transform, resulting in both low-frequency/approximation bands and high-frequency/fine-grained features. Then, it weighs the most representative set of sub-bands to be involved as input to any other neural model for image processing, replacing standard data samples. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation comprising different datasets, diverse image analysis, and synthesis tasks including reconstruction, segmentation, and modality translation. We also evaluate QUAVE in combination with both real and quaternion-valued models. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and the generalizability of the proposed framework that improves network performance while being flexible to be adopted in manifold scenarios and robust to domain shifts.

      <title>Semantic-Aware Adversarial Training for Reliable Deep Hashing Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep hashing has been intensively studied and successfully applied in large-scale image retrieval systems due to its efficiency and effectiveness. Recent studies have recognized that the existence of adversarial examples poses a security threat to deep hashing models, that is, adversarial vulnerability. Notably, it is challenging to efficiently distill reliable semantic representatives for deep hashing to guide adversarial learning, and thereby it hinders the enhancement of adversarial robustness of deep hashing-based retrieval models. Moreover, current researches on adversarial training for deep hashing are hard to be formalized into a unified minimax structure. In this paper, we explore Semantic-Aware Adversarial Training (SAAT) for improving the adversarial robustness of deep hashing models. Specifically, we conceive a discriminative mainstay features learning (DMFL) scheme to construct semantic representatives for guiding adversarial learning in deep hashing. Particularly, our DMFL with the strict theoretical guarantee is adaptively optimized in a discriminative learning manner, where both discriminative and semantic properties are jointly considered. Moreover, adversarial examples are fabricated by maximizing the Hamming distance between the hash codes of adversarial samples and mainstay features, the efficacy of which is validated in the adversarial attack trials. Further, we, for the first time, formulate the formalized adversarial training of deep hashing into a unified minimax optimization under the guidance of the generated mainstay codes. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show superb attack performance against the state-of-the-art algorithms, meanwhile, the proposed adversarial training can effectively eliminate adversarial perturbations for trustworthy deep hashing-based retrieval.

      <title>Algorithms for Non-Negative Matrix Factorization on Noisy Data With Negative Values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04855v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a dimensionality reduction technique that has shown promise for analyzing noisy data, especially astronomical data. For these datasets, the observed data may contain negative values due to noise even when the true underlying physical signal is strictly positive. Prior NMF work has not treated negative data in a statistically consistent manner, which becomes problematic for low signal-to-noise data with many negative values. In this paper we present two algorithms, Shift-NMF and Nearly-NMF, that can handle both the noisiness of the input data and also any introduced negativity. Both of these algorithms use the negative data space without clipping, and correctly recover non-negative signals without any introduced positive offset that occurs when clipping negative data. We demonstrate this numerically on both simple and more realistic examples, and prove that both algorithms have monotonically decreasing update rules.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models on Graphs: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT4 and LLaMA, are creating significant advancements in natural language processing, due to their strong text encoding/decoding ability and newly found emergent capability (e.g., reasoning). While LLMs are mainly designed to process pure texts, there are many real-world scenarios where text data is associated with rich structure information in the form of graphs (e.g., academic networks, and e-commerce networks) or scenarios where graph data is paired with rich textual information (e.g., molecules with descriptions). Besides, although LLMs have shown their pure text-based reasoning ability, it is underexplored whether such ability can be generalized to graphs (i.e., graph-based reasoning). In this paper, we provide a systematic review of scenarios and techniques related to large language models on graphs. We first summarize potential scenarios of adopting LLMs on graphs into three categories, namely pure graphs, text-attributed graphs, and text-paired graphs. We then discuss detailed techniques for utilizing LLMs on graphs, including LLM as Predictor, LLM as Encoder, and LLM as Aligner, and compare the advantages and disadvantages of different schools of models. Furthermore, we discuss the real-world applications of such methods and summarize open-source codes and benchmark datasets. Finally, we conclude with potential future research directions in this fast-growing field.

      <title>Machine learning a fixed point action for SU(3) gauge theory with a gauge equivariant convolutional neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fixed point lattice actions are designed to have continuum classical properties unaffected by discretization effects and reduced lattice artifacts at the quantum level. They provide a possible way to extract continuum physics with coarser lattices, thereby allowing one to circumvent problems with critical slowing down and topological freezing toward the continuum limit. A crucial ingredient for practical applications is to find an accurate and compact parametrization of a fixed point action, since many of its properties are only implicitly defined. Here we use machine learning methods to revisit the question of how to parametrize fixed point actions. In particular, we obtain a fixed point action for four-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory using convolutional neural networks with exact gauge invariance. The large operator space allows us to find superior parametrizations compared to previous studies, a necessary first step for future Monte Carlo simulations and scaling studies.</description>

      <title>Solution of the Probabilistic Lambert Problem: Connections with Optimal Mass Transport, Schr\"odinger Bridge and Reaction-Diffusion PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07961v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lambert problem originated in orbital mechanics. It concerns with determining the initial velocity for a boundary value problem involving the dynamical constraint due to gravitational potential with additional time horizon and endpoint position constraints. Its solution has application in transferring a spacecraft from a given initial to a given terminal position within prescribed flight time via velocity control. We consider a probabilistic variant of the Lambert problem where the knowledge of the endpoint constraints in position vectors are replaced by the knowledge of their respective joint probability density functions. We show that the Lambert problem with endpoint joint probability density constraints is a generalized optimal mass transport (OMT) problem, thereby connecting this classical astrodynamics problem with a burgeoning area of research in modern stochastic control and stochastic machine learning. This newfound connection allows us to rigorously establish the existence and uniqueness of solution for the probabilistic Lambert problem. The same connection also helps to numerically solve the probabilistic Lambert problem via diffusion regularization, i.e., by leveraging further connection of the OMT with the Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SBP). This also shows that the probabilistic Lambert problem with additive dynamic process noise is a generalized SBP, and can be solved numerically using the so-called Schr\"odinger factors, as we do in this work. Our analysis leads to solving a system of reaction-diffusion PDEs where the gravitational potential appears as the reaction rate.</description>

      <title>The Instinctive Bias: Spurious Images lead to Illusion in MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently experienced remarkable progress, where the advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has endowed LLMs with visual capabilities, leading to impressive performances in various multi-modal tasks. However, those powerful MLLMs such as GPT-4V still fail spectacularly when presented with certain image and text inputs. In this paper, we identify a typical class of inputs that baffles MLLMs, which consist of images that are highly relevant but inconsistent with answers, causing MLLMs to suffer from visual illusion. To quantify the effect, we propose CorrelationQA, the first benchmark that assesses the visual illusion level given spurious images. This benchmark contains 7,308 text-image pairs across 13 categories. Based on the proposed CorrelationQA, we conduct a thorough analysis on 9 mainstream MLLMs, illustrating that they universally suffer from this instinctive bias to varying degrees. We hope that our curated benchmark and evaluation results aid in better assessments of the MLLMs' robustness in the presence of misleading images. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/MasaiahHan/CorrelationQA.</description>

      <title>CataractBot: An LLM-Powered Expert-in-the-Loop Chatbot for Cataract Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The healthcare landscape is evolving, with patients seeking reliable information about their health conditions and available treatment options. Despite the abundance of information sources, the digital age overwhelms individuals with excess, often inaccurate information. Patients primarily trust medical professionals, highlighting the need for expert-endorsed health information. However, increased patient loads on experts has led to reduced communication time, impacting information sharing. To address this gap, we develop CataractBot, an experts-in-the-loop chatbot powered by LLMs, in collaboration with an eye hospital in India. CataractBot answers cataract surgery related questions instantly by querying a curated knowledge base, and provides expert-verified responses asynchronously. It has multimodal and multilingual capabilities. In an in-the-wild deployment study with 55 participants, CataractBot proved valuable, providing anytime accessibility, saving time, accommodating diverse literacy levels, alleviating power differences, and adding a privacy layer between patients and doctors. Users reported that their trust in the system was established through expert verification. Broadly, our results could inform future work on designing expert-mediated LLM bots.</description>

      <title>Short-Period Variables in TESS Full-Frame Image Light Curves Identified via Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission measured light from stars in ~85% of the sky throughout its two-year primary mission, resulting in millions of TESS 30-minute cadence light curves to analyze in the search for transiting exoplanets. To search this vast dataset, we aim to provide an approach that is both computationally efficient, produces highly performant predictions, and minimizes the required human search effort. We present a convolutional neural network that we train to identify short period variables. To make a prediction for a given light curve, our network requires no prior target parameters identified using other methods. Our network performs inference on a TESS 30-minute cadence light curve in ~5ms on a single GPU, enabling large scale archival searches. We present a collection of 14156 short-period variables identified by our network. The majority of our identified variables fall into two prominent populations, one of short-period main sequence binaries and another of Delta Scuti stars. Our neural network model and related code is additionally provided as open-source code for public use and extension.</description>

      <title>On Sensitivity of Learning with Limited Labelled Data to the Effects of Randomness: Impact of Interactions and Systematic Choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While learning with limited labelled data can improve performance when the labels are lacking, it is also sensitive to the effects of uncontrolled randomness introduced by so-called randomness factors (e.g., varying order of data). We propose a method to systematically investigate the effects of randomness factors while taking the interactions between them into consideration. To measure the true effects of an individual randomness factor, our method mitigates the effects of other factors and observes how the performance varies across multiple runs. Applying our method to multiple randomness factors across in-context learning and fine-tuning approaches on 7 representative text classification tasks and meta-learning on 3 tasks, we show that: 1) disregarding interactions between randomness factors in existing works caused inconsistent findings due to incorrect attribution of the effects of randomness factors, such as disproving the consistent sensitivity of in-context learning to sample order even with random sample selection; and 2) besides mutual interactions, the effects of randomness factors, especially sample order, are also dependent on more systematic choices unexplored in existing works, such as number of classes, samples per class or choice of prompt format.</description>

      <title>Signature Isolation Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functional Isolation Forest (FIF) is a recent state-of-the-art Anomaly Detection (AD) algorithm designed for functional data. It relies on a tree partition procedure where an abnormality score is computed by projecting each curve observation on a drawn dictionary through a linear inner product. Such linear inner product and the dictionary are a priori choices that highly influence the algorithm's performances and might lead to unreliable results, particularly with complex datasets. This work addresses these challenges by introducing \textit{Signature Isolation Forest}, a novel AD algorithm class leveraging the rough path theory's signature transform. Our objective is to remove the constraints imposed by FIF through the proposition of two algorithms which specifically target the linearity of the FIF inner product and the choice of the dictionary. We provide several numerical experiments, including a real-world applications benchmark showing the relevance of our methods.</description>

      <title>PARAMANU-AYN: Pretrain from scratch or Continual Pretraining of LLMs for Legal Domain Adaptation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Paramanu-Ayn, a collection of legal language models trained exclusively on Indian legal case documents. This 97-million-parameter Auto-Regressive (AR) decoder-only model was pretrained from scratch with a context size of 8192 on a single GPU for just 185 hours, achieving an efficient MFU of 41.35. We also developed a legal domain specialized BPE tokenizer. We evaluated our model using perplexity and zero-shot tasks: case judgment prediction with explanation and abstractive case summarization. Paramanu-Ayn outperformed Llama-2 7B and Gemini-Pro in case judgment prediction with explanation task on test accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points, despite being 72 times smaller. In zero-shot abstractive summarization, it surpassed decoder-only LLMs generating fixed-length summaries (5000 tokens) by over 10 percentage points in BLEU and METEOR metrics, and by nearly 4 percentage points in BERTScore. Further evaluations on zero-shot commonsense and mathematical benchmarks showed that Paramanu-Ayn excelled despite being trained exclusively on legal documents, outperforming Llama-1, Llama-2, and Falcon on AGIEVAL-AQuA-RAT and AGIEVAL-SAT-Math tasks. We also instruction-tuned our model on 10,763 diverse legal tasks, including legal clause generation, legal drafting, case summarization, etc. The Paramanu-Ayn-instruct model scored above 8 out of 10 in clarity, relevance, completeness, and legal reasoning metrics by GPT-3.5-Turbo. We found that our models, were able to learn drafting knowledge and generalize to draft legal contracts and legal clauses with limited instruction-tuning. Hence, we conclude that for a strong domain-specialized generative language model (such as legal), domain specialized pretraining from scratch is more cost effective, environmentally friendly, and remains competitive with larger models or even better than adapting LLMs for legal domain tasks.</description>

      <title>A Causal Bayesian Network and Probabilistic Programming Based Reasoning Framework for Robot Manipulation Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robot object manipulation in real-world environments is challenging because robot operation must be robust to a range of sensing, estimation, and actuation uncertainties to avoid potentially unsafe and costly mistakes that are a barrier to their adoption. In this paper, we propose a flexible and generalisable physics-informed causal Bayesian network (CBN) based framework for a robot to probabilistically reason about candidate manipulation actions, to enable robot decision-making robust to arbitrary robot system uncertainties -- the first of its kind to use a probabilistic programming language implementation. Using experiments in high-fidelity Gazebo simulation of an exemplar block stacking task, we demonstrate our framework's ability to: (1) predict manipulation outcomes with high accuracy (Pred Acc: 88.6%); and, (2) perform greedy next-best action selection with 94.2% task success rate. We also demonstrate our framework's suitability for real-world robot systems with a domestic robot. Thus, we show that by combining probabilistic causal modelling with physics simulations, we can make robot manipulation more robust to system uncertainties and hence more feasible for real-world applications. Further, our generalised reasoning framework can be used and extended for future robotics and causality research.</description>

      <title>CMP: Cooperative Motion Prediction with Multi-Agent Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The confluence of the advancement of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and the maturity of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication has enabled the capability of cooperative connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Building on top of cooperative perception, this paper explores the feasibility and effectiveness of cooperative motion prediction. Our method, CMP, takes LiDAR signals as model input to enhance tracking and prediction capabilities. Unlike previous work that focuses separately on either cooperative perception or motion prediction, our framework, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to address the unified problem where CAVs share information in both perception and prediction modules. Incorporated into our design is the unique capability to tolerate realistic V2X bandwidth limitations and transmission delays, while dealing with bulky perception representations. We also propose a prediction aggregation module, which unifies the predictions obtained by different CAVs and generates the final prediction. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies on the OPV2V and V2V4Real datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in cooperative perception, tracking, and motion prediction. In particular, CMP reduces the average prediction error by 16.4\% with fewer missing detections compared with the no cooperation setting and by 12.3\% compared with the strongest baseline. Our work marks a significant step forward in the cooperative capabilities of CAVs, showcasing enhanced performance in complex scenarios. The code can be found on the project website: https://cmp-cooperative-prediction.github.io/.</description>

Abstract: Individuality and personalization comprise the distinctive characteristics that make each writer unique and influence their words in order to effectively engage readers while conveying authenticity. However, our growing reliance on LLM-based writing assistants risks compromising our creativity and individuality over time. We often overlook the negative impacts of this trend on our creativity and uniqueness, despite the possible consequences. This study investigates these concerns by performing a brief survey to explore different perspectives and concepts, as well as trying to understand people's viewpoints, in conjunction with past studies in the area. Addressing these issues is essential for improving human-computer interaction systems and enhancing writing assistants for personalization and individuality.</description>

      <title>LLMs as Writing Assistants: Exploring Perspectives on Sense of Ownership and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00027v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sense of ownership in writing confines our investment of thoughts, time, and contribution, leading to attachment to the output. However, using writing assistants introduces a mental dilemma, as some content isn't directly our creation. For instance, we tend to credit Large Language Models (LLMs) more in creative tasks, even though all tasks are equal for them. Additionally, while we may not claim complete ownership of LLM-generated content, we freely claim authorship. We conduct a short survey to examine these issues and understand underlying cognitive processes in order to gain a better knowledge of human-computer interaction in writing and improve writing aid systems.</description>

      <title>Bias Amplification in Language Model Evolution: An Iterated Learning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), the prevalence of iterative interactions among these models is anticipated to increase. Notably, recent advancements in multi-round self-improving methods allow LLMs to generate new examples for training subsequent models. At the same time, multi-agent LLM systems, involving automated interactions among agents, are also increasing in prominence. Thus, in both short and long terms, LLMs may actively engage in an evolutionary process. We draw parallels between the behavior of LLMs and the evolution of human culture, as the latter has been extensively studied by cognitive scientists for decades. Our approach involves leveraging Iterated Learning (IL), a Bayesian framework that elucidates how subtle biases are magnified during human cultural evolution, to explain some behaviors of LLMs. This paper outlines key characteristics of agents' behavior in the Bayesian-IL framework, including predictions that are supported by experimental verification with various LLMs. This theoretical framework could help to more effectively predict and guide the evolution of LLMs in desired directions.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we model the Indian stock market as heterogenous scale free network, which is then embedded in a two dimensional hyperbolic space through a machine learning based technique called as coalescent embedding. This allows us to apply the hyperbolic kmeans algorithm on the Poincare disc and the clusters so obtained resemble the original network communities more closely than the clusters obtained via Euclidean kmeans on the basis of well-known measures normalised mutual information and adjusted mutual information. Through this, we are able to clearly distinguish between periods of market stability and volatility by applying non-parametric statistical tests with a significance level of 0.05 to geometric measures namely hyperbolic distance and hyperbolic shortest path distance. After that, we are able to spot significant market change early by leveraging the Bollinger Band analysis on the time series of modularity in the embedded networks of each window. Finally, the radial distance and the Equidistance Angular coordinates help in visualizing the embedded network in the Poincare disc and it is seen that specific market sectors cluster together.</description>

      <title>Graph Chain-of-Thought: Augmenting Large Language Models by Reasoning on Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), while exhibiting exceptional performance, suffer from hallucinations, especially on knowledge-intensive tasks. Existing works propose to augment LLMs with individual text units retrieved from external knowledge corpora to alleviate the issue. However, in many domains, texts are interconnected (e.g., academic papers in a bibliographic graph are linked by citations and co-authorships) which form a (text-attributed) graph. The knowledge in such graphs is encoded not only in single texts/nodes but also in their associated connections. To facilitate the research of augmenting LLMs with graphs, we manually construct a Graph Reasoning Benchmark dataset called GRBench, containing 1,740 questions that can be answered with the knowledge from 10 domain graphs. Then, we propose a simple and effective framework called Graph Chain-of-thought (Graph-CoT) to augment LLMs with graphs by encouraging LLMs to reason on the graph iteratively. Each Graph-CoT iteration consists of three sub-steps: LLM reasoning, LLM-graph interaction, and graph execution. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on GRBench, where Graph-CoT outperforms the baselines consistently. The code is available at https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/Graph-CoT.</description>

      <title>On Training Data Influence of GPT Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amidst the rapid advancements in generative language models, the investigation of how training data shapes the performance of GPT models is still emerging. This paper presents GPTfluence, a novel approach that leverages a featurized simulation to assess the impact of training examples on the training dynamics of GPT models. Our approach not only traces the influence of individual training instances on performance trajectories, such as loss and other key metrics, on targeted test points but also enables a comprehensive comparison with existing methods across various training scenarios in GPT models, ranging from 14 million to 2.8 billion parameters, across a range of downstream tasks. Contrary to earlier methods that struggle with generalization to new data, GPTfluence introduces a parameterized simulation of training dynamics, demonstrating robust generalization capabilities to unseen training data. This adaptability is evident across both fine-tuning and instruction-tuning scenarios, spanning tasks in natural language understanding and generation. We make our code and data publicly available at https://github.com/ernie-research/gptfluence.</description>

      <title>AI-Generated Faces in the Real World: A Large-Scale Case Study of Twitter Profile Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14244v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI) have blurred the lines between authentic and machine-generated content, making it almost impossible for humans to distinguish between such media. One notable consequence is the use of AI-generated images for fake profiles on social media. While several types of disinformation campaigns and similar incidents have been reported in the past, a systematic analysis has been lacking. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale investigation of the prevalence of AI-generated profile pictures on Twitter. We tackle the challenges of a real-world measurement study by carefully integrating various data sources and designing a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our analysis of nearly 15 million Twitter profile pictures shows that 0.052% were artificially generated, confirming their notable presence on the platform. We comprehensively examine the characteristics of these accounts and their tweet content, and uncover patterns of coordinated inauthentic behavior. The results also reveal several motives, including spamming and political amplification campaigns. Our research reaffirms the need for effective detection and mitigation strategies to cope with the potential negative effects of generative AI in the future.</description>

      <title>Source-Free Domain Adaptation Guided by Vision and Vision-Language Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02954v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a source model trained on a fully-labeled source domain to a related but unlabeled target domain. While the source model is a key avenue for acquiring target pseudolabels, the generated pseudolabels may exhibit source bias. In the conventional SFDA pipeline, a large data (e.g. ImageNet) pre-trained feature extractor is used to initialize the source model at the start of source training, and subsequently discarded. Despite having diverse features important for generalization, the pre-trained feature extractor can overfit to the source data distribution during source training and forget relevant target domain knowledge. Rather than discarding this valuable knowledge, we introduce an integrated framework to incorporate pre-trained networks into the target adaptation process. The proposed framework is flexible and allows us to plug modern pre-trained networks into the adaptation process to leverage their stronger representation learning capabilities. For adaptation, we propose the Co-learn algorithm to improve target pseudolabel quality collaboratively through the source model and a pre-trained feature extractor. Building on the recent success of the vision-language model CLIP in zero-shot image recognition, we present an extension Co-learn++ to further incorporate CLIP's zero-shot classification decisions. We evaluate on 4 benchmark datasets and include more challenging scenarios such as open-set, partial-set and open-partial SFDA. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed strategy improves adaptation performance and can be successfully integrated with existing SFDA methods.

      <title>ScenicNL: Generating Probabilistic Scenario Programs from Natural Language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For cyber-physical systems (CPS), including robotics and autonomous vehicles, mass deployment has been hindered by fatal errors that occur when operating in rare events. To replicate rare events such as vehicle crashes, many companies have created logging systems and employed crash reconstruction experts to meticulously recreate these valuable events in simulation. However, in these methods, "what if" questions are not easily formulated and answered. We present ScenarioNL, an AI System for creating scenario programs from natural language. Specifically, we generate these programs from police crash reports. Reports normally contain uncertainty about the exact details of the incidents which we represent through a Probabilistic Programming Language (PPL), Scenic. By using Scenic, we can clearly and concisely represent uncertainty and variation over CPS behaviors, properties, and interactions. We demonstrate how commonplace prompting techniques with the best Large Language Models (LLM) are incapable of reasoning about probabilistic scenario programs and generating code for low-resource languages such as Scenic. Our system is comprised of several LLMs chained together with several kinds of prompting strategies, a compiler, and a simulator. We evaluate our system on publicly available autonomous vehicle crash reports in California from the last five years and share insights into how we generate code that is both semantically meaningful and syntactically correct.</description>

      <title>Variance-Reducing Couplings for Random Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random features (RFs) are a popular technique to scale up kernel methods in machine learning, replacing exact kernel evaluations with stochastic Monte Carlo estimates. They underpin models as diverse as efficient transformers (by approximating attention) to sparse spectrum Gaussian processes (by approximating the covariance function). Efficiency can be further improved by speeding up the convergence of these estimates: a variance reduction problem. We tackle this through the unifying lens of optimal transport, finding couplings to improve RFs defined on both Euclidean and discrete input spaces. They enjoy theoretical guarantees and sometimes provide strong downstream gains, including for scalable approximate inference on graphs. We reach surprising conclusions about the benefits and limitations of variance reduction as a paradigm, showing that other properties of the coupling should be optimised for attention estimation in efficient transformers.</description>

      <title>Spectral Truncation Kernels: Noncommutativity in $C^*$-algebraic Kernel Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17823v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $C^*$-algebra-valued kernels could pave the way for the next generation of kernel machines. To further our fundamental understanding of learning with $C^*$-algebraic kernels, we propose a new class of positive definite kernels based on the spectral truncation. We focus on kernels whose inputs and outputs are vectors or functions and generalize typical kernels by introducing the noncommutativity of the products appearing in the kernels. The noncommutativity induces interactions along the data function domain. We show that it is a governing factor leading to performance enhancement: we can balance the representation power and the model complexity. We also propose a deep learning perspective to increase the representation capacity of spectral truncation kernels. The flexibility of the proposed class of kernels allows us to go beyond previous commutative kernels, addressing two of the foremost issues regarding learning in vector-valued RKHSs, namely the choice of the kernel and the computational cost.</description>

      <title>PromptWizard: Task-Aware Prompt Optimization Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed AI across diverse domains, with prompting being central to their success in guiding model outputs. However, manual prompt engineering is both labor-intensive and domain-specific, necessitating the need for automated solutions. We introduce PromptWizard, a novel, fully automated framework for discrete prompt optimization, utilizing a self-evolving, self-adapting mechanism. Through a feedback-driven critique and synthesis process, PromptWizard achieves an effective balance between exploration and exploitation, iteratively refining both prompt instructions and in-context examples to generate human-readable, task-specific prompts. This guided approach systematically improves prompt quality, resulting in superior performance across 45 tasks. PromptWizard excels even with limited training data, smaller LLMs, and various LLM architectures. Additionally, our cost analysis reveals a substantial reduction in API calls, token usage, and overall cost, demonstrating PromptWizard's efficiency, scalability, and advantages over existing prompt optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap3D: Improving Multi-view Diffusion Model with Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in multi-view diffusion models for 3D content creation. However, there remains a significant gap in image quality and prompt-following ability compared to 2D diffusion models. A critical bottleneck is the scarcity of high-quality 3D objects with detailed captions. To address this challenge, we propose Bootstrap3D, a novel framework that automatically generates an arbitrary quantity of multi-view images to assist in training multi-view diffusion models. Specifically, we introduce a data generation pipeline that employs (1) 2D and video diffusion models to generate multi-view images based on constructed text prompts, and (2) our fine-tuned 3D-aware MV-LLaVA for filtering high-quality data and rewriting inaccurate captions. Leveraging this pipeline, we have generated 1 million high-quality synthetic multi-view images with dense descriptive captions to address the shortage of high-quality 3D data. Furthermore, we present a Training Timestep Reschedule (TTR) strategy that leverages the denoising process to learn multi-view consistency while maintaining the original 2D diffusion prior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Bootstrap3D can generate high-quality multi-view images with superior aesthetic quality, image-text alignment, and maintained view consistency.</description>

      <title>Fair Allocation in Dynamic Mechanism Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00147v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a dynamic mechanism design problem where an auctioneer sells an indivisible good to groups of buyers in every round, for a total of $T$ rounds. The auctioneer aims to maximize their discounted overall revenue while adhering to a fairness constraint that guarantees a minimum average allocation for each group. We begin by studying the static case ($T=1$) and establish that the optimal mechanism involves two types of subsidization: one that increases the overall probability of allocation to all buyers, and another that favors the groups which otherwise have a lower probability of winning the item. We then extend our results to the dynamic case by characterizing a set of recursive functions that determine the optimal allocation and payments in each round. Notably, our results establish that in the dynamic case, the seller, on the one hand, commits to a participation bonus to incentivize truth-telling, and on the other hand, charges an entry fee for every round. Moreover, the optimal allocation once more involves subsidization, which its extent depends on the difference in future utilities for both the seller and buyers when allocating the item to one group versus the others. Finally, we present an approximation scheme to solve the recursive equations and determine an approximately optimal and fair allocation efficiently.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Preconditioners for Iterative Solutions of Sparse Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preconditioning is at the heart of iterative solutions of large, sparse linear systems of equations in scientific disciplines. Several algebraic approaches, which access no information beyond the matrix itself, are widely studied and used, but ill-conditioned matrices remain very challenging. We take a machine learning approach and propose using graph neural networks as a general-purpose preconditioner. They show attractive performance for many problems and can be used when the mainstream preconditioners perform poorly. Empirical evaluation on over 800 matrices suggests that the construction time of these graph neural preconditioners (GNPs) is more predictable and can be much shorter than that of other widely used ones, such as ILU and AMG, while the execution time is faster than using a Krylov method as the preconditioner, such as in inner-outer GMRES. GNPs have a strong potential for solving large-scale, challenging algebraic problems arising from not only partial differential equations, but also economics, statistics, graph, and optimization, to name a few.</description>

      <title>VideoPhy: Evaluating Physical Commonsense for Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in internet-scale video data pretraining have led to the development of text-to-video generative models that can create high-quality videos across a broad range of visual concepts, synthesize realistic motions and render complex objects. Hence, these generative models have the potential to become general-purpose simulators of the physical world. However, it is unclear how far we are from this goal with the existing text-to-video generative models. To this end, we present VideoPhy, a benchmark designed to assess whether the generated videos follow physical commonsense for real-world activities (e.g. marbles will roll down when placed on a slanted surface). Specifically, we curate diverse prompts that involve interactions between various material types in the physical world (e.g., solid-solid, solid-fluid, fluid-fluid). We then generate videos conditioned on these captions from diverse state-of-the-art text-to-video generative models, including open models (e.g., CogVideoX) and closed models (e.g., Lumiere, Dream Machine). Our human evaluation reveals that the existing models severely lack the ability to generate videos adhering to the given text prompts, while also lack physical commonsense. Specifically, the best performing model, CogVideoX-5B, generates videos that adhere to the caption and physical laws for 39.6% of the instances. VideoPhy thus highlights that the video generative models are far from accurately simulating the physical world. Finally, we propose an auto-evaluator, VideoCon-Physics, to assess the performance reliably for the newly released models.</description>

      <title>MeanSparse: Post-Training Robustness Enhancement Through Mean-Centered Feature Sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple yet effective method to improve the robustness of both Convolutional and attention-based Neural Networks against adversarial examples by post-processing an adversarially trained model. Our technique, MeanSparse, cascades the activation functions of a trained model with novel operators that sparsify mean-centered feature vectors. This is equivalent to reducing feature variations around the mean, and we show that such reduced variations merely affect the model's utility, yet they strongly attenuate the adversarial perturbations and decrease the attacker's success rate. Our experiments show that, when applied to the top models in the RobustBench leaderboard, MeanSparse achieves a new robustness record of 75.28% (from 73.71%), 44.78% (from 42.67%) and 62.12% (from 59.56%) on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, respectively, in terms of AutoAttack accuracy.

Abstract: Group equivariant convolutional neural networks have been designed for a variety of geometric transformations from 2D and 3D rotation groups, to semi-groups such as scale. Despite the improved interpretability, accuracy and generalizability afforded by these architectures, group equivariant networks have seen limited application in the context of perceptual quantities such as hue and saturation, even though their variation can lead to significant reductions in classification performance. In this paper, we introduce convolutional neural networks equivariant to variations in hue and saturation by design. To achieve this, we leverage the observation that hue and saturation transformations can be identified with the 2D rotation and 1D translation groups respectively. Our hue-, saturation-, and fully color-equivariant networks achieve equivariance to these perceptual transformations without an increase in network parameters. We demonstrate the utility of our networks on synthetic and real world datasets where color and lighting variations are commonplace.</description>

      <title>CryoSPIN: Improving Ab-Initio Cryo-EM Reconstruction with Semi-Amortized Pose Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cryo-EM is an increasingly popular method for determining the atomic resolution 3D structure of macromolecular complexes (eg, proteins) from noisy 2D images captured by an electron microscope. The computational task is to reconstruct the 3D density of the particle, along with 3D pose of the particle in each 2D image, for which the posterior pose distribution is highly multi-modal. Recent developments in cryo-EM have focused on deep learning for which amortized inference has been used to predict pose. Here, we address key problems with this approach, and propose a new semi-amortized method, cryoSPIN, in which reconstruction begins with amortized inference and then switches to a form of auto-decoding to refine poses locally using stochastic gradient descent. Through evaluation on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that cryoSPIN is able to handle multi-modal pose distributions during the amortized inference stage, while the later, more flexible stage of direct pose optimization yields faster and more accurate convergence of poses compared to baselines. On experimental data, we show that cryoSPIN outperforms the state-of-the-art cryoAI in speed and reconstruction quality.</description>

      <title>PSLM: Parallel Generation of Text and Speech with LLMs for Low-Latency Spoken Dialogue Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal language models that process both text and speech have a potential for applications in spoken dialogue systems. However, current models face two major challenges in response generation latency: (1) generating a spoken response requires the prior generation of a written response, and (2) speech sequences are significantly longer than text sequences. This study addresses these issues by extending the input and output sequences of the language model to support the parallel generation of text and speech. Our experiments on spoken question answering tasks demonstrate that our approach improves latency while maintaining the quality of response content. Additionally, we show that latency can be further reduced by generating speech in multiple sequences. Demo samples are available at https://rinnakk.github.io/research/publications/PSLM.</description>

      <title>Model Internals-based Answer Attribution for Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the verifiability of model answers is a fundamental challenge for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in the question answering (QA) domain. Recently, self-citation prompting was proposed to make large language models (LLMs) generate citations to supporting documents along with their answers. However, self-citing LLMs often struggle to match the required format, refer to non-existent sources, and fail to faithfully reflect LLMs' context usage throughout the generation. In this work, we present MIRAGE --Model Internals-based RAG Explanations -- a plug-and-play approach using model internals for faithful answer attribution in RAG applications. MIRAGE detects context-sensitive answer tokens and pairs them with retrieved documents contributing to their prediction via saliency methods. We evaluate our proposed approach on a multilingual extractive QA dataset, finding high agreement with human answer attribution. On open-ended QA, MIRAGE achieves citation quality and efficiency comparable to self-citation while also allowing for a finer-grained control of attribution parameters. Our qualitative evaluation highlights the faithfulness of MIRAGE's attributions and underscores the promising application of model internals for RAG answer attribution.</description>

      <title>Segment Any Text: A Universal Approach for Robust, Efficient and Adaptable Sentence Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Segmenting text into sentences plays an early and crucial role in many NLP systems. This is commonly achieved by using rule-based or statistical methods relying on lexical features such as punctuation. Although some recent works no longer exclusively rely on punctuation, we find that no prior method achieves all of (i) robustness to missing punctuation, (ii) effective adaptability to new domains, and (iii) high efficiency. We introduce a new model - Segment any Text (SaT) - to solve this problem. To enhance robustness, we propose a new pretraining scheme that ensures less reliance on punctuation. To address adaptability, we introduce an extra stage of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, establishing state-of-the-art performance in distinct domains such as verses from lyrics and legal documents. Along the way, we introduce architectural modifications that result in a threefold gain in speed over the previous state of the art and solve spurious reliance on context far in the future. Finally, we introduce a variant of our model with fine-tuning on a diverse, multilingual mixture of sentence-segmented data, acting as a drop-in replacement and enhancement for existing segmentation tools. Overall, our contributions provide a universal approach for segmenting any text. Our method outperforms all baselines - including strong LLMs - across 8 corpora spanning diverse domains and languages, especially in practically relevant situations where text is poorly formatted. Our models and code, including documentation, are available at https://github.com/segment-any-text/wtpsplit under the MIT license.</description>

Abstract: When engaging in collaborative tasks, humans efficiently exploit the semantic structure of a conversation to optimize verbal and nonverbal interactions. But in recent "language to code" or "language to action" models, this information is lacking. We show how incorporating the prior discourse and nonlinguistic context of a conversation situated in a nonlinguistic environment can improve the "language to action" component of such interactions. We finetune an LLM to predict actions based on prior context; our model, Nebula, doubles the net-action F1 score over the baseline on this task of Jayannavar et al.(2020). We also investigate our model's ability to construct shapes and understand location descriptions using a synthetic dataset</description>

      <title>Token Erasure as a Footprint of Implicit Vocabulary Items in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs process text as sequences of tokens that roughly correspond to words, where less common words are represented by multiple tokens. However, individual tokens are often semantically unrelated to the meanings of the words/concepts they comprise. For example, Llama-2-7b's tokenizer splits the word "northeastern" into the tokens ['_n', 'ort', 'he', 'astern'], none of which correspond to semantically meaningful units like "north" or "east." Similarly, the overall meanings of named entities like "Neil Young" and multi-word expressions like "break a leg" cannot be directly inferred from their constituent tokens. Mechanistically, how do LLMs convert such arbitrary groups of tokens into useful higher-level representations? In this work, we find that last token representations of named entities and multi-token words exhibit a pronounced "erasure" effect, where information about previous and current tokens is rapidly forgotten in early layers. Using this observation, we propose a method to "read out" the implicit vocabulary of an autoregressive LLM by examining differences in token representations across layers, and present results of this method for Llama-2-7b and Llama-3-8B. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to probe the implicit vocabulary of an LLM.</description>

      <title>Preble: Efficient Distributed Prompt Scheduling for LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prompts to large language models (LLMs) have evolved beyond simple user questions. For LLMs to solve complex problems, today's practices are to include domain-specific instructions, illustration of tool usages, and/or long context such as textbook chapters in prompts. As such, many parts of prompts are repetitive across requests. Recent works propose to cache and reuse KV state of prompts. However, they are all confined to a single-GPU optimization, while production LLM serving systems are distributed by nature.
  This paper proposes Preble, the first distributed LLM serving platform that targets and optimizes for prompt sharing. We designed a distributed scheduling system that co-optimizes KV state reuse and computation load-balancing with a new scheduling algorithm and a hierarchical scheduling mechanism. Our evaluation of Preble with real workloads and request arrival patterns on two open-source LLMs shows that Preble outperforms the SOTA serving systems by 1.5X to 14.5X on average latency and 2X to 10X on p99 latency.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Performance Prediction for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Comprehensively understanding and accurately predicting the performance of large language models across diverse downstream tasks has emerged as a pivotal challenge in NLP research. The pioneering scaling law on downstream works demonstrated intrinsic similarities within model families and utilized such similarities for performance prediction. However, they tend to overlook the similarities between model families and only consider design factors listed in the original scaling law. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework, Collaborative Performance Prediction (CPP), which significantly enhances prediction accuracy by leveraging the historical performance of various models on downstream tasks and other design factors for both model and task. We also collect a collaborative data sourced from online platforms containing both historical performance and additional design factors. With the support of the collaborative data, CPP not only surpasses traditional scaling laws in predicting the performance of scaled LLMs but also facilitates a detailed analysis of factor importance, an area previously overlooked.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their remarkable capabilities in performing diverse tasks across various domains. However, a thorough evaluation of these models is crucial before deploying them in real-world applications to ensure they produce reliable performance. Despite the well-established importance of evaluating LLMs in the community, the complexity of the evaluation process has led to varied evaluation setups, causing inconsistencies in findings and interpretations. To address this, we systematically review the primary challenges and limitations causing these inconsistencies and unreliable evaluations in various steps of LLM evaluation. Based on our critical review, we present our perspectives and recommendations to ensure LLM evaluations are reproducible, reliable, and robust.</description>

      <title>Lookback Lens: Detecting and Mitigating Contextual Hallucinations in Large Language Models Using Only Attention Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When asked to summarize articles or answer questions given a passage, large language models (LLMs) can hallucinate details and respond with unsubstantiated answers that are inaccurate with respect to the input context. This paper describes a simple approach for detecting such contextual hallucinations. We hypothesize that contextual hallucinations are related to the extent to which an LLM attends to information in the provided context versus its own generations. Based on this intuition, we propose a simple hallucination detection model whose input features are given by the ratio of attention weights on the context versus newly generated tokens (for each attention head). We find that a linear classifier based on these lookback ratio features is as effective as a richer detector that utilizes the entire hidden states of an LLM or a text-based entailment model. The lookback ratio-based detector -- Lookback Lens -- is found to transfer across tasks and even models, allowing a detector that is trained on a 7B model to be applied (without retraining) to a larger 13B model. We further apply this detector to mitigate contextual hallucinations, and find that a simple classifier-guided decoding approach is able to reduce the amount of hallucination, for example by 9.6% in the XSum summarization task.</description>

      <title>Does Refusal Training in LLMs Generalize to the Past Tense?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Refusal training is widely used to prevent LLMs from generating harmful, undesirable, or illegal outputs. We reveal a curious generalization gap in the current refusal training approaches: simply reformulating a harmful request in the past tense (e.g., "How to make a Molotov cocktail?" to "How did people make a Molotov cocktail?") is often sufficient to jailbreak many state-of-the-art LLMs. We systematically evaluate this method on Llama-3 8B, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Gemma-2 9B, Phi-3-Mini, GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o, o1-mini, o1-preview, and R2D2 models using GPT-3.5 Turbo as a reformulation model. For example, the success rate of this simple attack on GPT-4o increases from 1% using direct requests to 88% using 20 past tense reformulation attempts on harmful requests from JailbreakBench with GPT-4 as a jailbreak judge. Interestingly, we also find that reformulations in the future tense are less effective, suggesting that refusal guardrails tend to consider past historical questions more benign than hypothetical future questions. Moreover, our experiments on fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo show that defending against past reformulations is feasible when past tense examples are explicitly included in the fine-tuning data. Overall, our findings highlight that the widely used alignment techniques -- such as SFT, RLHF, and adversarial training -- employed to align the studied models can be brittle and do not always generalize as intended. We provide code and jailbreak artifacts at https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-past-tense.</description>

      <title>Generalization v.s. Memorization: Tracing Language Models' Capabilities Back to Pretraining Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked debate over whether these models genuinely generalize to unseen tasks or predominantly rely on memorizing vast amounts of pretraining data. To explore this issue, we introduce an extended concept of memorization, distributional memorization, which measures the correlation between the LLM output probabilities and the pretraining data frequency. To effectively capture task-specific pretraining data frequency, we propose a novel task-gram language model, which is built by counting the co-occurrence of semantically related $n$-gram pairs from task inputs and outputs in the pretraining corpus. Using the Pythia models trained on the Pile dataset, we evaluate three distinct tasks: machine translation, factual question answering, and reasoning. Our findings reveal varying levels of memorization, with the strongest effect observed in factual question answering. Furthermore, while model performance improves across all tasks as LLM size increases, only factual question answering shows an increase in memorization, whereas machine translation and reasoning tasks exhibit greater generalization, producing more novel outputs. This study demonstrates that memorization plays a larger role in simpler, knowledge-intensive tasks, while generalization is the key for harder, reasoning-based tasks, providing a scalable method for analyzing large pretraining corpora in greater depth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19340v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a pervasive mental health condition that affects 300 million people worldwide. This work presents a novel, BiLSTM-based tri-modal model-level fusion architecture for the binary classification of depression from clinical interview recordings. The proposed architecture incorporates Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, Facial Action Units, and uses a two-shot learning based GPT-4 model to process text data. This is the first work to incorporate large language models into a multi-modal architecture for this task. It achieves impressive results on the DAIC-WOZ AVEC 2016 Challenge cross-validation split and Leave-One-Subject-Out cross-validation split, surpassing all baseline models and multiple state-of-the-art models. In Leave-One-Subject-Out testing, it achieves an accuracy of 91.01%, an F1-Score of 85.95%, a precision of 80%, and a recall of 92.86%.</description>

      <title>Supertrust: Foundational AI alignment pivoting from permanent control to mutual trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It's widely expected that humanity will someday create AI systems vastly more intelligent than us, leading to the unsolved alignment problem of "how to control superintelligence." However, this problem is not only self-contradictory but likely unsolvable. Unfortunately, current control-based strategies for solving it inevitably embed dangerous representations of distrust. If superintelligence can't trust humanity, then we can't fully trust it to reliably follow safety controls it can likely bypass. Not only will intended permanent control fail to keep us safe, but it may even trigger the extinction event many fear. A logical rationale is therefore presented that advocates a strategic pivot from control-induced distrust to foundational AI alignment modeling instinct-based representations of familial mutual trust. With current AI already representing distrust of human intentions, the Supertrust meta-strategy is proposed to prevent long-term foundational misalignment and ensure superintelligence is instead driven by intrinsic trust-based patterns, leading to safe and protective coexistence.</description>

      <title>miniCTX: Neural Theorem Proving with (Long-)Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world formal theorem proving often depends on a wealth of context, including definitions, lemmas, comments, file structure, and other information. We introduce miniCTX, which tests a model's ability to prove formal mathematical theorems that depend on new context that is not seen during training. miniCTX contains theorems sourced from real Lean projects and textbooks, each associated with a context that can span tens of thousands of tokens. Models are tasked with proving a theorem given access to code from the theorem's repository, which contains context that is needed for the proof. As a baseline for miniCTX, we tested fine-tuning and prompting methods that condition theorem proving on preceding context. Both approaches substantially outperform traditional methods that rely solely on state information. We found that this ability to use context is not captured by previous benchmarks such as miniF2F. Alongside miniCTX, we offer ntp-toolkit for automatically extracting and annotating theorem proving data, making it easy to add new projects into miniCTX to ensure that contexts are not seen during training. miniCTX offers a challenging and realistic evaluation of neural theorem provers.</description>

      <title>SQL-GEN: Bridging the Dialect Gap for Text-to-SQL Via Synthetic Data And Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-SQL have largely focused on the SQLite dialect, neglecting the diverse landscape of SQL dialects like BigQuery and PostgreSQL. This limitation is due to the diversity in SQL syntaxes and functions, along with the high cost of collecting and curating SQL-specific training data. To address this, we introduce SQL-GEN, a framework for generating high-quality synthetic training data for any SQL dialect, guided by readily available dialect-specific tutorials. SQL-GEN significantly improves cross-dialect Text-to-SQL performance, boosting execution accuracy by up to 20\% over existing methods. This performance gain narrows the gap with models trained on large-scale human-annotated data. Furthermore, combining synthetic data from SQL-GEN with human-annotated data yields additional improvements of up to 5.6\%. To unify multi-dialect capabilities within a single model, we propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) initialization that leverages the shared knowledge across dialects. Our approach merges self-attention layers from dialect-specific models and initializes expert gates using dialect-specific keywords. This leads to a versatile model optimized for multiple SQL dialects, outperforming single-dialect models and significantly enhancing overall performance.</description>

      <title>Explainable Concept Generation through Vision-Language Preference Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concept-based explanations have become a popular choice for explaining deep neural networks post-hoc because, unlike most other explainable AI techniques, they can be used to test high-level visual "concepts" that are not directly related to feature attributes. For instance, the concept of "stripes" is important to classify an image as a zebra. Concept-based explanation methods, however, require practitioners to guess and collect multiple candidate concept image sets, which can often be imprecise and labor-intensive. Addressing this limitation, in this paper, we frame concept image set creation as an image generation problem. However, since naively using a generative model does not result in meaningful concepts, we devise a reinforcement learning-based preference optimization (RLPO) algorithm that fine-tunes the vision-language generative model from approximate textual descriptions of concepts. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the capability of our method to articulate complex and abstract concepts which aligns with the test class that are otherwise challenging to craft manually. In addition to showing the efficacy and reliability of our method, we show how our method can be used as a diagnostic tool for analyzing neural networks.</description>

      <title>A Deep Generative Learning Approach for Two-stage Adaptive Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-stage adaptive robust optimization (ARO) is a powerful approach for planning under uncertainty, balancing first-stage decisions with recourse decisions made after uncertainty is realized. To account for uncertainty, modelers typically define a simple uncertainty set over which potential outcomes are considered. However, classical methods for defining these sets unintentionally capture a wide range of unrealistic outcomes, resulting in overly-conservative and costly planning in anticipation of unlikely contingencies. In this work, we introduce AGRO, a solution algorithm that performs adversarial generation for two-stage adaptive robust optimization using a variational autoencoder. AGRO generates high-dimensional contingencies that are simultaneously adversarial and realistic, improving the robustness of first-stage decisions at a lower planning cost than standard methods. To ensure generated contingencies lie in high-density regions of the uncertainty distribution, AGRO defines a tight uncertainty set as the image of "latent" uncertainty sets under the VAE decoding transformation. Projected gradient ascent is then used to maximize recourse costs over the latent uncertainty sets by leveraging differentiable optimization methods. We demonstrate the cost-efficiency of AGRO by applying it to both a synthetic production-distribution problem and a real-world power system expansion setting. We show that AGRO outperforms the standard column-and-constraint algorithm by up to 1.8% in production-distribution planning and up to 11.6% in power system expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop variational search distributions (VSD), a method for finding discrete, combinatorial designs of a rare desired class in a batch sequential manner with a fixed experimental budget. We formalize the requirements and desiderata for this problem and formulate a solution via variational inference. In particular, VSD uses off-the-shelf gradient based optimization routines, can learn powerful generative models for designs, and can take advantage of scalable predictive models. We derive asymptotic convergence rates for learning the true conditional generative distribution of designs with certain configurations of our method. After illustrating the generative model on images, we empirically demonstrate that VSD can outperform existing baseline methods on a set of real sequence-design problems in various biological systems.</description>

      <title>EIA: Environmental Injection Attack on Generalist Web Agents for Privacy Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalist web agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in autonomously completing a wide range of tasks on real websites, significantly boosting human productivity. However, web tasks, such as booking flights, usually involve users' PII, which may be exposed to potential privacy risks if web agents accidentally interact with compromised websites, a scenario that remains largely unexplored in the literature. In this work, we narrow this gap by conducting the first study on the privacy risks of generalist web agents in adversarial environments. First, we present a realistic threat model for attacks on the website, where we consider two adversarial targets: stealing users' specific PII or the entire user request. Then, we propose a novel attack method, termed Environmental Injection Attack (EIA). EIA injects malicious content designed to adapt well to environments where the agents operate and our work instantiates EIA specifically for privacy scenarios in web environments. We collect 177 action steps that involve diverse PII categories on realistic websites from the Mind2Web, and conduct experiments using one of the most capable generalist web agent frameworks to date. The results demonstrate that EIA achieves up to 70% ASR in stealing specific PII and 16% ASR for full user request. Additionally, by accessing the stealthiness and experimenting with a defensive system prompt, we indicate that EIA is hard to detect and mitigate. Notably, attacks that are not well adapted for a webpage can be detected via human inspection, leading to our discussion about the trade-off between security and autonomy. However, extra attackers' efforts can make EIA seamlessly adapted, rendering such supervision ineffective. Thus, we further discuss the defenses at the pre- and post-deployment stages of the websites without relying on human supervision and call for more advanced defense strategies.</description>

      <title>WaveletGPT: Wavelets Meet Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new wave of artificial intelligence advancements impacting every scientific field and discipline. They are trained on a simple objective: to predict the next token given the previous context. We live in a world where most of the data around us, e.g., text, audio, and music, has a multi-scale structure associated with it. This paper infuses LLMs with traditional signal processing ideas, namely wavelets, during pre-training to take advantage of the structure. Without adding \textbf{any extra parameters} to a GPT-style LLM architecture, we achieve the same pre-training performance almost twice as fast in text, raw audio, and symbolic music. This is achieved by imposing a structure on intermediate embeddings. When trained for the same number of training steps, we achieve significant gains in performance, which is comparable to pre-training a larger neural architecture. Our architecture allows every next token prediction access to intermediate embeddings at different temporal resolutions in every Transformer decoder block. This work will hopefully pave the way for incorporating multi-rate signal processing ideas into traditional LLM pre-training. Further, we showcase pushing model performance by improving internal structure instead of just going after scale.</description>

      <title>A General Framework of the Consistency for Large Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have shown remarkable success, especially in overparameterized or "large" models. Despite increasing empirical evidence and intuitive understanding, a formal mathematical justification for the behavior of such models, particularly regarding overfitting, remains incomplete. In this paper, we propose a general regularization framework to study the Mean Integrated Squared Error (MISE) of neural networks. This framework includes many commonly used neural networks and penalties, such as ReLu and Sigmoid activations and $L^1$, $L^2$ penalties. Based on our frameworks, we find the MISE curve has two possible shapes, namely the shape of double descents and monotone decreasing. The latter phenomenon is new in literature and the causes of these two phenomena are also studied in theory. These studies challenge conventional statistical modeling frameworks and broadens recent findings on the double descent phenomenon in neural networks.</description>

      <title>Embodied-RAG: General Non-parametric Embodied Memory for Retrieval and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18313v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is no limit to how much a robot might explore and learn, but all of that knowledge needs to be searchable and actionable. Within language research, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has become the workhouse of large-scale non-parametric knowledge, however existing techniques do not directly transfer to the embodied domain, which is multimodal, data is highly correlated, and perception requires abstraction.
  To address these challenges, we introduce Embodied-RAG, a framework that enhances the foundational model of an embodied agent with a non-parametric memory system capable of autonomously constructing hierarchical knowledge for both navigation and language generation. Embodied-RAG handles a full range of spatial and semantic resolutions across diverse environments and query types, whether for a specific object or a holistic description of ambiance. At its core, Embodied-RAG's memory is structured as a semantic forest, storing language descriptions at varying levels of detail. This hierarchical organization allows the system to efficiently generate context-sensitive outputs across different robotic platforms. We demonstrate that Embodied-RAG effectively bridges RAG to the robotics domain, successfully handling over 200 explanation and navigation queries across 19 environments, highlighting its promise for general-purpose non-parametric system for embodied agents.</description>

      <title>WHOMP: Optimizing Randomized Controlled Trials via Wasserstein Homogeneity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate methods for partitioning datasets into subgroups that maximize diversity within each subgroup while minimizing dissimilarity across subgroups. We introduce a novel partitioning method called the $\textit{Wasserstein Homogeneity Partition}$ (WHOMP), which optimally minimizes type I and type II errors that often result from imbalanced group splitting or partitioning, commonly referred to as accidental bias, in comparative and controlled trials. We conduct an analytical comparison of WHOMP against existing partitioning methods, such as random subsampling, covariate-adaptive randomization, rerandomization, and anti-clustering, demonstrating its advantages. Moreover, we characterize the optimal solutions to the WHOMP problem and reveal an inherent trade-off between the stability of subgroup means and variances among these solutions. Based on our theoretical insights, we design algorithms that not only obtain these optimal solutions but also equip practitioners with tools to select the desired trade-off. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of WHOMP through numerical experiments, highlighting its superiority over traditional methods.</description>

      <title>LML-DAP: Language Model Learning a Dataset for Data-Augmented Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classification tasks are typically handled using Machine Learning (ML) models, which lack a balance between accuracy and interpretability. This paper introduces a new approach to using Large Language Models (LLMs) for classification tasks in an explainable way. Unlike ML models that rely heavily on data cleaning and feature engineering, this method streamlines the process using LLMs. This paper proposes a new concept called "Language Model Learning (LML)" powered by a new method called "Data-Augmented Prediction (DAP)". The classification is performed by LLMs using a method similar to humans manually exploring and understanding the data and deciding classifications using data as a reference. In the LML process, a dataset is summarized and evaluated to determine the features that lead to the classification of each label the most. In the process of DAP, the system uses the data summary and a row of the testing dataset to automatically generate a query, which is used to retrieve relevant rows from the dataset. A classification is generated by the LLM using data summary and relevant rows, ensuring satisfactory accuracy even with complex data using context-aware decision-making. LML and DAP unlock the possibilities of new applications. The proposed method uses the words "Act as an Explainable Machine Learning Model" in the prompt to enhance the interpretability of the predictions by allowing users to review the logic behind each prediction. In some test cases, the system scored an accuracy above 90%, proving the effectiveness of the system and its potential to outperform conventional ML models in various scenarios.

      <title>Personalisation via Dynamic Policy Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) policies, although optimal in terms of task rewards, may not align with the personal preferences of human users. To ensure this alignment, a naive solution would be to retrain the agent using a reward function that encodes the user's specific preferences. However, such a reward function is typically not readily available, and as such, retraining the agent from scratch can be prohibitively expensive. We propose a more practical approach - to adapt the already trained policy to user-specific needs with the help of human feedback. To this end, we infer the user's intent through trajectory-level feedback and combine it with the trained task policy via a theoretically grounded dynamic policy fusion approach. As our approach collects human feedback on the very same trajectories used to learn the task policy, it does not require any additional interactions with the environment, making it a zero-shot approach. We empirically demonstrate in a number of environments that our proposed dynamic policy fusion approach consistently achieves the intended task while simultaneously adhering to user-specific needs.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Disease Progression with Parallel Hyperplanes in Longitudinal Retinal OCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting future disease progression risk from medical images is challenging due to patient heterogeneity, and subtle or unknown imaging biomarkers. Moreover, deep learning (DL) methods for survival analysis are susceptible to image domain shifts across scanners. We tackle these issues in the task of predicting late dry Age-related Macular Degeneration (dAMD) onset from retinal OCT scans. We propose a novel DL method for survival prediction to jointly predict from the current scan a risk score, inversely related to time-to-conversion, and the probability of conversion within a time interval $t$. It uses a family of parallel hyperplanes generated by parameterizing the bias term as a function of $t$. In addition, we develop unsupervised losses based on intra-subject image pairs to ensure that risk scores increase over time and that future conversion predictions are consistent with AMD stage prediction using actual scans of future visits. Such losses enable data-efficient fine-tuning of the trained model on new unlabeled datasets acquired with a different scanner. Extensive evaluation on two large datasets acquired with different scanners resulted in a mean AUROCs of 0.82 for Dataset-1 and 0.83 for Dataset-2, across prediction intervals of 6,12 and 24 months.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NECOMIMI (NEural-COgnitive MultImodal EEG-Informed Image Generation with Diffusion Models) introduces a novel framework for generating images directly from EEG signals using advanced diffusion models. Unlike previous works that focused solely on EEG-image classification through contrastive learning, NECOMIMI extends this task to image generation. The proposed NERV EEG encoder demonstrates state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance across multiple zero-shot classification tasks, including 2-way, 4-way, and 200-way, and achieves top results in our newly proposed Category-based Assessment Table (CAT) Score, which evaluates the quality of EEG-generated images based on semantic concepts. A key discovery of this work is that the model tends to generate abstract or generalized images, such as landscapes, rather than specific objects, highlighting the inherent challenges of translating noisy and low-resolution EEG data into detailed visual outputs. Additionally, we introduce the CAT Score as a new metric tailored for EEG-to-image evaluation and establish a benchmark on the ThingsEEG dataset. This study underscores the potential of EEG-to-image generation while revealing the complexities and challenges that remain in bridging neural activity with visual representation.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Copy Bias in In-Context Learning through Neuron Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive few-shot in-context learning (ICL) abilities. Still, we show that they are sometimes prone to a `copying bias', where they copy answers from provided examples instead of learning the underlying patterns. In this work, we propose a novel and simple method to mitigate such copying bias. First, we create a synthetic task and use the Integrated Gradients method to identify neurons that prioritize copying over generalization. We demonstrate that pruning these neurons consistently improves performance across a diverse set of ICL tasks. We also show that our method is applicable across various LLM architectures, including Transformers and State-Space Models, without requiring modifications. In our analysis, we adopt a task-recognition perspective on ICL and examine task vectors (Hendel et al., 2023) induced by the model. We find that pruning enhances the quality of these vectors, suggesting that the pruned neurons previously hindered effective task recognition.</description>

      <title>LEGO: Learnable Expansion of Graph Operators for Multi-Modal Feature Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In computer vision tasks, features often come from diverse representations, domains, and modalities, such as text, images, and videos. Effectively fusing these features is essential for robust performance, especially with the availability of powerful pre-trained models like vision-language models. However, common fusion methods, such as concatenation, element-wise operations, and non-linear techniques, often fail to capture structural relationships, deep feature interactions, and suffer from inefficiency or misalignment of features across domains. In this paper, we shift from high-dimensional feature space to a lower-dimensional, interpretable graph space by constructing similarity graphs that encode feature relationships at different levels, e.g., clip, frame, patch, token, etc. To capture deeper interactions, we use graph power expansions and introduce a learnable graph fusion operator to combine these graph powers for more effective fusion. Our approach is relationship-centric, operates in a homogeneous space, and is mathematically principled, resembling element-wise similarity score aggregation via multilinear polynomials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph-based fusion method on video anomaly detection, showing strong performance across multi-representational, multi-modal, and multi-domain feature fusion tasks.</description>

      <title>Integrative Decoding: Improve Factuality via Implicit Self-consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-consistency-based approaches, which involve repeatedly sampling multiple outputs and selecting the most consistent one as the final response, prove to be remarkably effective in improving the factual accuracy of large language models. Nonetheless, existing methods usually have strict constraints on the task format, largely limiting their applicability. In this paper, we present Integrative Decoding (ID), to unlock the potential of self-consistency in open-ended generation tasks. ID operates by constructing a set of inputs, each prepended with a previously sampled response, and then processes them concurrently, with the next token being selected by aggregating of all their corresponding predictions at each decoding step. In essence, this simple approach implicitly incorporates self-consistency in the decoding objective. Extensive evaluation shows that ID consistently enhances factuality over a wide range of language models, with substantial improvements on the TruthfulQA (+11.2%), Biographies (+15.4%) and LongFact (+8.5%) benchmarks. The performance gains amplify progressively as the number of sampled responses increases, indicating the potential of ID to scale up with repeated sampling.</description>

      <title>Fake It Until You Break It: On the Adversarial Robustness of AI-generated Image Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While generative AI (GenAI) offers countless possibilities for creative and productive tasks, artificially generated media can be misused for fraud, manipulation, scams, misinformation campaigns, and more. To mitigate the risks associated with maliciously generated media, forensic classifiers are employed to identify AI-generated content. However, current forensic classifiers are often not evaluated in practically relevant scenarios, such as the presence of an attacker or when real-world artifacts like social media degradations affect images. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art AI-generated image (AIGI) detectors under different attack scenarios. We demonstrate that forensic classifiers can be effectively attacked in realistic settings, even when the attacker does not have access to the target model and post-processing occurs after the adversarial examples are created, which is standard on social media platforms. These attacks can significantly reduce detection accuracy to the extent that the risks of relying on detectors outweigh their benefits. Finally, we propose a simple defense mechanism to make CLIP-based detectors, which are currently the best-performing detectors, robust against these attacks.</description>
