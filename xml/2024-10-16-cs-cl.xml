      <title>Investigating the Impact of Text Summarization on Topic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topic models are used to identify and group similar themes in a set of documents. Recent advancements in deep learning based neural topic models has received significant research interest. In this paper, an approach is proposed that further enhances topic modeling performance by utilizing a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to generate summaries of documents before inputting them into the topic model. Few shot prompting is used to generate summaries of different lengths to compare their impact on topic modeling. This approach is particularly effective for larger documents because it helps capture the most essential information while reducing noise and irrelevant details that could obscure the overall theme. Additionally, it is observed that datasets exhibit an optimal summary length that leads to improved topic modeling performance. The proposed method yields better topic diversity and comparable coherence values compared to previous models.</description>

      <title>A Large Language Model-based Framework for Semi-Structured Tender Document Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The drafting of documents in the procurement field has progressively become more complex and diverse, driven by the need to meet legal requirements, adapt to technological advancements, and address stakeholder demands. While large language models (LLMs) show potential in document generation, most LLMs lack specialized knowledge in procurement. To address this gap, we use retrieval-augmented techniques to achieve professional document generation, ensuring accuracy and relevance in procurement documentation.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Augmented Reasoning for EUAIA Compliance and Adversarial Robustness of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The EU AI Act (EUAIA) introduces requirements for AI systems which intersect with the processes required to establish adversarial robustness. However, given the ambiguous language of regulation and the dynamicity of adversarial attacks, developers of systems with highly complex models such as LLMs may find their effort to be duplicated without the assurance of having achieved either compliance or robustness. This paper presents a functional architecture that focuses on bridging the two properties, by introducing components with clear reference to their source. Taking the detection layer recommended by the literature, and the reporting layer required by the law, we aim to support developers and auditors with a reasoning layer based on knowledge augmentation (rules, assurance cases, contextual mappings). Our findings demonstrate a novel direction for ensuring LLMs deployed in the EU are both compliant and adversarially robust, which underpin trustworthiness.</description>

      <title>BIPEFT: Budget-Guided Iterative Search for Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Pretrained Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) offers an efficient solution for fine-tuning large pretrained language models for downstream tasks. However, most PEFT strategies are manually designed, often resulting in suboptimal performance. Recent automatic PEFT approaches aim to address this but face challenges such as search space entanglement, inefficiency, and lack of integration between parameter budgets and search processes. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel Budget-guided Iterative search strategy for automatic PEFT (BIPEFT), significantly enhancing search efficiency. BIPEFT employs a new iterative search strategy to disentangle the binary module and rank dimension search spaces. Additionally, we design early selection strategies based on parameter budgets, accelerating the learning process by gradually removing unimportant modules and fixing rank dimensions. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of BIPEFT in achieving efficient and effective PEFT for downstream tasks with a low parameter budget.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Robotics Systems Issues with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quickly resolving issues reported in industrial applications is crucial to minimize economic impact. However, the required data analysis makes diagnosing the underlying root causes a challenging and time-consuming task, even for experts. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) excel at analyzing large amounts of data. Indeed, prior work in AI-Ops demonstrates their effectiveness in analyzing IT systems. Here, we extend this work to the challenging and largely unexplored domain of robotics systems. To this end, we create SYSDIAGBENCH, a proprietary system diagnostics benchmark for robotics, containing over 2500 reported issues. We leverage SYSDIAGBENCH to investigate the performance of LLMs for root cause analysis, considering a range of model sizes and adaptation techniques. Our results show that QLoRA finetuning can be sufficient to let a 7B-parameter model outperform GPT-4 in terms of diagnostic accuracy while being significantly more cost-effective. We validate our LLM-as-a-judge results with a human expert study and find that our best model achieves similar approval ratings as our reference labels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks, but their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks poses significant security risks. This survey paper presents a comprehensive analysis of recent advancements in attack strategies and defense mechanisms within the field of Large Language Model (LLM) red-teaming. We analyze various attack methods, including gradient-based optimization, reinforcement learning, and prompt engineering approaches. We discuss the implications of these attacks on LLM safety and the need for improved defense mechanisms. This work aims to provide a thorough understanding of the current landscape of red-teaming attacks and defenses on LLMs, enabling the development of more secure and reliable language models.</description>

      <title>ACER: Automatic Language Model Context Extension via Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-context modeling is one of the critical capabilities of language AI for digesting and reasoning over complex information pieces. In practice, long-context capabilities are typically built into a pre-trained language model~(LM) through a carefully designed context extension stage, with the goal of producing generalist long-context capabilities. In our preliminary experiments, however, we discovered that the current open-weight generalist long-context models are still lacking in practical long-context processing tasks. While this means perfectly effective long-context modeling demands task-specific data, the cost can be prohibitive. In this paper, we draw inspiration from how humans process a large body of information: a lossy \textbf{retrieval} stage ranks a large set of documents while the reader ends up reading deeply only the top candidates. We build an \textbf{automatic} data synthesis pipeline that mimics this process using short-context LMs. The short-context LMs are further tuned using these self-generated data to obtain task-specific long-context capabilities. Similar to how pre-training learns from imperfect data, we hypothesize and further demonstrate that the short-context model can bootstrap over the synthetic data, outperforming not only long-context generalist models but also the retrieval and read pipeline used to synthesize the training data in real-world tasks such as long-context retrieval augmented generation.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Training Approaches for LLMs: Leveraging Real and Synthetic Data to Enhance Model Performance in Domain-Specific Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research explores a hybrid approach to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) by integrating real-world and synthetic data to boost model performance, particularly in generating accurate and contextually relevant responses. By leveraging a dataset combining transcribed real interactions with high-quality synthetic sessions, we aimed to overcome the limitations of scarce, noisy, and domain-specific real data. Synthetic personas and scenarios were employed to enhance training diversity. The study evaluated three models: a base foundational model, a model fine-tuned with real data, and a hybrid fine-tuned model. Experimental results showed that the hybrid model consistently outperformed the others in specific vertical applications, achieving the highest scores across all metrics. Further testing confirmed the hybrid model's superior adaptability and contextual understanding across diverse scenarios. These findings suggest that combining real and synthetic data can significantly improve the robustness and contextual sensitivity of LLMs, particularly in domain-specific and vertical use cases.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware SQL Error Correction Using Few-Shot Learning -- A Novel Approach Based on NLQ, Error, and SQL Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the demand for automated SQL generation has increased significantly, driven by the need for efficient data querying in various applications. However, generating accurate SQL queries remains a challenge due to the complexity and variability of natural language inputs. This paper introduces a novel few-shot learning-based approach for error correction in SQL generation, enhancing the accuracy of generated queries by selecting the most suitable few-shot error correction examples for a given natural language question (NLQ). In our experiments with the open-source Gretel dataset, the proposed model offers a 39.2% increase in fixing errors from the baseline approach with no error correction and a 10% increase from a simple error correction method. The proposed technique leverages embedding-based similarity measures to identify the closest matches from a repository of few-shot examples. Each example comprises an incorrect SQL query, the resulting error, the correct SQL query, and detailed steps to transform the incorrect query into the correct one. By employing this method, the system can effectively guide the correction of errors in newly generated SQL queries. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in SQL generation accuracy by providing contextually relevant examples that facilitate error identification and correction. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of embedding-based selection in enhancing the few-shot learning process, leading to more precise and reliable SQL query generation. This research contributes to the field of automated SQL generation by offering a robust framework for error correction, paving the way for more advanced and user-friendly database interaction tools.</description>

      <title>L3Cube-MahaSum: A Comprehensive Dataset and BART Models for Abstractive Text Summarization in Marathi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the MahaSUM dataset, a large-scale collection of diverse news articles in Marathi, designed to facilitate the training and evaluation of models for abstractive summarization tasks in Indic languages. The dataset, containing 25k samples, was created by scraping articles from a wide range of online news sources and manually verifying the abstract summaries. Additionally, we train an IndicBART model, a variant of the BART model tailored for Indic languages, using the MahaSUM dataset. We evaluate the performance of our trained models on the task of abstractive summarization and demonstrate their effectiveness in producing high-quality summaries in Marathi. Our work contributes to the advancement of natural language processing research in Indic languages and provides a valuable resource for future research in this area using state-of-the-art models. The dataset and models are shared publicly at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/MarathiNLP</description>

      <title>Long Range Named Entity Recognition for Marathi Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) methods, particularly Named Entity Recognition (NER), has increased due to the exponential growth of Marathi-language digital content. In particular, NER is essential for recognizing distant entities and for arranging and understanding unstructured Marathi text data. With an emphasis on managing long-range entities, this paper offers a comprehensive analysis of current NER techniques designed for Marathi documents. It dives into current practices and investigates the BERT transformer model's potential for long-range Marathi NER. Along with analyzing the effectiveness of earlier methods, the report draws comparisons between NER in English literature and suggests adaptation strategies for Marathi literature. The paper discusses the difficulties caused by Marathi's particular linguistic traits and contextual subtleties while acknowledging NER's critical role in NLP. To conclude, this project is a major step forward in improving Marathi NER techniques, with potential wider applications across a range of NLP tasks and domains.</description>

      <title>M3Hop-CoT: Misogynous Meme Identification with Multimodal Multi-hop Chain-of-Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a significant rise in the phenomenon of hate against women on social media platforms, particularly through the use of misogynous memes. These memes often target women with subtle and obscure cues, making their detection a challenging task for automated systems. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in reasoning using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to generate the intermediate reasoning chains as the rationale to facilitate multimodal tasks, but often neglect cultural diversity and key aspects like emotion and contextual knowledge hidden in the visual modalities. To address this gap, we introduce a Multimodal Multi-hop CoT (M3Hop-CoT) framework for Misogynous meme identification, combining a CLIP-based classifier and a multimodal CoT module with entity-object-relationship integration. M3Hop-CoT employs a three-step multimodal prompting principle to induce emotions, target awareness, and contextual knowledge for meme analysis. Our empirical evaluation, including both qualitative and quantitative analysis, validates the efficacy of the M3Hop-CoT framework on the SemEval-2022 Task 5 (MAMI task) dataset, highlighting its strong performance in the macro-F1 score. Furthermore, we evaluate the model's generalizability by evaluating it on various benchmark meme datasets, offering a thorough insight into the effectiveness of our approach across different datasets.</description>

      <title>The Same But Different: Structural Similarities and Differences in Multilingual Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ new tools from mechanistic interpretability in order to ask whether the internal structure of large language models (LLMs) shows correspondence to the linguistic structures which underlie the languages on which they are trained. In particular, we ask (1) when two languages employ the same morphosyntactic processes, do LLMs handle them using shared internal circuitry? and (2) when two languages require different morphosyntactic processes, do LLMs handle them using different internal circuitry? Using English and Chinese multilingual and monolingual models, we analyze the internal circuitry involved in two tasks. We find evidence that models employ the same circuit to handle the same syntactic process independently of the language in which it occurs, and that this is the case even for monolingual models trained completely independently. Moreover, we show that multilingual models employ language-specific components (attention heads and feed-forward networks) when needed to handle linguistic processes (e.g., morphological marking) that only exist in some languages. Together, our results provide new insights into how LLMs trade off between exploiting common structures and preserving linguistic differences when tasked with modeling multiple languages simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Improving semantic understanding in speech language models via brain-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech-language models align impressively with human brain responses to natural language. However, current models rely heavily on low-level speech features, indicating they lack brain-relevant semantics, limiting their utility as models of semantic processing in the brain. In this work, we address this limitation by inducing brain-relevant bias into the models via fine-tuning with fMRI recordings of people listening to natural stories, a process we call brain-tuning. After testing it on three different pretrained backbones, we show that brain-tuning improves alignment with new brain recordings in semantic language regions and reduces reliance on low-level speech features. Notably, brain-tuning leads to 1) consistent improvements in performance across various downstream tasks and 2) a representational space with increased semantic preference. Our results provide the first evidence that incorporating brain signals into the training of language models improves their semantic understanding.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiology reports summarize key findings and differential diagnoses derived from medical imaging examinations. The extraction of differential diagnoses is crucial for downstream tasks, including patient management and treatment planning. However, the unstructured nature of these reports, characterized by diverse linguistic styles and inconsistent formatting, presents significant challenges. Although proprietary large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 can effectively retrieve clinical information, their use is limited in practice by high costs and concerns over the privacy of protected health information (PHI). This study introduces a pipeline for developing in-house LLMs tailored to identify differential diagnoses from radiology reports. We first utilize GPT-4 to create 31,056 labeled reports, then fine-tune open source LLM using this dataset. Evaluated on a set of 1,067 reports annotated by clinicians, the proposed model achieves an average F1 score of 92.1\%, which is on par with GPT-4 (90.8\%). Through this study, we provide a methodology for constructing in-house LLMs that: match the performance of GPT, reduce dependence on expensive proprietary models, and enhance the privacy and security of PHI.</description>

      <title>Sui Generis: Large Language Models for Authorship Attribution and Verification in Latin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in authorship attribution and authorship verification tasks for Latin texts of the Patristic Era. The study showcases that LLMs can be robust in zero-shot authorship verification even on short texts without sophisticated feature engineering. Yet, the models can also be easily "mislead" by semantics. The experiments also demonstrate that steering the model's authorship analysis and decision-making is challenging, unlike what is reported in the studies dealing with high-resource modern languages. Although LLMs prove to be able to beat, under certain circumstances, the traditional baselines, obtaining a nuanced and truly explainable decision requires at best a lot of experimentation.</description>

      <title>ReasonPlanner: Enhancing Autonomous Planning in Dynamic Environments with Temporal Knowledge Graphs and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planning and performing interactive tasks, such as conducting experiments to determine the melting point of an unknown substance, is straightforward for humans but poses significant challenges for autonomous agents. We introduce ReasonPlanner, a novel generalist agent designed for reflective thinking, planning, and interactive reasoning. This agent leverages LLMs to plan hypothetical trajectories by building a World Model based on a Temporal Knowledge Graph. The agent interacts with the environment using a natural language actor-critic module, where the actor translates the imagined trajectory into a sequence of actionable steps, and the critic determines if replanning is necessary. ReasonPlanner significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art prompting-based methods on the ScienceWorld benchmark by more than 1.8 times, while being more sample-efficient and interpretable. It relies solely on frozen weights thus requiring no gradient updates. ReasonPlanner can be deployed and utilized without specialized knowledge of Machine Learning, making it accessible to a wide range of users.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Static and Contextual Embeddings for Analyzing Semantic Changes in Medieval Latin Charters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Norman Conquest of 1066 C.E. brought profound transformations to England's administrative, societal, and linguistic practices. The DEEDS (Documents of Early England Data Set) database offers a unique opportunity to explore these changes by examining shifts in word meanings within a vast collection of Medieval Latin charters. While computational linguistics typically relies on vector representations of words like static and contextual embeddings to analyze semantic changes, existing embeddings for scarce and historical Medieval Latin are limited and may not be well-suited for this task. This paper presents the first computational analysis of semantic change pre- and post-Norman Conquest and the first systematic comparison of static and contextual embeddings in a scarce historical data set. Our findings confirm that, consistent with existing studies, contextual embeddings outperform static word embeddings in capturing semantic change within a scarce historical corpus.</description>

      <title>Nudging: Inference-time Alignment via Model Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require alignment, such as instruction-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback, to effectively and safely follow user instructions. This process necessitates training aligned versions for every model size in each model family, resulting in significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose nudging, a simple, plug-and-play, and training-free algorithm that aligns any base model at inference time using a small aligned model. Nudging is motivated by recent findings that alignment primarily alters the model's behavior on a small subset of stylistic tokens, such as "Sure" or "Thank". We find that base models are significantly more uncertain when generating these tokens. Leveraging this observation, nudging employs a small aligned model to generate nudging tokens to steer the large base model's output toward desired directions when the base model's uncertainty is high. We evaluate the effectiveness of nudging across 3 model families and 13 tasks, covering reasoning, general knowledge, instruction following, and safety benchmarks. Without any additional training, nudging a large base model with a 7x - 14x smaller aligned model achieves zero-shot performance comparable to, and sometimes surpassing, that of large aligned models. For example, nudging OLMo-7b with OLMo-1b-instruct, affecting less than 9% of tokens, achieves a 10% absolute improvement on GSM8K over OLMo-7b-instruct. Unlike prior inference-time tuning methods, nudging enables off-the-shelf collaboration between model families. For instance, nudging Gemma-2-27b with Llama-2-7b-chat outperforms Llama-2-70b-chat on various tasks. Overall, this work introduces a simple yet powerful approach to token-level model collaboration, offering a modular solution to LLM alignment.

      <title>Exact Byte-Level Probabilities from Tokenized Language Models for FIM-Tasks and Model Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tokenization is associated with many poorly understood shortcomings in language models (LMs), yet remains an important component for long sequence scaling purposes. This work studies how tokenization impacts model performance by analyzing and comparing the stochastic behavior of tokenized models with their byte-level, or token-free, counterparts. We discover that, even when the two models are statistically equivalent, their predictive distributions over the next byte can be substantially different, a phenomenon we term as "tokenization bias''. To fully characterize this phenomenon, we introduce the Byte-Token Representation Lemma, a framework that establishes a mapping between the learned token distribution and its equivalent byte-level distribution. From this result, we develop a next-byte sampling algorithm that eliminates tokenization bias without requiring further training or optimization. In other words, this enables zero-shot conversion of tokenized LMs into statistically equivalent token-free ones. We demonstrate its broad applicability with two use cases: fill-in-the-middle (FIM) tasks and model ensembles. In FIM tasks where input prompts may terminate mid-token, leading to out-of-distribution tokenization, our method mitigates performance degradation and achieves an approximately 18% improvement in FIM coding benchmarks, consistently outperforming the standard token healing fix. For model ensembles where each model employs a distinct vocabulary, our approach enables seamless integration, resulting in improved performance (up to 3.7%) over individual models across various standard baselines in reasoning, knowledge, and coding.</description>

      <title>\llinstruct: An Instruction-tuned model for English Language Proficiency Assessments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present \llinstruct: An 8B instruction-tuned model that is designed to generate content for English Language Proficiency Assessments (ELPA) and related applications. Our work involves creating a new dataset of 70K instructions and explanations in the ELPA domain and using these to fine-tune Llama-3 8B models (SFT) of different sizes (e.g., SFT-17K, SFT-50K and SFT-70K). Human evaluations are conducted over unseen instructions to compare these SFT models against SOTA models (e.g., Dolly-2, Mistral, Llama-3 base version, and GPT-3.5). The findings show although all three SFT models perform comparably, the model trained on largest instruction dataset -- SFT-70K - leads to the most valid outputs ready for assessments. However, although the SFT models perform better than larger model, e.g., GPT 3.5 on the aspect of explanations of outputs, many outputs still need human interventions to make them actual ready for real world assessments.</description>

      <title>Impeding LLM-assisted Cheating in Introductory Programming Assignments via Adversarial Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large language model (LLM)-based programming assistants such as CoPilot and ChatGPT can help improve the productivity of professional software developers, they can also facilitate cheating in introductory computer programming courses. Assuming instructors have limited control over the industrial-strength models, this paper investigates the baseline performance of 5 widely used LLMs on a collection of introductory programming problems, examines adversarial perturbations to degrade their performance, and describes the results of a user study aimed at understanding the efficacy of such perturbations in hindering actual code generation for introductory programming assignments. The user study suggests that i) perturbations combinedly reduced the average correctness score by 77%, ii) the drop in correctness caused by these perturbations was affected based on their detectability.</description>

      <title>Hey AI Can You Grade My Essay?: Automatic Essay Grading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic essay grading (AEG) has attracted the the attention of the NLP community because of its applications to several educational applications, such as scoring essays, short answers, etc. AEG systems can save significant time and money when grading essays. In the existing works, the essays are graded where a single network is responsible for the whole process, which may be ineffective because a single network may not be able to learn all the features of a human-written essay. In this work, we have introduced a new model that outperforms the state-of-the-art models in the field of AEG. We have used the concept of collaborative and transfer learning, where one network will be responsible for checking the grammatical and structural features of the sentences of an essay while another network is responsible for scoring the overall idea present in the essay. These learnings are transferred to another network to score the essay. We also compared the performances of the different models mentioned in our work, and our proposed model has shown the highest accuracy of 85.50%.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Data Selection at Scale: Random Selection is Almost All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human instructions. The primary goal during SFT is to select a small yet representative subset of training data from the larger pool, such that fine-tuning with this subset achieves results comparable to or even exceeding those obtained using the entire dataset. However, most existing data selection techniques are designed for small-scale data pools, which fail to meet the demands of real-world SFT scenarios. In this paper, we replicated several self-scoring methods those that do not rely on external model assistance on two million scale datasets, and found that nearly all methods struggled to significantly outperform random selection when dealing with such large-scale data pools. Moreover, our comparisons suggest that, during SFT, diversity in data selection is more critical than simply focusing on high quality data. We also analyzed the limitations of several current approaches, explaining why they perform poorly on large-scale datasets and why they are unsuitable for such contexts. Finally, we found that filtering data by token length offers a stable and efficient method for improving results. This approach, particularly when training on long text data, proves highly beneficial for relatively weaker base models, such as Llama3.</description>

      <title>Keys to Robust Edits: from Theoretical Insights to Practical Advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized knowledge storage and retrieval, but face challenges with conflicting and outdated information. Knowledge editing techniques have been proposed to address these issues, yet they struggle with robustness tests involving long contexts, paraphrased subjects, and continuous edits. This work investigates the cause of these failures in locate-and-edit methods, offering theoretical insights into their key-value modeling and deriving mathematical bounds for robust and specific edits, leading to a novel 'group discussion' conceptual model for locate-and-edit methods. Empirical analysis reveals that keys used by current methods fail to meet robustness and specificity requirements. To address this, we propose a Robust Edit Pathway (REP) that disentangles editing keys from LLMs' inner representations. Evaluations on LLaMA2-7B and Mistral-7B using the CounterFact dataset show that REP significantly improves robustness across various metrics, both in-domain and out-of-domain, with minimal trade-offs in success rate and locality. Our findings advance the development of reliable and flexible knowledge updating in LLMs.</description>

      <title>LLM$\times$MapReduce: Simplified Long-Sequence Processing using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enlarging the context window of large language models (LLMs) has become a crucial research area, particularly for applications involving extremely long texts. In this work, we propose a novel training-free framework for processing long texts, utilizing a divide-and-conquer strategy to achieve comprehensive document understanding. The proposed LLM$\times$MapReduce framework splits the entire document into several chunks for LLMs to read and then aggregates the intermediate answers to produce the final output. The main challenge for divide-and-conquer long text processing frameworks lies in the risk of losing essential long-range information when splitting the document, which can lead the model to produce incomplete or incorrect answers based on the segmented texts. Disrupted long-range information can be classified into two categories: inter-chunk dependency and inter-chunk conflict. We design a structured information protocol to better cope with inter-chunk dependency and an in-context confidence calibration mechanism to resolve inter-chunk conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM$\times$MapReduce can outperform representative open-source and commercial long-context LLMs, and is applicable to several different models.</description>

      <title>ELICIT: LLM Augmentation via External In-Context Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the adaptive capabilities of large language models is a critical pursuit in both research and application. Traditional fine-tuning methods require substantial data and computational resources, especially for enhancing specific capabilities, while in-context learning is limited by the need for appropriate demonstrations and efficient token usage. Inspired by the expression of in-context learned capabilities through task vectors and the concept of modularization, we propose \alg, a framework consisting of two modules designed to effectively store and reuse task vectors to elicit the diverse capabilities of models without additional training or inference tokens. Our comprehensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that our pipeline is highly transferable across different input formats, tasks, and model architectures. ELICIT serves as a plug-and-play performance booster to enable adaptive elicitation of model capabilities. By externally storing and reusing vectors that represent in-context learned capabilities, \alg not only demonstrates the potential to operate modular capabilities but also significantly enhances the performance, versatility, adaptability, and scalability of large language models. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/LINs-lab/ELICIT.</description>

      <title>Generative Subgraph Retrieval for Knowledge Graph-Grounded Dialog Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graph-grounded dialog generation requires retrieving a dialog-relevant subgraph from the given knowledge base graph and integrating it with the dialog history. Previous works typically represent the graph using an external encoder, such as graph neural networks, and retrieve relevant triplets based on the similarity between single-vector representations of triplets and the dialog history. However, these external encoders fail to leverage the rich knowledge of pretrained language models, and the retrieval process is also suboptimal due to the information bottleneck caused by the single-vector abstraction of the dialog history. In this work, we propose Dialog generation with Generative Subgraph Retrieval (DialogGSR), which retrieves relevant knowledge subgraphs by directly generating their token sequences on top of language models. For effective generative subgraph retrieval, we introduce two key methods: (i) structure-aware knowledge graph linearization with self-supervised graph-specific tokens and (ii) graph-constrained decoding utilizing graph structural proximity-based entity informativeness scores for valid and relevant generative retrieval. DialogGSR achieves state-of-the-art performance in knowledge graph-grounded dialog generation, as demonstrated on OpenDialKG and KOMODIS datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text classification is a quintessential and practical problem in natural language processing with applications in diverse domains such as sentiment analysis, fake news detection, medical diagnosis, and document classification. A sizable body of recent works exists where researchers have studied and tackled text classification from different angles with varying degrees of success. Graph convolution network (GCN)-based approaches have gained a lot of traction in this domain over the last decade with many implementations achieving state-of-the-art performance in more recent literature and thus, warranting the need for an updated survey. This work aims to summarize and categorize various GCN-based Text Classification approaches with regard to the architecture and mode of supervision. It identifies their strengths and limitations and compares their performance on various benchmark datasets. We also discuss future research directions and the challenges that exist in this domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While server-side Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate proficiency in function calling and complex reasoning, deploying Small Language Models (SLMs) directly on devices brings opportunities to improve latency and privacy but also introduces unique challenges for accuracy and memory. We introduce CAMPHOR, an innovative on-device SLM multi-agent framework designed to handle multiple user inputs and reason over personal context locally, ensuring privacy is maintained. CAMPHOR employs a hierarchical architecture where a high-order reasoning agent decomposes complex tasks and coordinates expert agents responsible for personal context retrieval, tool interaction, and dynamic plan generation. By implementing parameter sharing across agents and leveraging prompt compression, we significantly reduce model size, latency, and memory usage. To validate our approach, we present a novel dataset capturing multi-agent task trajectories centered on personalized mobile assistant use-cases. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuned SLM agents not only surpass closed-source LLMs in task completion F1 by~35\% but also eliminate the need for server-device communication, all while enhancing privacy.</description>

      <title>FB-Bench: A Fine-Grained Multi-Task Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs' Responsiveness to Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human feedback is crucial in the interactions between humans and Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing research primarily focuses on benchmarking LLMs in single-turn dialogues. Even in benchmarks designed for multi-turn dialogues, the user inputs are often independent, neglecting the nuanced and complex nature of human feedback within real-world usage scenarios. To fill this research gap, we introduce FB-Bench, a fine-grained, multi-task benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' responsiveness to human feedback in real-world usage scenarios. Drawing from the two main interaction scenarios, FB-Bench comprises 734 meticulously curated samples, encompassing eight task types, five deficiency types of response, and nine feedback types. We extensively evaluate a broad array of popular LLMs, revealing significant variations in their performance across different interaction scenarios. Further analysis indicates that task, human feedback, and deficiencies of previous responses can also significantly impact LLMs' responsiveness. Our findings underscore both the strengths and limitations of current models, providing valuable insights and directions for future research. Both the toolkits and the dataset of FB-Bench are available at https://github.com/PKU-Baichuan-MLSystemLab/FB-Bench.</description>

      <title>Beyond Exact Match: Semantically Reassessing Event Extraction by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event extraction has gained extensive research attention due to its broad range of applications. However, the current mainstream evaluation method for event extraction relies on token-level exact match, which misjudges numerous semantic-level correct cases. This reliance leads to a significant discrepancy between the evaluated performance of models under exact match criteria and their real performance. To address this problem, we propose RAEE, an automatic evaluation framework that accurately assesses event extraction results at semantic-level instead of token-level. Specifically, RAEE leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic evaluation agents, incorporating chain-of-thought prompting and an adaptive mechanism to achieve interpretable and adaptive evaluations for precision and recall of triggers and arguments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) RAEE achieves a very high correlation with the human average; (2) after reassessing 14 models, including advanced LLMs, on 10 datasets, there is a significant performance gap between exact match and RAEE. The exact match evaluation significantly underestimates the performance of existing event extraction models, particularly underestimating the capabilities of LLMs; (3) fine-grained analysis under RAEE evaluation reveals insightful phenomena worth further exploration. The evaluation toolkit of our proposed RAEE will be publicly released.</description>

      <title>FlatQuant: Flatness Matters for LLM Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, quantization has been widely used for the compression and acceleration of large language models~(LLMs). Due to the outliers in LLMs, it is crucial to flatten weights and activations to minimize quantization error with the equally spaced quantization points. Prior research explores various pre-quantization transformations to suppress outliers, such as per-channel scaling and Hadamard transformation. However, we observe that these transformed weights and activations can still remain steep and outspread. In this paper, we propose FlatQuant (Fast and Learnable Affine Transformation), a new post-training quantization approach to enhance flatness of weights and activations. Our approach identifies optimal affine transformations tailored to each linear layer, calibrated in hours via a lightweight objective. To reduce runtime overhead, we apply Kronecker decomposition to the transformation matrices, and fuse all operations in FlatQuant into a single kernel. Extensive experiments show that FlatQuant sets up a new state-of-the-art quantization benchmark. For instance, it achieves less than $\textbf{1}\%$ accuracy drop for W4A4 quantization on the LLaMA-3-70B model, surpassing SpinQuant by $\textbf{7.5}\%$. For inference latency, FlatQuant reduces the slowdown induced by pre-quantization transformation from 0.26x of QuaRot to merely $\textbf{0.07x}$, bringing up to $\textbf{2.3x}$ speedup for prefill and $\textbf{1.7x}$ speedup for decoding, respectively.

      <title>Solving the Challenge Set without Solving the Task: On Winograd Schemas as a Test of Pronominal Coreference Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Challenge sets such as the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) are used to benchmark systems' ability to resolve ambiguities in natural language. If one assumes as in existing work that solving a given challenge set is at least as difficult as solving some more general task, then high performance on the challenge set should indicate high performance on the general task overall. However, we show empirically that this assumption of difficulty does not always hold. In particular, we demonstrate that despite the strong performance of prompted language models (LMs) on the WSC and its variants, these same modeling techniques perform relatively poorly at resolving certain pronominal ambiguities attested in OntoNotes and related datasets that are perceived to be easier. Motivated by these findings, we propose a method for ensembling a prompted LM with a supervised, task-specific system that is overall more accurate at resolving pronominal coreference across datasets. Finally, we emphasize that datasets involving the same linguistic phenomenon draw on distinct, but overlapping, capabilities, and evaluating on any one dataset alone does not provide a complete picture of a system's overall capability.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Video based Stress Detection with Self-Refine Chain-of-thought Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stress detection is a critical area of research with significant implications for health monitoring and intervention systems. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretable approach for video-based stress detection, leveraging self-refine chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance both accuracy and transparency in decision-making processes. Our method focuses on extracting subtle behavioral and physiological cues from video sequences that indicate stress levels. By incorporating a chain-of-thought reasoning mechanism, the system refines its predictions iteratively, ensuring that the decision-making process can be traced and explained. The model also learns to self-refine through feedback loops, improving its reasoning capabilities over time.
  We evaluate our approach on several public and private datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in comparison to traditional video-based stress detection methods. Additionally, we provide comprehensive insights into the interpretability of the model's predictions, making the system highly valuable for applications in both healthcare and human-computer interaction domains.</description>

      <title>VERITAS-NLI : Validation and Extraction of Reliable Information Through Automated Scraping and Natural Language Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's day and age where information is rapidly spread through online platforms, the rise of fake news poses an alarming threat to the integrity of public discourse, societal trust, and reputed news sources. Classical machine learning and Transformer-based models have been extensively studied for the task of fake news detection, however they are hampered by their reliance on training data and are unable to generalize on unseen headlines. To address these challenges, we propose our novel solution, leveraging web-scraping techniques and Natural Language Inference (NLI) models to retrieve external knowledge necessary for verifying the accuracy of a headline. Our system is evaluated on a diverse self-curated evaluation dataset spanning over multiple news channels and broad domains. Our best performing pipeline achieves an accuracy of 84.3% surpassing the best classical Machine Learning model by 33.3% and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) by 31.0% . This highlights the efficacy of combining dynamic web-scraping with Natural Language Inference to find support for a claimed headline in the corresponding externally retrieved knowledge for the task of fake news detection.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Visual-Language Alignment of the Q-Former for Visual Reasoning Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated enhanced capabilities in visual reasoning tasks by employing additional encoders for aligning different modalities. While the Q-Former has been widely used as a general encoder for aligning several modalities including image, video, audio, and 3D with large language models, previous works on its efficient training and the analysis of its individual components have been limited. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) the Q-Former using InstructBLIP with visual reasoning benchmarks ScienceQA and IconQA. We observe that applying PEFT to the Q-Former achieves comparable performance to full fine-tuning using under 2% of the trainable parameters. Additionally, we employ AdaLoRA for dynamic parameter budget reallocation to examine the relative importance of the Q-Former's sublayers with 4 different benchmarks. Our findings reveal that the self-attention layers are noticeably more important in perceptual visual-language reasoning tasks, and relative importance of FFN layers depends on the complexity of visual-language patterns involved in tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/AttentionX/InstructBLIP_PEFT.</description>

      <title>AERA Chat: An Interactive Platform for Automated Explainable Student Answer Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating rationales that justify scoring decisions has emerged as a promising approach to enhance explainability in the development of automated scoring systems. However, the scarcity of publicly available rationale data and the high cost of annotation have resulted in existing methods typically relying on noisy rationales generated by large language models (LLMs). To address these challenges, we have developed AERA Chat, an interactive platform, to provide visually explained assessment of student answers and streamline the verification of rationales. Users can input questions and student answers to obtain automated, explainable assessment results from LLMs. The platform's innovative visualization features and robust evaluation tools make it useful for educators to assist their marking process, and for researchers to evaluate assessment performance and quality of rationales generated by different LLMs, or as a tool for efficient annotation. We evaluated three rationale generation approaches on our platform to demonstrate its capability.</description>

      <title>CollabEdit: Towards Non-destructive Collaborative Knowledge Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative learning of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a new paradigm for utilizing private data from different parties to guarantee efficiency and privacy. Meanwhile, Knowledge Editing (KE) for LLMs has also garnered increased attention due to its ability to manipulate the behaviors of LLMs explicitly, yet leaves the collaborative KE case (in which knowledge edits of multiple parties are aggregated in a privacy-preserving and continual manner) unexamined. To this end, this manuscript dives into the first investigation of collaborative KE, in which we start by carefully identifying the unique three challenges therein, including knowledge overlap, knowledge conflict, and knowledge forgetting. We then propose a non-destructive collaborative KE framework, COLLABEDIT, which employs a novel model merging mechanism to mimic the global KE behavior while preventing the severe performance drop. Extensive experiments on two canonical datasets demonstrate the superiority of COLLABEDIT compared to other destructive baselines, and results shed light on addressing three collaborative KE challenges and future applications.</description>

      <title>Emphasis Rendering for Conversational Text-to-Speech with Multi-modal Multi-scale Context Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational Text-to-Speech (CTTS) aims to accurately express an utterance with the appropriate style within a conversational setting, which attracts more attention nowadays. While recognizing the significance of the CTTS task, prior studies have not thoroughly investigated speech emphasis expression, which is essential for conveying the underlying intention and attitude in human-machine interaction scenarios, due to the scarcity of conversational emphasis datasets and the difficulty in context understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel Emphasis Rendering scheme for the CTTS model, termed ER-CTTS, that includes two main components: 1) we simultaneously take into account textual and acoustic contexts, with both global and local semantic modeling to understand the conversation context comprehensively; 2) we deeply integrate multi-modal and multi-scale context to learn the influence of context on the emphasis expression of the current utterance. Finally, the inferred emphasis feature is fed into the neural speech synthesizer to generate conversational speech. To address data scarcity, we create emphasis intensity annotations on the existing conversational dataset (DailyTalk). Both objective and subjective evaluations suggest that our model outperforms the baseline models in emphasis rendering within a conversational setting. The code and audio samples are available at https://github.com/CodeStoreTTS/ER-CTTS.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the evolving NLP landscape, benchmarks serve as yardsticks for gauging progress. However, existing Legal NLP benchmarks only focus on predictive tasks, overlooking generative tasks. This work curates LexSumm, a benchmark designed for evaluating legal summarization tasks in English. It comprises eight English legal summarization datasets, from diverse jurisdictions, such as the US, UK, EU and India. Additionally, we release LexT5, legal oriented sequence-to-sequence model, addressing the limitation of the existing BERT-style encoder-only models in the legal domain. We assess its capabilities through zero-shot probing on LegalLAMA and fine-tuning on LexSumm. Our analysis reveals abstraction and faithfulness errors even in summaries generated by zero-shot LLMs, indicating opportunities for further improvements. LexSumm benchmark and LexT5 model are available at https://github.com/TUMLegalTech/LexSumm-LexT5.</description>

      <title>LINKED: Eliciting, Filtering and Integrating Knowledge in Large Language Model for Commonsense Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) sometimes demonstrate poor performance on knowledge-intensive tasks, commonsense reasoning is one of them. Researchers typically address these issues by retrieving related knowledge from knowledge graphs or employing self-enhancement methods to elicit knowledge in LLMs. However, noisy knowledge and invalid reasoning issues hamper their ability to answer questions accurately. To this end, we propose a novel method named eliciting, filtering and integrating knowledge in large language model (LINKED). In it, we design a reward model to filter out the noisy knowledge and take the marginal consistent reasoning module to reduce invalid reasoning. With our comprehensive experiments on two complex commonsense reasoning benchmarks, our method outperforms SOTA baselines (up to 9.0% improvement of accuracy). Besides, to measure the positive and negative impact of the injected knowledge, we propose a new metric called effectiveness-preservation score for the knowledge enhancement works. Finally, through extensive experiments, we conduct an in-depth analysis and find many meaningful conclusions about LLMs in commonsense reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>MIRAGE: Evaluating and Explaining Inductive Reasoning Process in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inductive reasoning is an essential capability for large language models (LLMs) to achieve higher intelligence, which requires the model to generalize rules from observed facts and then apply them to unseen examples. We present {\scshape Mirage}, a synthetic dataset that addresses the limitations of previous work, specifically the lack of comprehensive evaluation and flexible test data. In it, we evaluate LLMs' capabilities in both the inductive and deductive stages, allowing for flexible variation in input distribution, task scenario, and task difficulty to analyze the factors influencing LLMs' inductive reasoning. Based on these multi-faceted evaluations, we demonstrate that the LLM is a poor rule-based reasoner. In many cases, when conducting inductive reasoning, they do not rely on a correct rule to answer the unseen case. From the perspectives of different prompting methods, observation numbers, and task forms, models tend to consistently conduct correct deduction without correct inductive rules. Besides, we find that LLMs are good neighbor-based reasoners. In the inductive reasoning process, the model tends to focus on observed facts that are close to the current test example in feature space. By leveraging these similar examples, the model maintains strong inductive capabilities within a localized region, significantly improving its deductive performance.</description>

      <title>A Speaker Turn-Aware Multi-Task Adversarial Network for Joint User Satisfaction Estimation and Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User Satisfaction Estimation is an important task and increasingly being applied in goal-oriented dialogue systems to estimate whether the user is satisfied with the service. It is observed that whether the user's needs are met often triggers various sentiments, which can be pertinent to the successful estimation of user satisfaction, and vice versa. Thus, User Satisfaction Estimation (USE) and Sentiment Analysis (SA) should be treated as a joint, collaborative effort, considering the strong connections between the sentiment states of speakers and the user satisfaction. Existing joint learning frameworks mainly unify the two highly pertinent tasks over cascade or shared-bottom implementations, however they fail to distinguish task-specific and common features, which will produce sub-optimal utterance representations for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Speaker Turn-Aware Multi-Task Adversarial Network (STMAN) for dialogue-level USE and utterance-level SA. Specifically, we first introduce a multi-task adversarial strategy which trains a task discriminator to make utterance representation more task-specific, and then utilize a speaker-turn aware multi-task interaction strategy to extract the common features which are complementary to each task. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world service dialogue datasets show that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Extended Japanese Commonsense Morality Dataset with Masked Token and Label Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have made it crucial to integrate moral reasoning into AI systems. However, existing models and datasets often overlook regional and cultural differences. To address this shortcoming, we have expanded the JCommonsenseMorality (JCM) dataset, the only publicly available dataset focused on Japanese morality. The Extended JCM (eJCM) has grown from the original 13,975 sentences to 31,184 sentences using our proposed sentence expansion method called Masked Token and Label Enhancement (MTLE). MTLE selectively masks important parts of sentences related to moral judgment and replaces them with alternative expressions generated by a large language model (LLM), while re-assigning appropriate labels. The model trained using our eJCM achieved an F1 score of 0.857, higher than the scores for the original JCM (0.837), ChatGPT one-shot classification (0.841), and data augmented using AugGPT, a state-of-the-art augmentation method (0.850). Specifically, in complex moral reasoning tasks unique to Japanese culture, the model trained with eJCM showed a significant improvement in performance (increasing from 0.681 to 0.756) and achieved a performance close to that of GPT-4 Turbo (0.787). These results demonstrate the validity of the eJCM dataset and the importance of developing models and datasets that consider the cultural context.</description>

      <title>Are You Human? An Adversarial Benchmark to Expose LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated an alarming ability to impersonate humans in conversation, raising concerns about their potential misuse in scams and deception. Humans have a right to know if they are conversing to an LLM. We evaluate text-based prompts designed as challenges to expose LLM imposters in real-time. To this end we compile and release an open-source benchmark dataset that includes 'implicit challenges' that exploit an LLM's instruction-following mechanism to cause role deviation, and 'exlicit challenges' that test an LLM's ability to perform simple tasks typically easy for humans but difficult for LLMs. Our evaluation of 9 leading models from the LMSYS leaderboard revealed that explicit challenges successfully detected LLMs in 78.4% of cases, while implicit challenges were effective in 22.9% of instances. User studies validate the real-world applicability of our methods, with humans outperforming LLMs on explicit challenges (78% vs 22% success rate). Our framework unexpectedly revealed that many study participants were using LLMs to complete tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting both AI impostors and human misuse of AI tools. This work addresses the critical need for reliable, real-time LLM detection methods in high-stakes conversations.</description>

      <title>The Future of Learning in the Age of Generative AI: Automated Question Generation and Assessment with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) and generative AI have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), offering unprecedented capabilities in education. This chapter explores the transformative potential of LLMs in automated question generation and answer assessment. It begins by examining the mechanisms behind LLMs, emphasizing their ability to comprehend and generate human-like text. The chapter then discusses methodologies for creating diverse, contextually relevant questions, enhancing learning through tailored, adaptive strategies. Key prompting techniques, such as zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting, are evaluated for their effectiveness in generating high-quality questions, including open-ended and multiple-choice formats in various languages. Advanced NLP methods like fine-tuning and prompt-tuning are explored for their role in generating task-specific questions, despite associated costs. The chapter also covers the human evaluation of generated questions, highlighting quality variations across different methods and areas for improvement. Furthermore, it delves into automated answer assessment, demonstrating how LLMs can accurately evaluate responses, provide constructive feedback, and identify nuanced understanding or misconceptions. Examples illustrate both successful assessments and areas needing improvement. The discussion underscores the potential of LLMs to replace costly, time-consuming human assessments when appropriately guided, showcasing their advanced understanding and reasoning capabilities in streamlining educational processes.</description>

      <title>SAPIENT: Mastering Multi-turn Conversational Recommendation with Strategic Planning and Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) proactively engage users in interactive dialogues to elicit user preferences and provide personalized recommendations. Existing methods train Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based agent with greedy action selection or sampling strategy, and may suffer from suboptimal conversational planning. To address this, we present a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based CRS framework SAPIENT. SAPIENT consists of a conversational agent (S-agent) and a conversational planner (S-planner). S-planner builds a conversational search tree with MCTS based on the initial actions proposed by S-agent to find conversation plans. The best conversation plans from S-planner are used to guide the training of S-agent, creating a self-training loop where S-agent can iteratively improve its capability for conversational planning. Furthermore, we propose an efficient variant SAPIENT-e for trade-off between training efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that SAPIENT outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Toward General Instruction-Following Alignment for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following natural instructions is crucial for the effective application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Despite recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), research on assessing and improving instruction-following (IF) alignment within the RAG domain remains limited. To address this issue, we propose VIF-RAG, the first automated, scalable, and verifiable synthetic pipeline for instruction-following alignment in RAG systems. We start by manually crafting a minimal set of atomic instructions (&lt;100) and developing combination rules to synthesize and verify complex instructions for a seed set. We then use supervised models for instruction rewriting while simultaneously generating code to automate the verification of instruction quality via a Python executor. Finally, we integrate these instructions with extensive RAG and general data samples, scaling up to a high-quality VIF-RAG-QA dataset (&gt;100k) through automated processes. To further bridge the gap in instruction-following auto-evaluation for RAG systems, we introduce FollowRAG Benchmark, which includes approximately 3K test samples, covering 22 categories of general instruction constraints and four knowledge-intensive QA datasets. Due to its robust pipeline design, FollowRAG can seamlessly integrate with different RAG benchmarks. Using FollowRAG and eight widely-used IF and foundational abilities benchmarks for LLMs, we demonstrate that VIF-RAG markedly enhances LLM performance across a broad range of general instruction constraints while effectively leveraging its capabilities in RAG scenarios. Further analysis offers practical insights for achieving IF alignment in RAG systems. Our code and datasets are released at https://FollowRAG.github.io.</description>

      <title>I or Not I: Unraveling the Linguistic Echoes of Identity in Samuel Beckett's "Not I" Through Natural Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the depths of Samuel Beckett's "Not I" through advanced natural language processing techniques, this research uncovers the intricate linguistic structures that underpin the text. By analyzing word frequency, detecting emotional sentiments with a BERT-based model, and examining repetitive motifs, we unveil how Beckett's minimalist yet complex language reflects the protagonist's fragmented psyche. Our results demonstrate that recurring themes of time, memory, and existential angst are artfully woven through recursive linguistic patterns and rhythmic repetition. This innovative approach not only deepens our understanding of Beckett's stylistic contributions but also highlights his unique role in modern literature, where language transcends simple communication to explore profound existential questions.</description>

      <title>Transformer-based Language Models for Reasoning in the Description Logic ALCQ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in transformer-based language models have sparked research into their logical reasoning capabilities. Most of the benchmarks used to evaluate these models are simple: generated from short (fragments of) first-order logic sentences with only a few logical operators and quantifiers. We construct the natural language dataset, DELTA$_D$, using the expressive description logic language $\mathcal{ALCQ}$. DELTA$_D$ comprises 384K examples and increases in two dimensions: i) reasoning depth, and ii) linguistic complexity. In this way, we systematically investigate the logical reasoning capabilities of a supervised fine-tuned DeBERTa-based model and two large language models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4) with few-shot prompting. We show that the DeBERTa-based model fine-tuned on our dataset can master the entailment checking task. Moreover, the performance of GPTs can improve significantly even when a small number of samples is provided (9 shots). We open-source our code and datasets.</description>

      <title>Quebec Automobile Insurance Question-Answering With Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform outstandingly in various downstream tasks, and the use of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture has been shown to improve performance for legal question answering (Nuruzzaman and Hussain, 2020; Louis et al., 2024). However, there are limited applications in insurance questions-answering, a specific type of legal document. This paper introduces two corpora: the Quebec Automobile Insurance Expertise Reference Corpus and a set of 82 Expert Answers to Layperson Automobile Insurance Questions. Our study leverages both corpora to automatically and manually assess a GPT4-o, a state-of-the-art LLM, to answer Quebec automobile insurance questions. Our results demonstrate that, on average, using our expertise reference corpus generates better responses on both automatic and manual evaluation metrics. However, they also highlight that LLM QA is unreliable enough for mass utilization in critical areas. Indeed, our results show that between 5% to 13% of answered questions include a false statement that could lead to customer misunderstanding.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Electronic Health Records Text Summarization Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of Electronic Health Records summarization systems has revolutionized patient data management. Previous research advanced this field by adapting Large Language Models for clinical tasks, using diverse datasets to generate general EHR summaries. However, clinicians often require specific, focused summaries for quicker insights. This project builds on prior work by creating a system that generates clinician-preferred, focused summaries, improving EHR summarization for more efficient patient care. The proposed system leverages the Google Flan-T5 model to generate tailored EHR summaries based on clinician-specified topics. The approach involved fine-tuning the Flan-T5 model on an EHR question-answering dataset formatted in the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) style, which is a large-scale reading comprehension dataset with questions and answers. Fine-tuning utilized the Seq2SeqTrainer from the Hugging Face Transformers library with optimized hyperparameters. Key evaluation metrics demonstrated promising results: the system achieved an Exact Match (EM) score of 81.81%. ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) metrics showed strong performance, with ROUGE-1 at 96.03%, ROUGE-2 at 86.67%, and ROUGE-L at 96.10%. Additionally, the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score was 63%, reflecting the model's coherence in generating summaries. By enhancing EHR summarization through LLMs, this project supports digital transformation efforts in healthcare, streamlining workflows, and enabling more personalized patient care.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Knowledge Ingestion: Towards Knowledge Refinement and Injection for Enhancing Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are proficient in capturing factual knowledge across various domains. However, refining their capabilities on previously seen knowledge or integrating new knowledge from external sources remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel synthetic knowledge ingestion method called Ski, which leverages fine-grained synthesis, interleaved generation, and assemble augmentation strategies to construct high-quality data representations from raw knowledge sources. We then integrate Ski and its variations with three knowledge injection techniques: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT), and Continual Pre-training (CPT) to inject and refine knowledge in language models. Extensive empirical experiments are conducted on various question-answering tasks spanning finance, biomedicine, and open-generation domains to demonstrate that Ski significantly outperforms baseline methods by facilitating effective knowledge injection. We believe that our work is an important step towards enhancing the factual accuracy of LLM outputs by refining knowledge representation and injection capabilities.</description>

      <title>Society of Medical Simplifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical text simplification is crucial for making complex biomedical literature more accessible to non-experts. Traditional methods struggle with the specialized terms and jargon of medical texts, lacking the flexibility to adapt the simplification process dynamically. In contrast, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) present unique opportunities by offering enhanced control over text simplification through iterative refinement and collaboration between specialized agents. In this work, we introduce the Society of Medical Simplifiers, a novel LLM-based framework inspired by the "Society of Mind" (SOM) philosophy. Our approach leverages the strengths of LLMs by assigning five distinct roles, i.e., Layperson, Simplifier, Medical Expert, Language Clarifier, and Redundancy Checker, organized into interaction loops. This structure allows the agents to progressively improve text simplification while maintaining the complexity and accuracy of the original content. Evaluations on the Cochrane text simplification dataset demonstrate that our framework is on par with or outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior readability and content preservation through controlled simplification processes.</description>

      <title>SciGisPy: a Novel Metric for Biomedical Text Simplification via Gist Inference Score</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomedical literature is often written in highly specialized language, posing significant comprehension challenges for non-experts. Automatic text simplification (ATS) offers a solution by making such texts more accessible while preserving critical information. However, evaluating ATS for biomedical texts is still challenging due to the limitations of existing evaluation metrics. General-domain metrics like SARI, BLEU, and ROUGE focus on surface-level text features, and readability metrics like FKGL and ARI fail to account for domain-specific terminology or assess how well the simplified text conveys core meanings (gist). To address this, we introduce SciGisPy, a novel evaluation metric inspired by Gist Inference Score (GIS) from Fuzzy-Trace Theory (FTT). SciGisPy measures how well a simplified text facilitates the formation of abstract inferences (gist) necessary for comprehension, especially in the biomedical domain. We revise GIS for this purpose by introducing domain-specific enhancements, including semantic chunking, Information Content (IC) theory, and specialized embeddings, while removing unsuitable indexes. Our experimental evaluation on the Cochrane biomedical text simplification dataset demonstrates that SciGisPy outperforms the original GIS formulation, with a significant increase in correctly identified simplified texts (84% versus 44.8%). The results and a thorough ablation study confirm that SciGisPy better captures the essential meaning of biomedical content, outperforming existing approaches.</description>

      <title>RepMatch: Quantifying Cross-Instance Similarities in Representation Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in dataset analysis techniques have enabled more sophisticated approaches to analyzing and characterizing training data instances, often categorizing data based on attributes such as ``difficulty''. In this work, we introduce RepMatch, a novel method that characterizes data through the lens of similarity. RepMatch quantifies the similarity between subsets of training instances by comparing the knowledge encoded in models trained on them, overcoming the limitations of existing analysis methods that focus solely on individual instances and are restricted to within-dataset analysis. Our framework allows for a broader evaluation, enabling similarity comparisons across arbitrary subsets of instances, supporting both dataset-to-dataset and instance-to-dataset analyses. We validate the effectiveness of RepMatch across multiple NLP tasks, datasets, and models. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that RepMatch can effectively compare datasets, identify more representative subsets of a dataset (that lead to better performance than randomly selected subsets of equivalent size), and uncover heuristics underlying the construction of some challenge datasets.</description>

      <title>Adapters for Altering LLM Vocabularies: What Languages Benefit the Most?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vocabulary adaptation, which integrates new vocabulary into pre-trained language models (LMs), enables expansion to new languages and mitigates token over-fragmentation. However, existing approaches are limited by their reliance on heuristic or external embeddings. We propose VocADT, a novel method for vocabulary adaptation using adapter modules that are trained to learn the optimal linear combination of existing embeddings while keeping the model's weights fixed. VocADT offers a flexible and scalable solution without requiring external resources or language constraints. Across 11 languages-with various scripts, resource availability, and fragmentation-we demonstrate that VocADT outperforms the original Mistral model and other baselines across various multilingual tasks. We find that Latin-script languages and highly fragmented languages benefit the most from vocabulary adaptation. We further fine-tune the adapted model on the generative task of machine translation and find that vocabulary adaptation is still beneficial after fine-tuning and that VocADT is the most effective method.</description>

      <title>COrAL: Order-Agnostic Language Modeling for Efficient Iterative Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iterative refinement has emerged as an effective paradigm for enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. However, existing approaches typically implement iterative refinement at the application or prompting level, relying on autoregressive (AR) modeling. The sequential token generation in AR models can lead to high inference latency. To overcome these challenges, we propose Context-Wise Order-Agnostic Language Modeling (COrAL), which incorporates iterative refinement directly into the LLM architecture while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach models multiple token dependencies within manageable context windows, enabling the model to perform iterative refinement internally during the generation process. Leveraging the order-agnostic nature of COrAL, we introduce sliding blockwise order-agnostic decoding, which performs multi-token forward prediction and backward reconstruction within context windows. This allows the model to iteratively refine its outputs in parallel in the sliding block, effectively capturing diverse dependencies without the high inference cost of sequential generation. Empirical evaluations on reasoning tasks demonstrate that COrAL improves performance and inference speed, respectively, achieving absolute accuracy gains of $4.6\%$ on GSM8K and $4.0\%$ on LogiQA, along with inference speedups of up to $3.9\times$ over next-token baselines. Preliminary results on code generation indicate a drop in pass rates due to inconsistencies in order-agnostic outputs, highlighting the inherent quality--speed trade-off. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/YuxiXie/COrAL.</description>

      <title>Honest AI: Fine-Tuning "Small" Language Models to Say "I Don't Know", and Reducing Hallucination in RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucination is a key roadblock for applications of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for enterprise applications that are sensitive to information accuracy. To address this issue, two general approaches have been explored: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to supply LLMs with updated information as context, and fine-tuning the LLMs with new information and desired output styles. In this paper, we propose Honest AI: a novel strategy to fine-tune "small" language models to say "I don't know" to reduce hallucination, along with several alternative RAG approaches. The solution ranked 1st in Task 2 for the false premise question. The alternative approaches include using RAG with search engine and knowledge graph results, fine-tuning base LLMs with new information and combinations of both approaches. Although all approaches improve the performance of the LLMs, RAG alone does not significantly improve the performance and fine-tuning is needed for better results. Finally, the hybrid approach achieved the highest score in the CRAG benchmark. In addition, our approach emphasizes the use of relatively small models with fewer than 10 billion parameters, promoting resource efficiency.</description>

      <title>Taming Overconfidence in LLMs: Reward Calibration in RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language model calibration refers to the alignment between the confidence of the model and the actual performance of its responses. While previous studies point out the overconfidence phenomenon in Large Language Models (LLMs) and show that LLMs trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are overconfident with a more sharpened output probability, in this study, we reveal that RLHF tends to lead models to express verbalized overconfidence in their own responses. We investigate the underlying cause of this overconfidence and demonstrate that reward models used for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) exhibit inherent biases towards high-confidence scores regardless of the actual quality of responses. Building upon this insight, we propose two PPO variants: PPO-M: PPO with Calibrated Reward Modeling and PPO-C: PPO with Calibrated Reward Calculation. PPO-M integrates explicit confidence scores in reward model training, which calibrates reward models to better capture the alignment between response quality and verbalized confidence. PPO-C adjusts the reward score during PPO based on the difference between the current reward and the moving average of past rewards. Both PPO-M and PPO-C can be seamlessly integrated into the current PPO pipeline and do not require additional golden labels. We evaluate our methods on both Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B across six diverse datasets including multiple-choice and open-ended generation. Experiment results demonstrate that both of our methods can reduce calibration error and maintain performance comparable to standard PPO. We further show that they do not compromise model capabilities in open-ended conversation settings.</description>

      <title>Empirical Study of Mutual Reinforcement Effect and Application in Few-shot Text Classification Tasks via Prompt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mutual Reinforcement Effect (MRE) investigates the synergistic relationship between word-level and text-level classifications in text classification tasks. It posits that the performance of both classification levels can be mutually enhanced. However, this mechanism has not been adequately demonstrated or explained in prior research. To address this gap, we employ empirical experiment to observe and substantiate the MRE theory. Our experiments on 21 MRE mix datasets revealed the presence of MRE in the model and its impact. Specifically, we conducted compare experiments use fine-tune. The results of findings from comparison experiments corroborates the existence of MRE. Furthermore, we extended the application of MRE to prompt learning, utilizing word-level information as a verbalizer to bolster the model's prediction of text-level classification labels. In our final experiment, the F1-score significantly surpassed the baseline in 18 out of 21 MRE Mix datasets, further validating the notion that word-level information enhances the language model's comprehension of the text as a whole.</description>

      <title>'Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?' Who will watch the watchmen? On Detecting AI-generated peer-reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integrity of the peer-review process is vital for maintaining scientific rigor and trust within the academic community. With the steady increase in the usage of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in academic writing, there is a growing concern that AI-generated texts could compromise scientific publishing, including peer-reviews. Previous works have focused on generic AI-generated text detection or have presented an approach for estimating the fraction of peer-reviews that can be AI-generated. Our focus here is to solve a real-world problem by assisting the editor or chair in determining whether a review is written by ChatGPT or not. To address this, we introduce the Term Frequency (TF) model, which posits that AI often repeats tokens, and the Review Regeneration (RR) model, which is based on the idea that ChatGPT generates similar outputs upon re-prompting. We stress test these detectors against token attack and paraphrasing. Finally, we propose an effective defensive strategy to reduce the effect of paraphrasing on our models. Our findings suggest both our proposed methods perform better than the other AI text detectors. Our RR model is more robust, although our TF model performs better than the RR model without any attacks. We make our code, dataset, and model public.</description>

      <title>A Mixed-Language Multi-Document News Summarization Dataset and a Graphs-Based Extract-Generate Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing research on news summarization primarily focuses on single-language single-document (SLSD), single-language multi-document (SLMD) or cross-language single-document (CLSD). However, in real-world scenarios, news about a international event often involves multiple documents in different languages, i.e., mixed-language multi-document (MLMD). Therefore, summarizing MLMD news is of great significance. However, the lack of datasets for MLMD news summarization has constrained the development of research in this area. To fill this gap, we construct a mixed-language multi-document news summarization dataset (MLMD-news), which contains four different languages and 10,992 source document cluster and target summary pairs. Additionally, we propose a graph-based extract-generate model and benchmark various methods on the MLMD-news dataset and publicly release our dataset and code\footnote[1]{https://github.com/Southnf9/MLMD-news}, aiming to advance research in summarization within MLMD scenarios.</description>

      <title>Expanding Search Space with Diverse Prompting Agents: An Efficient Sampling Approach for LLM Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in many complex tasks including mathematical reasoning. However, traditional approaches heavily rely on ensuring self-consistency within single prompting method, which limits the exploration of diverse problem-solving strategies. This study addresses these limitations by performing an experimental analysis of distinct prompting methods within the domain of mathematical reasoning. Our findings demonstrate that each method explores a distinct search space, and this differentiation becomes more evident with increasing problem complexity. To leverage this phenomenon, we applied efficient sampling process that uniformly combines samples from these diverse methods, which not only expands the maximum search space but achieves higher performance with fewer runs compared to single methods. Especially, within the subset of difficult questions of MATH dataset named MATH-hard, The maximum search space was achieved while utilizing approximately 43% fewer runs than single methods on average. These findings highlight the importance of integrating diverse problem-solving strategies to enhance the reasoning abilities of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Single Ground Truth Is Not Enough: Add Linguistic Variability to Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is the challenging task of extracting sentiment along with its corresponding aspects and opinions from human language. Due to the inherent variability of natural language, aspect and opinion terms can be expressed in various surface forms, making their accurate identification complex. Current evaluation methods for this task often restrict answers to a single ground truth, penalizing semantically equivalent predictions that differ in surface form. To address this limitation, we propose a novel, fully automated pipeline that augments existing test sets with alternative valid responses for aspect and opinion terms. This approach enables a fairer assessment of language models by accommodating linguistic diversity, resulting in higher human agreement than single-answer test sets (up to 10%p improvement in Kendall's Tau score). Our experimental results demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) show substantial performance improvements over T5 models when evaluated using our augmented test set, suggesting that LLMs' capabilities in ABSA tasks may have been underestimated. This work contributes to a more comprehensive evaluation framework for ABSA, potentially leading to more accurate assessments of model performance in information extraction tasks, particularly those involving span extraction.</description>

      <title>Reverse Modeling in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans are accustomed to reading and writing in a forward manner, and this natural bias extends to text understanding in auto-regressive large language models (LLMs). This paper investigates whether LLMs, like humans, struggle with reverse modeling, specifically with reversed text inputs. We found that publicly available pre-trained LLMs cannot understand such inputs. However, LLMs trained from scratch with both forward and reverse texts can understand them equally well during inference. Our case study shows that different-content texts result in different losses if input (to LLMs) in different directions -- some get lower losses for forward while some for reverse. This leads us to a simple and nice solution for data selection based on the loss differences between forward and reverse directions. Using our selected data in continued pretraining can boost LLMs' performance by a large margin across different language understanding benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic and Textual Graph Generation Via Large-Scale LLM-based Agent Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental task that has been extensively studied in social, technological, and scientific analysis. For modeling the dynamic graph evolution process, traditional rule-based methods struggle to capture community structures within graphs, while deep learning methods only focus on fitting training graphs. This limits existing graph generators to producing graphs that adhere to predefined rules or closely resemble training datasets, achieving poor performance in dynamic graph generation. Given that graphs are abstract representations arising from pairwise interactions in human activities, a realistic simulation of human-wise interaction could provide deeper insights into the graph evolution mechanism. With the increasing recognition of large language models (LLMs) in simulating human behavior, we introduce GraphAgent-Generator (GAG), a novel simulation-based framework for dynamic graph generation. Without training or fine-tuning process of LLM, our framework effectively replicates seven macro-level structural characteristics in established network science theories while surpassing existing baselines in graph expansion tasks by 31\% on specific evaluation metrics. Through node classification task, we validate GAG effectively preserves characteristics of real-world network for node-wise textual features in generated text-rich graph. Furthermore, by incorporating parallel acceleration, GAG supports generating graphs with up to nearly 100,000 nodes or 10 million edges through large-scale LLM-based agent simulation, with a minimum speed-up of 90.4\%.

      <description>arXiv:2410.09829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems like autonomous vehicles are tested in simulation before deployment, using domain-specific programs for scenario specification. To aid the testing of autonomous vehicles in simulation, we design a natural language interface, using an instruction-following large language model, to assist a non-coding domain expert in synthesising the desired scenarios and vehicle behaviours. We show that using it to convert utterances to the symbolic program is feasible, despite the very small training dataset. Human experiments show that dialogue is critical to successful simulation generation, leading to a 4.5 times higher success rate than a generation without engaging in extended conversation.</description>

      <title>ChroKnowledge: Unveiling Chronological Knowledge of Language Models in Multiple Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted many aspects of our lives. However, assessing and ensuring their chronological knowledge remains challenging. Existing approaches fall short in addressing the accumulative nature of knowledge, often relying on a single time stamp. To overcome this, we introduce ChroKnowBench, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate chronologically accumulated knowledge across three key aspects: multiple domains, time dependency, temporal state. Our benchmark distinguishes between knowledge that evolves (e.g., scientific discoveries, amended laws) and knowledge that remain constant (e.g., mathematical truths, commonsense facts). Building on this benchmark, we present ChroKnowledge (Chronological Categorization of Knowledge), a novel sampling-based framework for evaluating and updating LLMs' non-parametric chronological knowledge. Our evaluation shows: (1) The ability of eliciting temporal knowledge varies depending on the data format that model was trained on. (2) LLMs partially recall knowledge or show a cut-off at temporal boundaries rather than recalling all aspects of knowledge correctly. Thus, we apply our ChroKnowPrompt, an in-depth prompting to elicit chronological knowledge by traversing step-by-step through the surrounding time spans. We observe that our framework successfully updates the overall knowledge across the entire timeline in both the biomedical domain (+11.9%) and the general domain (+2.8%), demonstrating its effectiveness in refining temporal knowledge. This non-parametric approach also enables knowledge updates not only in open-source models but also in proprietary LLMs, ensuring comprehensive applicability across model types. We perform a comprehensive analysis based on temporal characteristics of ChroKnowPrompt and validate the potential of various models to elicit intrinsic temporal knowledge through our method.</description>

      <title>RMB: Comprehensively Benchmarking Reward Models in LLM Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward models (RMs) guide the alignment of large language models (LLMs), steering them toward behaviors preferred by humans. Evaluating RMs is the key to better aligning LLMs. However, the current evaluation of RMs may not directly correspond to their alignment performance due to the limited distribution of evaluation data and evaluation methods that are not closely related to alignment objectives. To address these limitations, we propose RMB, a comprehensive RM benchmark that covers over 49 real-world scenarios and includes both pairwise and Best-of-N (BoN) evaluations to better reflect the effectiveness of RMs in guiding alignment optimization. We demonstrate a positive correlation between our benchmark and the downstream alignment task performance. Based on our benchmark, we conduct extensive analysis on the state-of-the-art RMs, revealing their generalization defects that were not discovered by previous benchmarks, and highlighting the potential of generative RMs. Furthermore, we delve into open questions in reward models, specifically examining the effectiveness of majority voting for the evaluation of reward models and analyzing the impact factors of generative RMs, including the influence of evaluation criteria and instructing methods. Our evaluation code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Zhou-Zoey/RMB-Reward-Model-Benchmark.</description>

      <title>Reddit is all you need: Authorship profiling for Romanian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Authorship profiling is the process of identifying an author's characteristics based on their writings. This centuries old problem has become more intriguing especially with recent developments in Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this paper, we introduce a corpus of short texts in the Romanian language, annotated with certain author characteristic keywords; to our knowledge, the first of its kind. In order to do this, we exploit a social media platform called Reddit. We leverage its thematic community-based structure (subreddits structure), which offers information about the author's background. We infer an user's demographic and some broad personal traits, such as age category, employment status, interests, and social orientation based on the subreddit and other cues. We thus obtain a 23k+ samples corpus, extracted from 100+ Romanian subreddits. We analyse our dataset, and finally, we fine-tune and evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) to prove baselines capabilities for authorship profiling using the corpus, indicating the need for further research in the field. We publicly release all our resources.</description>

      <title>Learning to Rank for Multiple Retrieval-Augmented Models through Iterative Utility Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the design of a unified search engine to serve multiple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, each with a distinct task, backbone large language model (LLM), and retrieval-augmentation strategy. We introduce an iterative approach where the search engine generates retrieval results for these RAG agents and gathers feedback on the quality of the retrieved documents during an offline phase. This feedback is then used to iteratively optimize the search engine using a novel expectation-maximization algorithm, with the goal of maximizing each agent's utility function. Additionally, we adapt this approach to an online setting, allowing the search engine to refine its behavior based on real-time individual agents feedback to better serve the results for each of them. Experiments on diverse datasets from the Knowledge-Intensive Language Tasks (KILT) benchmark demonstrates that our approach significantly on average outperforms competitive baselines across 18 RAG models. We also demonstrate that our method effectively ``personalizes'' the retrieval process for each RAG agent based on the collected feedback. Finally, we provide a comprehensive ablation study to explore various aspects of our method.</description>

      <title>State of NLP in Kenya: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kenya, known for its linguistic diversity, faces unique challenges and promising opportunities in advancing Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, particularly for its underrepresented indigenous languages. This survey provides a detailed assessment of the current state of NLP in Kenya, emphasizing ongoing efforts in dataset creation, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and speech recognition for local dialects such as Kiswahili, Dholuo, Kikuyu, and Luhya. Despite these advancements, the development of NLP in Kenya remains constrained by limited resources and tools, resulting in the underrepresentation of most indigenous languages in digital spaces. This paper uncovers significant gaps by critically evaluating the available datasets and existing NLP models, most notably the need for large-scale language models and the insufficient digital representation of Indigenous languages. We also analyze key NLP applications: machine translation, information retrieval, and sentiment analysis-examining how they are tailored to address local linguistic needs. Furthermore, the paper explores the governance, policies, and regulations shaping the future of AI and NLP in Kenya and proposes a strategic roadmap to guide future research and development efforts. Our goal is to provide a foundation for accelerating the growth of NLP technologies that meet Kenya's diverse linguistic demands.</description>

      <title>MisinfoEval: Generative AI in the Era of "Alternative Facts"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spread of misinformation on social media platforms threatens democratic processes, contributes to massive economic losses, and endangers public health. Many efforts to address misinformation focus on a knowledge deficit model and propose interventions for improving users' critical thinking through access to facts. Such efforts are often hampered by challenges with scalability, and by platform users' personal biases. The emergence of generative AI presents promising opportunities for countering misinformation at scale across ideological barriers.
  In this paper, we introduce a framework (MisinfoEval) for generating and comprehensively evaluating large language model (LLM) based misinformation interventions. We present (1) an experiment with a simulated social media environment to measure effectiveness of misinformation interventions, and (2) a second experiment with personalized explanations tailored to the demographics and beliefs of users with the goal of countering misinformation by appealing to their pre-existing values. Our findings confirm that LLM-based interventions are highly effective at correcting user behavior (improving overall user accuracy at reliability labeling by up to 41.72%). Furthermore, we find that users favor more personalized interventions when making decisions about news reliability and users shown personalized interventions have significantly higher accuracy at identifying misinformation.</description>

      <title>When Neutral Summaries are not that Neutral: Quantifying Political Neutrality in LLM-Generated News Summaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era where societal narratives are increasingly shaped by algorithmic curation, investigating the political neutrality of LLMs is an important research question. This study presents a fresh perspective on quantifying the political neutrality of LLMs through the lens of abstractive text summarization of polarizing news articles. We consider five pressing issues in current US politics: abortion, gun control/rights, healthcare, immigration, and LGBTQ+ rights. Via a substantial corpus of 20,344 news articles, our study reveals a consistent trend towards pro-Democratic biases in several well-known LLMs, with gun control and healthcare exhibiting the most pronounced biases (max polarization differences of -9.49% and -6.14%, respectively). Further analysis uncovers a strong convergence in the vocabulary of the LLM outputs for these divisive topics (55% overlap for Democrat-leaning representations, 52% for Republican). Being months away from a US election of consequence, we consider our findings important.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Summarizing customer feedback to provide actionable insights for products/services at scale is an important problem for businesses across industries. Lately, the review volumes are increasing across regions and languages, therefore the challenge of aggregating and understanding customer sentiment across multiple languages becomes increasingly vital. In this paper, we propose a novel framework involving a two-step paradigm \textit{Extract-then-Summarise}, namely MARS to revolutionise traditions and address the domain agnostic aspect-level multilingual review summarisation. Extensive automatic and human evaluation shows that our approach brings substantial improvements over abstractive baselines and efficiency to real-time systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Gender Bias of LLMs in Making Morality Judgements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in a multitude of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, these models are still not immune to limitations such as social biases, especially gender bias. This work investigates whether current closed and open-source LLMs possess gender bias, especially when asked to give moral opinions. To evaluate these models, we curate and introduce a new dataset GenMO (Gender-bias in Morality Opinions) comprising parallel short stories featuring male and female characters respectively. Specifically, we test models from the GPT family (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct, GPT-4-turbo), Llama 3 and 3.1 families (8B/70B), Mistral-7B and Claude 3 families (Sonnet and Opus). Surprisingly, despite employing safety checks, all production-standard models we tested display significant gender bias with GPT-3.5-turbo giving biased opinions in 24% of the samples. Additionally, all models consistently favour female characters, with GPT showing bias in 68-85% of cases and Llama 3 in around 81-85% instances. Additionally, our study investigates the impact of model parameters on gender bias and explores real-world situations where LLMs reveal biases in moral decision-making.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Customer Feedback for Multi-modal Insight Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Businesses can benefit from customer feedback in different modalities, such as text and images, to enhance their products and services. However, it is difficult to extract actionable and relevant pairs of text segments and images from customer feedback in a single pass. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal method that fuses image and text information in a latent space and decodes it to extract the relevant feedback segments using an image-text grounded text decoder. We also introduce a weakly-supervised data generation technique that produces training data for this task. We evaluate our model on unseen data and demonstrate that it can effectively mine actionable insights from multi-modal customer feedback, outperforming the existing baselines by $14$ points in F1 score.</description>

      <title>Safety-Aware Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a common practice for tailoring models to individual needs and preferences. The choice of datasets for fine-tuning can be diverse, introducing safety concerns regarding the potential inclusion of harmful data samples. Manually filtering or avoiding such samples, however, can be labor-intensive and subjective. To address these difficulties, we propose a novel Safety-Aware Fine-Tuning (SAFT) framework designed to automatically detect and remove potentially harmful data, by leveraging a scoring function that exploits the subspace information of harmful and benign samples. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of SAFT across different LLMs and varying contamination rates, achieving reductions in harmfulness of up to 27.8%. Going beyond, we delve into the mechanism of our approach and validate its versatility in addressing practical challenges in real-world scenarios.</description>

Abstract: The explosion of open-sourced models and Question-Answering (QA) datasets emphasizes the importance of automated QA evaluation. We studied the statistics of the existing evaluation metrics for a better understanding of their limitations. By measuring the correlation coefficients of each evaluation metric concerning human-like evaluation score, we observed the following: (1) existing metrics have a high correlation among them concerning the question type (e.g., single word, single phrase, etc.), (2) no single metric can adequately estimate the human-like evaluation. As a potential solution, we discuss how a Mixture Of Grader could potentially improve the auto QA evaluator quality.</description>

      <title>LoRE: Logit-Ranked Retriever Ensemble for Enhancing Open-Domain Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-based question answering systems often suffer from positional bias, leading to suboptimal answer generation. We propose LoRE (Logit-Ranked Retriever Ensemble), a novel approach that improves answer accuracy and relevance by mitigating positional bias. LoRE employs an ensemble of diverse retrievers, such as BM25 and sentence transformers with FAISS indexing. A key innovation is a logit-based answer ranking algorithm that combines the logit scores from a large language model (LLM), with the retrieval ranks of the passages. Experimental results on NarrativeQA, SQuAD demonstrate that LoRE significantly outperforms existing retrieval-based methods in terms of exact match and F1 scores. On SQuAD, LoRE achieves 14.5\%, 22.83\%, and 14.95\% improvements over the baselines for ROUGE-L, EM, and F1, respectively. Qualitatively, LoRE generates more relevant and accurate answers, especially for complex queries.</description>

      <title>AlphaLoRA: Assigning LoRA Experts Based on Layer Training Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), are known to enhance training efficiency in Large Language Models (LLMs). Due to the limited parameters of LoRA, recent studies seek to combine LoRA with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to boost performance across various tasks. However, inspired by the observed redundancy in traditional MoE structures, previous studies identify similar redundancy among LoRA experts within the MoE architecture, highlighting the necessity for non-uniform allocation of LoRA experts across different layers. In this paper, we leverage Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) Theory to design a fine-grained allocation strategy. Our analysis reveals that the number of experts per layer correlates with layer training quality, which exhibits significant variability across layers. Based on this, we introduce AlphaLoRA, a theoretically principled and training-free method for allocating LoRA experts to further mitigate redundancy. Experiments on three models across ten language processing and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AlphaLoRA achieves comparable or superior performance over all baselines.

      <description>arXiv:2410.10063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Folktales are linguistically very rich and culturally significant in understanding the source language. Historically, only human translation has been used for translating folklore. Therefore, the number of translated texts is very sparse, which limits access to knowledge about cultural traditions and customs. We have created a new Ukrainian-To-English parallel corpus of familiar Ukrainian folktales based on available English translations and suggested several new ones. We offer a combined domain-specific approach to building and augmenting this corpus, considering the nature of the domain and differences in the purpose of human versus machine translation. Our corpus is word and sentence-aligned, allowing for the best curation of meaning, specifically tailored for use as training data for machine translation models.</description>

      <title>RoCoFT: Efficient Finetuning of Large Language Models with Row-Column Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose RoCoFT, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for large-scale language models (LMs) based on updating only a few rows and columns of the weight matrices in transformers. Through extensive experiments with medium-size LMs like BERT and RoBERTa, and larger LMs like Bloom-7B, Llama2-7B, and Llama2-13B, we show that our method gives comparable or better accuracies than state-of-art PEFT methods while also being more memory and computation-efficient. We also study the reason behind the effectiveness of our method with tools from neural tangent kernel theory. We empirically demonstrate that our kernel, constructed using a restricted set of row and column parameters, are numerically close to the full-parameter kernel and gives comparable classification performance. Ablation studies are conducted to investigate the impact of different algorithmic choices, including the selection strategy for rows and columns as well as the optimal rank for effective implementation of our method.</description>

      <title>How to Leverage Demonstration Data in Alignment for Large Language Model? A Self-Imitation Learning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel generalized self-imitation learning ($\textbf{GSIL}$) framework, which effectively and efficiently aligns large language models with offline demonstration data. We develop $\textbf{GSIL}$ by deriving a surrogate objective of imitation learning with density ratio estimates, facilitating the use of self-generated data and optimizing the imitation learning objective with simple classification losses. $\textbf{GSIL}$ eliminates the need for complex adversarial training in standard imitation learning, achieving lightweight and efficient fine-tuning for large language models. In addition, $\textbf{GSIL}$ encompasses a family of offline losses parameterized by a general class of convex functions for density ratio estimation and enables a unified view for alignment with demonstration data. Extensive experiments show that $\textbf{GSIL}$ consistently and significantly outperforms baselines in many challenging benchmarks, such as coding (HuamnEval), mathematical reasoning (GSM8K) and instruction-following benchmark (MT-Bench).</description>

      <title>FormalAlign: Automated Alignment Evaluation for Autoformalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoformalization aims to convert informal mathematical proofs into machine-verifiable formats, bridging the gap between natural and formal languages. However, ensuring semantic alignment between the informal and formalized statements remains challenging. Existing approaches heavily rely on manual verification, hindering scalability. To address this, we introduce \textsc{FormalAlign}, the first automated framework designed for evaluating the alignment between natural and formal languages in autoformalization. \textsc{FormalAlign} trains on both the autoformalization sequence generation task and the representational alignment between input and output, employing a dual loss that combines a pair of mutually enhancing autoformalization and alignment tasks. Evaluated across four benchmarks augmented by our proposed misalignment strategies, \textsc{FormalAlign} demonstrates superior performance. In our experiments, \textsc{FormalAlign} outperforms GPT-4, achieving an Alignment-Selection Score 11.58\% higher on \forml-Basic (99.21\% vs. 88.91\%) and 3.19\% higher on MiniF2F-Valid (66.39\% vs. 64.34\%). This effective alignment evaluation significantly reduces the need for manual verification. Both the dataset and code can be accessed via~\url{https://github.com/rookie-joe/FormalAlign}.</description>

      <title>Beyond-RAG: Question Identification and Answer Generation in Real-Time Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In customer contact centers, human agents often struggle with long average handling times (AHT) due to the need to manually interpret queries and retrieve relevant knowledge base (KB) articles. While retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems using large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in industry to assist with such tasks, RAG faces challenges in real-time conversations, such as inaccurate query formulation and redundant retrieval of frequently asked questions (FAQs). To address these limitations, we propose a decision support system that can look beyond RAG by first identifying customer questions in real time. If the query matches an FAQ, the system retrieves the answer directly from the FAQ database; otherwise, it generates answers via RAG. Our approach reduces reliance on manual queries, providing responses to agents within 2 seconds. Deployed in AI-powered human-agent assist solution at Minerva CQ, this system improves efficiency, reduces AHT, and lowers operational costs. We also introduce an automated LLM-agentic workflow to identify FAQs from historical transcripts when no predefined FAQs exist.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Centric Investigation of Speculative Decoding with Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding stands as a pivotal technique to expedite inference in autoregressive (large) language models. This method employs a smaller draft model to speculate a block of tokens, which the target model then evaluates for acceptance. Despite a wealth of studies aimed at increasing the efficiency of speculative decoding, the influence of generation configurations on the decoding process remains poorly understood, especially concerning decoding temperatures. This paper delves into the effects of decoding temperatures on speculative decoding's efficacy. Beginning with knowledge distillation (KD), we first highlight the challenge of decoding at higher temperatures, and demonstrate KD in a consistent temperature setting could be a remedy. We also investigate the effects of out-of-domain testing sets with out-of-range temperatures. Building upon these findings, we take an initial step to further the speedup for speculative decoding, particularly in a high-temperature generation setting. Our work offers new insights into how generation configurations drastically affect the performance of speculative decoding, and underscores the need for developing methods that focus on diverse decoding configurations.

      <title>Jailbreak Instruction-Tuned LLMs via end-of-sentence MLP Re-weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the safety mechanisms of instruction fine-tuned large language models (LLMs). We discover that re-weighting MLP neurons can significantly compromise a model's safety, especially for MLPs in end-of-sentence inferences. We hypothesize that LLMs evaluate the harmfulness of prompts during end-of-sentence inferences, and MLP layers plays a critical role in this process. Based on this hypothesis, we develop 2 novel white-box jailbreak methods: a prompt-specific method and a prompt-general method. The prompt-specific method targets individual prompts and optimizes the attack on the fly, while the prompt-general method is pre-trained offline and can generalize to unseen harmful prompts. Our methods demonstrate robust performance across 7 popular open-source LLMs, size ranging from 2B to 72B. Furthermore, our study provides insights into vulnerabilities of instruction-tuned LLM's safety and deepens the understanding of the internal mechanisms of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Hate Speech Classification: Where Do Humans and Machines Disagree, and Why?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study uses the cosine similarity ratio, embedding regression, and manual re-annotation to diagnose hate speech classification. We begin by computing cosine similarity ratio on a dataset "Measuring Hate Speech" that contains 135,556 annotated comments on social media. This way, we show a basic use of cosine similarity as a description of hate speech content. We then diagnose hate speech classification starting from understanding the inconsistency of human annotation from the dataset. Using embedding regression as a basic diagnostic, we found that female annotators are more sensitive to racial slurs that target the black population. We perform with a more complicated diagnostic by training a hate speech classifier using a SoTA pre-trained large language model, NV-Embed-v2, to convert texts to embeddings and run a logistic regression. This classifier achieves a testing accuracy of 94%. In diagnosing where machines disagree with human annotators, we found that machines make fewer mistakes than humans despite the fact that human annotations are treated as ground truth in the training set. Machines perform better in correctly labeling long statements of facts, but perform worse in labeling short instances of swear words. We hypothesize that this is due to model alignment - while curating models at their creation prevents the models from producing obvious hate speech, it also reduces the model's ability to detect such content.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multi-Domain Adaptation of Language Models using Modular Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain-specific adaptation is critical to maximizing the performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) on one or multiple targeted tasks, especially under resource-constrained use cases, such as edge devices. However, existing methods often struggle to balance domain-specific performance, retention of general knowledge, and efficiency for training and inference. To address these challenges, we propose Modular Domain Experts (MoDE). MoDE is a mixture-of-experts architecture that augments a general PLMs with modular, domain-specialized experts. These experts are trained independently and composed together via a lightweight training process. In contrast to standard low-rank adaptation methods, each MoDE expert consists of several transformer layers which scale better with more training examples and larger parameter counts. Our evaluation demonstrates that MoDE achieves comparable target performances to full parameter fine-tuning while achieving 1.65% better retention performance. Moreover, MoDE's architecture enables flexible sharding configurations and improves training speeds by up to 38% over state-of-the-art distributed training configurations.</description>

      <title>Effi-Code: Unleashing Code Efficiency in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the use of large language models (LLMs) for code generation becomes more prevalent in software development, it is critical to enhance both the efficiency and correctness of the generated code. Existing methods and models primarily focus on the correctness of LLM-generated code, ignoring efficiency. In this work, we present Effi-Code, an approach to enhancing code generation in LLMs that can improve both efficiency and correctness. We introduce a Self-Optimization process based on Overhead Profiling that leverages open-source LLMs to generate a high-quality dataset of correct and efficient code samples. This dataset is then used to fine-tune various LLMs. Our method involves the iterative refinement of generated code, guided by runtime performance metrics and correctness checks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on the Effi-Code show significant improvements in both code correctness and efficiency across task types. For example, the pass@1 of DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B-Instruct generated code increases from \textbf{43.3\%} to \textbf{76.8\%}, and the average execution time for the same correct tasks decreases by \textbf{30.5\%}. Effi-Code offers a scalable and generalizable approach to improving code generation in AI systems, with potential applications in software development, algorithm design, and computational problem-solving. The source code of Effi-Code was released in \url{https://github.com/huangd1999/Effi-Code}.</description>

      <title>Minimum Tuning to Unlock Long Output from LLMs with High Quality Data as the Key</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models rapidly evolve to support longer context, there is a notable disparity in their capability to generate output at greater lengths. Recent study suggests that the primary cause for this imbalance may arise from the lack of data with long-output during alignment training. In light of this observation, attempts are made to re-align foundation models with data that fills the gap, which result in models capable of generating lengthy output when instructed. In this paper, we explore the impact of data-quality in tuning a model for long output, and the possibility of doing so from the starting points of human-aligned (instruct or chat) models. With careful data curation, we show that it possible to achieve similar performance improvement in our tuned models, with only a small fraction of training data instances and compute. In addition, we assess the generalizability of such approaches by applying our tuning-recipes to several models. our findings suggest that, while capacities for generating long output vary across different models out-of-the-box, our approach to tune them with high-quality data using lite compute, consistently yields notable improvement across all models we experimented on. We have made public our curated dataset for tuning long-writing capability, the implementations of model tuning and evaluation, as well as the fine-tuned models, all of which can be openly-accessed.</description>

      <title>SkillAggregation: Reference-free LLM-Dependent Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to assess NLP tasks due to their ability to generate human-like judgments. Single LLMs were used initially, however, recent work suggests using multiple LLMs as judges yields improved performance. An important step in exploiting multiple judgements is the combination stage, aggregation. Existing methods in NLP either assign equal weight to all LLM judgments or are designed for specific tasks such as hallucination detection. This work focuses on aggregating predictions from multiple systems where no reference labels are available. A new method called SkillAggregation is proposed, which learns to combine estimates from LLM judges without needing additional data or ground truth. It extends the Crowdlayer aggregation method, developed for image classification, to exploit the judge estimates during inference. The approach is compared to a range of standard aggregation methods on HaluEval-Dialogue, TruthfulQA and Chatbot Arena tasks. SkillAggregation outperforms Crowdlayer on all tasks, and yields the best performance over all approaches on the majority of tasks.</description>

      <title>ChakmaNMT: A Low-resource Machine Translation On Chakma Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geopolitical division between the indigenous Chakma population and mainstream Bangladesh creates a significant cultural and linguistic gap, as the Chakma community, mostly residing in the hill tracts of Bangladesh, maintains distinct cultural traditions and language. Developing a Machine Translation (MT) model or Chakma to Bangla could play a crucial role in alleviating this cultural-linguistic divide. Thus, we have worked on MT between CCP-BN(Chakma-Bangla) by introducing a novel dataset of 15,021 parallel samples and 42,783 monolingual samples of the Chakma Language. Moreover, we introduce a small set for Benchmarking containing 600 parallel samples between Chakma, Bangla, and English. We ran traditional and state-of-the-art models in NLP on the training set, where fine-tuning BanglaT5 with back-translation using transliteration of Chakma achieved the highest BLEU score of 17.8 and 4.41 in CCP-BN and BN-CCP respectively on the Benchmark Dataset. As far as we know, this is the first-ever work on MT for the Chakma Language. Hopefully, this research will help to bridge the gap in linguistic resources and contribute to preserving endangered languages. Our dataset link and codes will be published soon.</description>

      <title>QE-EBM: Using Quality Estimators as Energy Loss for Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has shown great promise in aligning language models with human preferences in a variety of text generation tasks, including machine translation. For translation tasks, rewards can easily be obtained from quality estimation (QE) models which can generate rewards for unlabeled data. Despite its usefulness, reinforcement learning cannot exploit the gradients with respect to the QE score. We propose QE-EBM, a method of employing quality estimators as trainable loss networks that can directly backpropagate to the NMT model. We examine our method on several low and high resource target languages with English as the source language. QE-EBM outperforms strong baselines such as REINFORCE and proximal policy optimization (PPO) as well as supervised fine-tuning for all target languages, especially low-resource target languages. Most notably, for English-to-Mongolian translation, our method achieves improvements of 2.5 BLEU, 7.1 COMET-KIWI, 5.3 COMET, and 6.4 XCOMET relative to the supervised baseline.</description>

      <title>BanglaQuAD: A Bengali Open-domain Question Answering Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bengali is the seventh most spoken language on earth, yet considered a low-resource language in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Question answering over unstructured text is a challenging NLP task as it requires understanding both question and passage. Very few researchers attempted to perform question answering over Bengali (natively pronounced as Bangla) text. Typically, existing approaches construct the dataset by directly translating them from English to Bengali, which produces noisy and improper sentence structures. Furthermore, they lack topics and terminologies related to the Bengali language and people. This paper introduces BanglaQuAD, a Bengali question answering dataset, containing 30,808 question-answer pairs constructed from Bengali Wikipedia articles by native speakers. Additionally, we propose an annotation tool that facilitates question-answering dataset construction on a local machine. A qualitative analysis demonstrates the quality of our proposed dataset.</description>

      <title>Machine Translation Evaluation Benchmark for Wu Chinese: Workflow and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a FLORES+ dataset as an evaluation benchmark for modern Wu Chinese machine translation models and showcase its compatibility with existing Wu data. Wu Chinese is mutually unintelligible with other Sinitic languages such as Mandarin and Yue (Cantonese), but uses a set of Hanzi (Chinese characters) that profoundly overlaps with others. The population of Wu speakers is the second largest among languages in China, but the language has been suffering from significant drop in usage especially among the younger generations. We identify Wu Chinese as a textually low-resource language and address challenges for its machine translation models. Our contributions include: (1) an open-source, manually translated dataset, (2) full documentations on the process of dataset creation and validation experiments, (3) preliminary tools for Wu Chinese normalization and segmentation, and (4) benefits and limitations of our dataset, as well as implications to other low-resource languages.</description>

      <title>Back-of-the-Book Index Automation for Arabic Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Back-of-the-book indexes are crucial for book readability. Their manual creation is laborious and error prone. In this paper, we consider automating back-of-the-book index extraction for Arabic books to help simplify both the creation and review tasks. Given a back-of-the-book index, we aim to check and identify the accurate occurrences of index terms relative to the associated pages. To achieve this, we first define a pool of candidates for each term by extracting all possible noun phrases from paragraphs appearing on the relevant index pages. These noun phrases, identified through part-of-speech analysis, are stored in a vector database for efficient retrieval. We use several metrics, including exact matches, lexical similarity, and semantic similarity, to determine the most appropriate occurrence. The candidate with the highest score based on these metrics is chosen as the occurrence of the term. We fine-tuned a heuristic method, that considers the above metrics and that achieves an F1-score of .966 (precision=.966, recall=.966). These excellent results open the door for future work related to automation of back-of-the-book index generation and checking.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Task Text Classification Pipeline with Natural Language Explanations: A User-Centric Evaluation in Sentiment Analysis and Offensive Language Identification in Greek Tweets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretability is a topic that has been in the spotlight for the past few years. Most existing interpretability techniques produce interpretations in the form of rules or feature importance. These interpretations, while informative, may be harder to understand for non-expert users and therefore, cannot always be considered as adequate explanations. To that end, explanations in natural language are often preferred, as they are easier to comprehend and also more presentable to end-users. This work introduces an early concept for a novel pipeline that can be used in text classification tasks, offering predictions and explanations in natural language. It comprises of two models: a classifier for labelling the text and an explanation generator which provides the explanation. The proposed pipeline can be adopted by any text classification task, given that ground truth rationales are available to train the explanation generator. Our experiments are centred around the tasks of sentiment analysis and offensive language identification in Greek tweets, using a Greek Large Language Model (LLM) to obtain the necessary explanations that can act as rationales. The experimental evaluation was performed through a user study based on three different metrics and achieved promising results for both datasets.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Semantic Variation in Text-to-Image Synthesis: A Causal Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate interpretation and visualization of human instructions are crucial for text-to-image (T2I) synthesis. However, current models struggle to capture semantic variations from word order changes, and existing evaluations, relying on indirect metrics like text-image similarity, fail to reliably assess these challenges. This often obscures poor performance on complex or uncommon linguistic patterns by the focus on frequent word combinations. To address these deficiencies, we propose a novel metric called SemVarEffect and a benchmark named SemVarBench, designed to evaluate the causality between semantic variations in inputs and outputs in T2I synthesis. Semantic variations are achieved through two types of linguistic permutations, while avoiding easily predictable literal variations. Experiments reveal that the CogView-3-Plus and Ideogram 2 performed the best, achieving a score of 0.2/1. Semantic variations in object relations are less understood than attributes, scoring 0.07/1 compared to 0.17-0.19/1. We found that cross-modal alignment in UNet or Transformers plays a crucial role in handling semantic variations, a factor previously overlooked by a focus on textual encoders. Our work establishes an effective evaluation framework that advances the T2I synthesis community's exploration of human instruction understanding.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Translation Bias and Accuracy in Multilingual Large Language Models for Cross-Language Claim Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of digital misinformation has heightened interest in using multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for fact-checking. This study systematically evaluates translation bias and the effectiveness of LLMs for cross-lingual claim verification across 15 languages from five language families: Romance, Slavic, Turkic, Indo-Aryan, and Kartvelian. Using the XFACT dataset to assess their impact on accuracy and bias, we investigate two distinct translation methods: pre-translation and self-translation. We use mBERT's performance on the English dataset as a baseline to compare language-specific accuracies. Our findings reveal that low-resource languages exhibit significantly lower accuracy in direct inference due to underrepresentation in the training data. Furthermore, larger models demonstrate superior performance in self-translation, improving translation accuracy and reducing bias. These results highlight the need for balanced multilingual training, especially in low-resource languages, to promote equitable access to reliable fact-checking tools and minimize the risk of spreading misinformation in different linguistic contexts.</description>

      <title>EasyRAG: Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework for Network Automated Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents EasyRAG, a simple, lightweight, and efficient retrieval-augmented generation framework for network automated operations. The advantages of our solution are: 1.Accurate Question Answering: We designed a straightforward RAG scheme based on (1) a specific data processing workflow (2) dual-route sparse retrieval for coarse ranking (3) LLM Reranker for reranking (4) LLM answer generation and optimization. This approach achieved first place in the GLM4 track in the preliminary round and second place in the GLM4 track in the semifinals. 2.Simple Deployment: Our method primarily consists of BM25 retrieval and BGE-reranker reranking, requiring no fine-tuning of any models, occupying minimal VRAM, easy to deploy, and highly scalable; we provide a flexible code library with various search and generation strategies, facilitating custom process implementation. 3.Efficient Inference: We designed an efficient inference acceleration scheme for the entire coarse ranking, reranking, and generation process that significantly reduces the inference latency of RAG while maintaining a good level of accuracy; each acceleration scheme can be plug-and-play into any component of the RAG process, consistently enhancing the efficiency of the RAG system. Our code and data are released at https://github.com/BUAADreamer/EasyRAG.</description>

      <title>MentalGLM Series: Explainable Large Language Models for Mental Health Analysis on Chinese Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the prevalence of mental health challenges, social media has emerged as a key platform for individuals to express their emotions.Deep learning tends to be a promising solution for analyzing mental health on social media. However, black box models are often inflexible when switching between tasks, and their results typically lack explanations. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), their flexibility has introduced new approaches to the field. Also due to the generative nature, they can be prompted to explain decision-making processes. However, their performance on complex psychological analysis still lags behind deep learning. In this paper, we introduce the first multi-task Chinese Social Media Interpretable Mental Health Instructions (C-IMHI) dataset, consisting of 9K samples, which has been quality-controlled and manually validated. We also propose MentalGLM series models, the first open-source LLMs designed for explainable mental health analysis targeting Chinese social media, trained on a corpus of 50K instructions. The proposed models were evaluated on three downstream tasks and achieved better or comparable performance compared to deep learning models, generalized LLMs, and task fine-tuned LLMs. We validated a portion of the generated decision explanations with experts, showing promising results. We also evaluated the proposed models on a clinical dataset, where they outperformed other LLMs, indicating their potential applicability in the clinical field. Our models show strong performance, validated across tasks and perspectives. The decision explanations enhance usability and facilitate better understanding and practical application of the models. Both the constructed dataset and the models are publicly available via: https://github.com/zwzzzQAQ/MentalGLM.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Hate Across Target Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hate speech (HS) classifiers do not perform equally well in detecting hateful expressions towards different target identities. They also demonstrate systematic biases in predicted hatefulness scores. Tapping on two recently proposed functionality test datasets for HS detection, we quantitatively analyze the impact of different factors on HS prediction. Experiments on popular industrial and academic models demonstrate that HS detectors assign a higher hatefulness score merely based on the mention of specific target identities. Besides, models often confuse hatefulness and the polarity of emotions. This result is worrisome as the effort to build HS detectors might harm the vulnerable identity groups we wish to protect: posts expressing anger or disapproval of hate expressions might be flagged as hateful themselves. We also carry out a study inspired by social psychology theory, which reveals that the accuracy of hatefulness prediction correlates strongly with the intensity of the stereotype.</description>

      <title>Locking Down the Finetuned LLMs Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on additional datasets is often necessary to optimize them for specific downstream tasks. However, existing safety alignment measures, which restrict harmful behavior during inference, are insufficient to mitigate safety risks during fine-tuning. Alarmingly, fine-tuning with just 10 toxic sentences can make models comply with harmful instructions. We introduce SafetyLock, a novel alignment intervention method that maintains robust safety post-fine-tuning through efficient and transferable mechanisms. SafetyLock leverages our discovery that fine-tuned models retain similar safety-related activation representations to their base models. This insight enables us to extract what we term the Meta-SafetyLock, a set of safety bias directions representing key activation patterns associated with safe responses in the original model. We can then apply these directions universally to fine-tuned models to enhance their safety. By searching for activation directions across multiple token dimensions, SafetyLock achieves enhanced robustness and transferability. SafetyLock re-aligns fine-tuned models in under 0.01 seconds without additional computational cost. Our experiments demonstrate that SafetyLock can reduce the harmful instruction response rate from 60% to below 1% in toxic fine-tuned models. It surpasses traditional methods in both performance and efficiency, offering a scalable, non-invasive solution for ensuring the safety of customized LLMs. Our analysis across various fine-tuning scenarios confirms SafetyLock's robustness, advocating its integration into safety protocols for aligned LLMs. The code is released at https://github.com/zhu-minjun/SafetyLock.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Routing and Cascading for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread applicability of large language models (LLMs) has increased the availability of many fine-tuned models of various sizes targeting specific tasks. Given a set of such specialized models, to maximize overall performance, it is important to figure out the optimal strategy for selecting the right model for a given user query. An effective strategy could drastically increase overall performance and even offer improvements over a single large monolithic model. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: routing, where a single model is selected for each query, and cascading, which runs a sequence of increasingly larger models until a satisfactory answer is obtained. However, both have notable limitations: routing commits to an initial model without flexibility, while cascading requires executing every model in sequence, which can be inefficient. Additionally, the conditions under which these strategies are provably optimal remain unclear. In this work, we derive optimal strategies for both routing and cascading. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel approach called cascade routing, which combines the adaptability of routing with the cost-efficiency of cascading. Our experiments demonstrate that cascade routing consistently outperforms both routing and cascading across a variety of settings, improving both output quality and lowering computational cost, thus offering a unified and efficient solution to the model selection problem.</description>

      <title>Augmenting In-Context-Learning in LLMs via Automatic Data Labeling and Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that Large Language Models' (LLMs) performance can be improved for many tasks using Chain of Thought (CoT) or In-Context Learning (ICL), which involve demonstrating the steps needed to solve a task using a few examples. However, while datasets with input-output pairs are relatively easy to produce, providing demonstrations which include intermediate steps requires cumbersome manual work. These steps may be executable programs, as in agentic flows, or step-by-step reasoning as in CoT. In this work, we propose Automatic Data Labeling and Refinement (ADLR), a method to automatically generate and filter demonstrations which include the above intermediate steps, starting from a small seed of manually crafted examples. We demonstrate the advantage of ADLR in code-based table QA and mathematical reasoning, achieving up to a 5.5% gain. The code implementing our method is provided in the Supplementary material and will be made available.</description>

      <title>LLM-based Code-Switched Text Generation for Grammatical Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of globalisation, code-switching (CSW) has become a ubiquitous part of multilingual conversation, posing new challenges for natural language processing (NLP), especially in Grammatical Error Correction (GEC). This work explores the complexities of applying GEC systems to CSW texts. Our objectives include evaluating the performance of state-of-the-art GEC systems on an authentic CSW dataset from English as a Second Language (ESL) learners, exploring synthetic data generation as a solution to data scarcity, and developing a model capable of correcting grammatical errors in monolingual and CSW texts. We generated synthetic CSW GEC data, resulting in one of the first substantial datasets for this task, and showed that a model trained on this data is capable of significant improvements over existing systems. This work targets ESL learners, aiming to provide educational technologies that aid in the development of their English grammatical correctness without constraining their natural multilingualism.</description>

      <title>Parenting: Optimizing Knowledge Selection of Retrieval-Augmented Language Models with Parameter Decoupling and Tailored Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an effective solution to the issues faced by Large Language Models (LLMs) in hallucination generation and knowledge obsolescence by incorporating externally retrieved knowledge. However, due to potential conflicts between internal and external knowledge, as well as retrieval noise, LLMs often struggle to effectively integrate external evidence, leading to a decline in performance. Although existing methods attempt to tackle these challenges, they often struggle to strike a balance between model adherence and robustness, resulting in significant learning variance. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we propose Parenting, a novel framework that decouples adherence and robustness within the parameter space of LLMs. Specifically, Parenting utilizes a key parameter mining method based on forward activation gain to identify and isolate the crucial parameter units that are strongly linked to adherence and robustness. Then, Parenting employs a type-guided tailored tuning strategy, applying specific and appropriate fine-tuning methods to parameter units representing different capabilities, aiming to achieve a balanced enhancement of adherence and robustness. Extensive experiments on various datasets and models validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characters are at the heart of every story, driving the plot and engaging readers. In this study, we explore the understanding of characters in full-length books, which contain complex narratives and numerous interacting characters. We define two tasks: character description, which generates a brief factual profile, and character analysis, which offers an in-depth interpretation, including character development, personality, and social context. We introduce the BookWorm dataset, pairing books from the Gutenberg Project with human-written descriptions and analyses. Using this dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art long-context models in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, utilizing both retrieval-based and hierarchical processing for book-length inputs. Our findings show that retrieval-based approaches outperform hierarchical ones in both tasks. Additionally, fine-tuned models using coreference-based retrieval produce the most factual descriptions, as measured by fact- and entailment-based metrics. We hope our dataset, experiments, and analysis will inspire further research in character-based narrative understanding.</description>

      <title>MMCFND: Multimodal Multilingual Caption-aware Fake News Detection for Low-resource Indic Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread dissemination of false information through manipulative tactics that combine deceptive text and images threatens the integrity of reliable sources of information. While there has been research on detecting fake news in high resource languages using multimodal approaches, methods for low resource Indic languages primarily rely on textual analysis. This difference highlights the need for robust methods that specifically address multimodal fake news in Indic languages, where the lack of extensive datasets and tools presents a significant obstacle to progress. To this end, we introduce the Multimodal Multilingual dataset for Indic Fake News Detection (MMIFND). This meticulously curated dataset consists of 28,085 instances distributed across Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Malayalam, Tamil, Gujarati and Punjabi. We further propose the Multimodal Multilingual Caption-aware framework for Fake News Detection (MMCFND). MMCFND utilizes pre-trained unimodal encoders and pairwise encoders from a foundational model that aligns vision and language, allowing for extracting deep representations from visual and textual components of news articles. The multimodal fusion encoder in the foundational model integrates text and image representations derived from its pairwise encoders to generate a comprehensive cross modal representation. Furthermore, we generate descriptive image captions that provide additional context to detect inconsistencies and manipulations. The retrieved features are then fused and fed into a classifier to determine the authenticity of news articles. The curated dataset can potentially accelerate research and development in low resource environments significantly. Thorough experimentation on MMIFND demonstrates that our proposed framework outperforms established methods for extracting relevant fake news detection features.</description>

      <title>Medico: Towards Hallucination Detection and Correction with Multi-source Evidence Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As we all know, hallucinations prevail in Large Language Models (LLMs), where the generated content is coherent but factually incorrect, which inflicts a heavy blow on the widespread application of LLMs. Previous studies have shown that LLMs could confidently state non-existent facts rather than answering ``I don't know''. Therefore, it is necessary to resort to external knowledge to detect and correct the hallucinated content. Since manual detection and correction of factual errors is labor-intensive, developing an automatic end-to-end hallucination-checking approach is indeed a needful thing. To this end, we present Medico, a Multi-source evidence fusion enhanced hallucination detection and correction framework. It fuses diverse evidence from multiple sources, detects whether the generated content contains factual errors, provides the rationale behind the judgment, and iteratively revises the hallucinated content. Experimental results on evidence retrieval (0.964 HR@5, 0.908 MRR@5), hallucination detection (0.927-0.951 F1), and hallucination correction (0.973-0.979 approval rate) manifest the great potential of Medico. A video demo of Medico can be found at https://youtu.be/RtsO6CSesBI.</description>

      <title>QUITE: Quantifying Uncertainty in Natural Language Text in Bayesian Reasoning Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning is key to many decision making processes. It requires consolidating a set of rule-like premises that are often associated with degrees of uncertainty and observations to draw conclusions. In this work, we address both the case where premises are specified as numeric probabilistic rules and situations in which humans state their estimates using words expressing degrees of certainty. Existing probabilistic reasoning datasets simplify the task, e.g., by requiring the model to only rank textual alternatives, by including only binary random variables, or by making use of a limited set of templates that result in less varied text.
  In this work, we present QUITE, a question answering dataset of real-world Bayesian reasoning scenarios with categorical random variables and complex relationships. QUITE provides high-quality natural language verbalizations of premises together with evidence statements and expects the answer to a question in the form of an estimated probability. We conduct an extensive set of experiments, finding that logic-based models outperform out-of-the-box large language models on all reasoning types (causal, evidential, and explaining-away). Our results provide evidence that neuro-symbolic models are a promising direction for improving complex reasoning. We release QUITE and code for training and experiments on Github.</description>

      <title>Ada-K Routing: Boosting the Efficiency of MoE-based LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures offer a promising approach to managing computational costs while scaling up model parameters. Conventional MoE-based LLMs typically employ static Top-K routing, which activates a fixed and equal number of experts for each token regardless of their significance within the context. In this paper, we propose a novel Ada-K routing strategy that dynamically adjusts the number of activated experts for each token, thereby improving the balance between computational efficiency and model performance. Specifically, our strategy incorporates learnable and lightweight allocator modules that decide customized expert resource allocation tailored to the contextual needs for each token. These allocators are designed to be fully pluggable, making it broadly applicable across all mainstream MoE-based LLMs. We leverage the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to facilitate an end-to-end learning process for this non-differentiable decision-making framework. Extensive evaluations on four popular baseline models demonstrate that our Ada-K routing method significantly outperforms conventional Top-K routing. Compared to Top-K, our method achieves over 25% reduction in FLOPs and more than 20% inference speedup while still improving performance across various benchmarks. Moreover, the training of Ada-K is highly efficient. Even for Mixtral-8x22B, a MoE-based LLM with more than 140B parameters, the training time is limited to 8 hours. Detailed analysis shows that harder tasks, middle layers, and content words tend to activate more experts, providing valuable insights for future adaptive MoE system designs. Both the training code and model checkpoints will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Will LLMs Replace the Encoder-Only Models in Temporal Relation Classification?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automatic detection of temporal relations among events has been mainly investigated with encoder-only models such as RoBERTa. Large Language Models (LLM) have recently shown promising performance in temporal reasoning tasks such as temporal question answering. Nevertheless, recent studies have tested the LLMs' performance in detecting temporal relations of closed-source models only, limiting the interpretability of those results. In this work, we investigate LLMs' performance and decision process in the Temporal Relation Classification task. First, we assess the performance of seven open and closed-sourced LLMs experimenting with in-context learning and lightweight fine-tuning approaches. Results show that LLMs with in-context learning significantly underperform smaller encoder-only models based on RoBERTa. Then, we delve into the possible reasons for this gap by applying explainable methods. The outcome suggests a limitation of LLMs in this task due to their autoregressive nature, which causes them to focus only on the last part of the sequence. Additionally, we evaluate the word embeddings of these two models to better understand their pre-training differences. The code and the fine-tuned models can be found respectively on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Cultural Fidelity in Large-Language Models: An Evaluation of Online Language Resources as a Driver of Model Performance in Value Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The training data for LLMs embeds societal values, increasing their familiarity with the language's culture. Our analysis found that 44% of the variance in the ability of GPT-4o to reflect the societal values of a country, as measured by the World Values Survey, correlates with the availability of digital resources in that language. Notably, the error rate was more than five times higher for the languages of the lowest resource compared to the languages of the highest resource. For GPT-4-turbo, this correlation rose to 72%, suggesting efforts to improve the familiarity with the non-English language beyond the web-scraped data. Our study developed one of the largest and most robust datasets in this topic area with 21 country-language pairs, each of which contain 94 survey questions verified by native speakers. Our results highlight the link between LLM performance and digital data availability in target languages. Weaker performance in low-resource languages, especially prominent in the Global South, may worsen digital divides. We discuss strategies proposed to address this, including developing multilingual LLMs from the ground up and enhancing fine-tuning on diverse linguistic datasets, as seen in African language initiatives.</description>

      <title>Everyday Speech in the Indian Subcontinent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: India has 1369 languages of which 22 are official. About 13 different scripts are used to represent these languages. A Common Label Set (CLS) was developed based on phonetics to address the issue of large vocabulary of units required in the End to End (E2E) framework for multilingual synthesis. This reduced the footprint of the synthesizer and also enabled fast adaptation to new languages which had similar phonotactics, provided language scripts belonged to the same family. In this paper, we provide new insights into speech synthesis, where the script belongs to one family, while the phonotactics comes from another. Indian language text is first converted to CLS, and then a synthesizer that matches the phonotactics of the language is used. Quality akin to that of a native speaker is obtained for Sanskrit and Konkani with zero adaptation data, using Kannada and Marathi synthesizers respectively. Further, this approach also lends itself seamless code switching across 13 Indian languages and English in a given native speaker's voice.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Legal Judgement Prediction in a Realistic Scenario in the Era of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates judgment prediction in a realistic scenario within the context of Indian judgments, utilizing a range of transformer-based models, including InLegalBERT, BERT, and XLNet, alongside LLMs such as Llama-2 and GPT-3.5 Turbo. In this realistic scenario, we simulate how judgments are predicted at the point when a case is presented for a decision in court, using only the information available at that time, such as the facts of the case, statutes, precedents, and arguments. This approach mimics real-world conditions, where decisions must be made without the benefit of hindsight, unlike retrospective analyses often found in previous studies. For transformer models, we experiment with hierarchical transformers and the summarization of judgment facts to optimize input for these models. Our experiments with LLMs reveal that GPT-3.5 Turbo excels in realistic scenarios, demonstrating robust performance in judgment prediction. Furthermore, incorporating additional legal information, such as statutes and precedents, significantly improves the outcome of the prediction task. The LLMs also provide explanations for their predictions. To evaluate the quality of these predictions and explanations, we introduce two human evaluation metrics: Clarity and Linking. Our findings from both automatic and human evaluations indicate that, despite advancements in LLMs, they are yet to achieve expert-level performance in judgment prediction and explanation tasks.</description>

      <title>Is Structure Dependence Shaped for Efficient Communication?: A Case Study on Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural language exhibits various universal properties. But why do these universals exist? One explanation is that they arise from functional pressures to achieve efficient communication, a view which attributes cross-linguistic properties to domain-general cognitive abilities. This hypothesis has successfully addressed some syntactic universal properties such as compositionality and Greenbergian word order universals. However, more abstract syntactic universals have not been explored from the perspective of efficient communication. Among such universals, the most notable one is structure dependence, that is, the existence of grammar-internal operations that crucially depend on hierarchical representations. This property has traditionally been taken to be central to natural language and to involve domain-specific knowledge irreducible to communicative efficiency.
  In this paper, we challenge the conventional view by investigating whether structure dependence realizes efficient communication, focusing on coordinate structures. We design three types of artificial languages: (i) one with a structure-dependent reduction operation, which is similar to natural language, (ii) one without any reduction operations, and (iii) one with a linear (rather than structure-dependent) reduction operation. We quantify the communicative efficiency of these languages. The results demonstrate that the language with the structure-dependent reduction operation is significantly more communicatively efficient than the counterfactual languages. This suggests that the existence of structure-dependent properties can be explained from the perspective of efficient communication.</description>

      <title>Recipe for Zero-shot POS Tagging: Is It Useful in Realistic Scenarios?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: POS tagging plays a fundamental role in numerous applications. While POS taggers are highly accurate in well-resourced settings, they lag behind in cases of limited or missing training data. This paper focuses on POS tagging for languages with limited data. We seek to identify the characteristics of datasets that make them favourable for training POS tagging models without using any labelled training data from the target language. This is a zero-shot approach. We compare the accuracies of a multilingual large language model (mBERT) fine-tuned on one or more languages related to the target language. Additionally, we compare these results with models trained directly on the target language itself. We do this for three target low-resource languages. Our research highlights the importance of accurate dataset selection for effective zero-shot POS tagging. Particularly, a strong linguistic relationship and high-quality datasets ensure optimal results. For extremely low-resource languages, zero-shot models prove to be a viable option.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Controlled Generation And Gold-Standard-Agnostic Evaluation of Code-Mixed Sentences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code-mixing, the practice of alternating between two or more languages in an utterance, is a common phenomenon in multilingual communities. Due to the colloquial nature of code-mixing, there is no singular correct way to translate an English sentence into a code-mixed sentence. For this reason, standard n-gram-based MT evaluation metrics such as the BLEU score are not appropriate for code-mixed evaluation. To demonstrate this, we propose a novel method for code-mixed text generation: Controlled Generation, which parameterizes the code-mixing degree (CMD) and enables the generation of multiple semantically equivalent code-mixed sentences from a given English sentence. We introduce a robust new evaluation metric: GAME: A Gold-Standard Agnostic Measure for Evaluation of Code-Mixed Sentences. GAME is both language-agnostic and gold-standard-agnostic, i.e. unlike other metrics, GAME does not require gold-standard code-mixed sentences for evaluation, thus eliminating the need for human annotators in the code-mixed evaluation process. When used to evaluate semantically equivalent code-mixed sentences, we find that GAME scores have a lower standard deviation than BLEU scores. Further, we create and release a dataset containing gold-standard code-mixed sentences across 4 language pairs: English-{Hindi, Bengali, French, Spanish} to encourage more computational research on code-mixing.</description>

Abstract: The paper introduces our system for SemEval-2024 Task 1, which aims to predict the relatedness of sentence pairs. Operating under the hypothesis that semantic relatedness is a broader concept that extends beyond mere similarity of sentences, our approach seeks to identify useful features for relatedness estimation. We employ an ensemble approach integrating various systems, including statistical textual features and outputs of deep learning models to predict relatedness scores. The findings suggest that semantic relatedness can be inferred from various sources and ensemble models outperform many individual systems in estimating semantic relatedness.</description>

      <title>SensorLLM: Aligning Large Language Models with Motion Sensors for Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we bridge the gap between wearable sensor technology and personalized AI assistants by enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand time-series tasks like human activity recognition (HAR). Despite the strong reasoning and generalization capabilities of LLMs, leveraging them for sensor data tasks remains largely unexplored. This gap stems from challenges like the lack of semantic context in time-series data, computational limitations, and LLMs' difficulty processing numerical inputs. To address these issues, we introduce SensorLLM, a two-stage framework to unlock LLMs' potential for sensor data tasks. In the Sensor-Language Alignment Stage, we introduce special tokens for each sensor channel and automatically generate trend-descriptive text to align sensor data with textual inputs, enabling SensorLLM to capture numerical changes, channel-specific information, and sensor data of varying lengths-capabilities that existing LLMs typically struggle with, all without the need for human annotations. Next, in Task-Aware Tuning Stage, we refine the model for HAR classification using the frozen LLM and alignment module, achieving performance on par with or surpassing state-of-the-art models. We further demonstrate that SensorLLM evolves into an effective sensor learner, reasoner, and classifier through Sensor-Language Alignment, enabling it to generalize across diverse datasets for HAR tasks. We strongly believe our work lays the stepstone for future time-series and text alignment research, offering a path toward foundation models for sensor data.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Democratizing Medical LLMs for 50 Languages via a Mixture of Language Family Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting medical Large Language Models to local languages can reduce barriers to accessing healthcare services, but data scarcity remains a significant challenge, particularly for low-resource languages. To address this, we first construct a high-quality medical dataset and conduct analysis to ensure its quality. In order to leverage the generalization capability of multilingual LLMs to efficiently scale to more resource-constrained languages, we explore the internal information flow of LLMs from a multilingual perspective using Mixture of Experts (MoE) modularity. Technically, we propose a novel MoE routing method that employs language-specific experts and cross-lingual routing. Inspired by circuit theory, our routing analysis revealed a Spread Out in the End information flow mechanism: while earlier layers concentrate cross-lingual information flow, the later layers exhibit language-specific divergence. This insight directly led to the development of the Post-MoE architecture, which applies sparse routing only in the later layers while maintaining dense others. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach enhances the generalization of multilingual models to other languages while preserving interpretability. Finally, to efficiently scale the model to 50 languages, we introduce the concept of language family experts, drawing on linguistic priors, which enables scaling the number of languages without adding additional parameters.</description>

      <title>Thinking LLMs: General Instruction Following with Thought Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs are typically trained to answer user questions or follow instructions similarly to how human experts respond. However, in the standard alignment framework they lack the basic ability of explicit thinking before answering. Thinking is important for complex questions that require reasoning and planning -- but can be applied to any task. We propose a training method for equipping existing LLMs with such thinking abilities for general instruction following without use of additional human data. We achieve this by an iterative search and optimization procedure that explores the space of possible thought generations, allowing the model to learn how to think without direct supervision. For each instruction, the thought candidates are scored using a judge model to evaluate their responses only, and then optimized via preference optimization. We show that this procedure leads to superior performance on AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard, and shows gains from thinking on non-reasoning categories such as marketing, health and general knowledge, in addition to more traditional reasoning &amp; problem-solving tasks.</description>

      <title>Double Jeopardy and Climate Impact in the Use of Large Language Models: Socio-economic Disparities and Reduced Utility for Non-English Speakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), holds the potential to bridge language and information gaps, which can benefit the economies of developing nations. However, our analysis of FLORES-200, FLORES+, Ethnologue, and World Development Indicators data reveals that these benefits largely favor English speakers. Speakers of languages in low-income and lower-middle-income countries face higher costs when using OpenAI's GPT models via APIs because of how the system processes the input -- tokenization. Around 1.5 billion people, speaking languages primarily from lower-middle-income countries, could incur costs that are 4 to 6 times higher than those faced by English speakers. Disparities in LLM performance are significant, and tokenization in models priced per token amplifies inequalities in access, cost, and utility. Moreover, using the quality of translation tasks as a proxy measure, we show that LLMs perform poorly in low-resource languages, presenting a ``double jeopardy" of higher costs and poor performance for these users. We also discuss the direct impact of fragmentation in tokenizing low-resource languages on climate. This underscores the need for fairer algorithm development to benefit all linguistic groups.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Evaluation via Matrix Nuclear-Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, efficient evaluation metrics are vital for assessing their ability to compress information and reduce redundancy. While traditional metrics like Matrix Entropy offer valuable insights, they are computationally intensive for large-scale models due to their \( O(n^3) \) time complexity with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To mitigate this issue, we introduce the Matrix Nuclear-Norm, which not only serves as a metric to quantify the data compression proficiency of LLM but also provides a convex approximation of matrix rank to capture both predictive discriminability and diversity. By employing the \( L_{1,2}\text{-norm} \) to further approximate the nuclear norm, we can effectively assess the model's information compression capabilities. This approach reduces the time complexity to \( O(n^2) \) and eliminates the need for SVD computation. Consequently, the Matrix Nuclear-Norm achieves speeds 8 to 24 times faster than Matrix Entropy for the CEREBRAS-GPT model as sizes increase from 111M to 6.7B. This performance gap becomes more pronounced with larger models, as validated in tests with other models like Pythia. Additionally, evaluations on benchmarks and model responses confirm that our proposed Matrix Nuclear-Norm is a reliable, scalable, and efficient tool for assessing LLMs' performance, striking a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

      <title>Building a Multivariate Time Series Benchmarking Datasets Inspired by Natural Language Processing (NLP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series analysis has become increasingly important in various domains, and developing effective models relies heavily on high-quality benchmark datasets. Inspired by the success of Natural Language Processing (NLP) benchmark datasets in advancing pre-trained models, we propose a new approach to create a comprehensive benchmark dataset for time series analysis. This paper explores the methodologies used in NLP benchmark dataset creation and adapts them to the unique challenges of time series data. We discuss the process of curating diverse, representative, and challenging time series datasets, highlighting the importance of domain relevance and data complexity. Additionally, we investigate multi-task learning strategies that leverage the benchmark dataset to enhance the performance of time series models. This research contributes to the broader goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in time series modeling by adopting successful strategies from the NLP domain.</description>

      <title>Derail Yourself: Multi-turn LLM Jailbreak Attack through Self-discovered Clues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study exposes the safety vulnerabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn interactions, where malicious users can obscure harmful intents across several queries. We introduce ActorAttack, a novel multi-turn attack method inspired by actor-network theory, which models a network of semantically linked actors as attack clues to generate diverse and effective attack paths toward harmful targets. ActorAttack addresses two main challenges in multi-turn attacks: (1) concealing harmful intents by creating an innocuous conversation topic about the actor, and (2) uncovering diverse attack paths towards the same harmful target by leveraging LLMs' knowledge to specify the correlated actors as various attack clues. In this way, ActorAttack outperforms existing single-turn and multi-turn attack methods across advanced aligned LLMs, even for GPT-o1. We will publish a dataset called SafeMTData, which includes multi-turn adversarial prompts and safety alignment data, generated by ActorAttack. We demonstrate that models safety-tuned using our safety dataset are more robust to multi-turn attacks. Code is available at https://github.com/renqibing/ActorAttack.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Are Active Critics in NLG Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional paradigm of using large language models (LLMs) for evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems typically relies on two key inputs: (1) a clear definition of the NLG task to be evaluated and (2) a list of pre-defined evaluation criteria. This process treats LLMs as ''passive critics,'' strictly following human-defined criteria for evaluation. However, as new NLG tasks emerge, the criteria for assessing text quality can vary greatly. Consequently, these rigid evaluation methods struggle to adapt to diverse NLG tasks without extensive prompt engineering customized for each specific task. To address this limitation, we introduce Active-Critic, a novel LLM-based NLG evaluation protocol that enables LLMs to function as ''active critics.'' Specifically, our protocol comprises two key stages. In the first stage, the LLM is instructed to infer the target NLG task and establish relevant evaluation criteria from the data. Building on this self-inferred information, the second stage dynamically optimizes the prompt to guide the LLM toward more human-aligned scoring decisions, while also generating detailed explanations to justify its evaluations. Experiments across four NLG evaluation tasks show that our approach achieves stronger alignment with human judgments than state-of-the-art evaluation methods. Our comprehensive analysis further highlights the effectiveness and explainability of Active-Critic with only a small amount of labeled data. We will share our code and data on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Balancing Continuous Pre-Training and Instruction Fine-Tuning: Optimizing Instruction-Following in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for public use require continuous pre-training to remain up-to-date with the latest data. The models also need to be fine-tuned with specific instructions to maintain their ability to follow instructions accurately. Typically, LLMs are released in two versions: the Base LLM, pre-trained on diverse data, and the instruction-refined LLM, additionally trained with specific instructions for better instruction following. The question arises as to which model should undergo continuous pre-training to maintain its instruction-following abilities while also staying current with the latest data. In this study, we delve into the intricate relationship between continuous pre-training and instruction fine-tuning of the LLMs and investigate the impact of continuous pre-training on the instruction following abilities of both the base and its instruction finetuned model. Further, the instruction fine-tuning process is computationally intense and requires a substantial number of hand-annotated examples for the model to learn effectively. This study aims to find the most compute-efficient strategy to gain up-to-date knowledge and instruction-following capabilities without requiring any instruction data and fine-tuning. We empirically prove our findings on the LLaMa 3, 3.1 and Qwen 2, 2.5 family of base and instruction models, providing a comprehensive exploration of our hypotheses across varying sizes of pre-training data corpus and different LLMs settings.</description>

      <title>Use Random Selection for Now: Investigation of Few-Shot Selection Strategies in LLM-based Text Augmentation for Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generative large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for data augmentation tasks, where text samples are paraphrased (or generated anew) and then used for classifier fine-tuning. Existing works on augmentation leverage the few-shot scenarios, where samples are given to LLMs as part of prompts, leading to better augmentations. Yet, the samples are mostly selected randomly and a comprehensive overview of the effects of other (more ``informed'') sample selection strategies is lacking. In this work, we compare sample selection strategies existing in few-shot learning literature and investigate their effects in LLM-based textual augmentation. We evaluate this on in-distribution and out-of-distribution classifier performance. Results indicate, that while some ``informed'' selection strategies increase the performance of models, especially for out-of-distribution data, it happens only seldom and with marginal performance increases. Unless further advances are made, a default of random sample selection remains a good option for augmentation practitioners.</description>

      <title>When Attention Sink Emerges in Language Models: An Empirical View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language Models (LMs) assign significant attention to the first token, even if it is not semantically important, which is known as attention sink. This phenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/long context generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, model quantization, and others. Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding of attention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate that attention sinks exist universally in LMs with various inputs, even in small models. Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LM pre-training, motivating us to investigate how optimization, data distribution, loss function, and model architecture in LM pre-training influence its emergence. We highlight that attention sink emerges after effective optimization on sufficient training data. The sink position is highly correlated with the loss function and data distribution. Most importantly, we find that attention sink acts more like key biases, storing extra attention scores, which could be non-informative and not contribute to the value computation. We also observe that this phenomenon (at least partially) stems from tokens' inner dependence on attention scores as a result of softmax normalization. After relaxing such dependence by replacing softmax attention with other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention without normalization, attention sinks do not emerge in LMs up to 1B parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Attention-Sink.</description>

      <title>Mix Data or Merge Models? Optimizing for Diverse Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been adopted and deployed worldwide for a broad variety of applications. However, ensuring their safe use remains a significant challenge. Preference training and safety measures often overfit to harms prevalent in Western-centric datasets, and safety protocols frequently fail to extend to multilingual settings. In this work, we explore model merging in a diverse multi-task setting, combining safety and general-purpose tasks within a multilingual context. Each language introduces unique and varied learning challenges across tasks. We find that objective-based merging is more effective than mixing data, with improvements of up to 8% and 10% in general performance and safety respectively. We also find that language-based merging is highly effective -- by merging monolingually fine-tuned models, we achieve a 4% increase in general performance and 7% reduction in harm across all languages on top of the data mixtures method using the same available data. Overall, our comprehensive study of merging approaches provides a useful framework for building strong and safe multilingual models.</description>

      <title>Local and Global Decoding in Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text generation, a key component in applications such as dialogue systems, relies on decoding algorithms that sample strings from a language model distribution. Traditional methods, such as top-$k$ and top-$\pi$, apply local normalisation to the model's output distribution, which can distort it. In this paper, we investigate the effect of this distortion by introducing globally-normalised versions of these decoding methods. Additionally, we propose an independent Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to approximate sampling from globally-normalised distributions without explicitly computing them. Our empirical analysis compares the performance of local and global normalisation across two decoding algorithms (top-$k$ and top-$\pi$) with various hyperparameters, using Pythia language models. Results show that, in most configurations, global decoding performs worse than the local decoding version of the same algorithms -- despite preserving the distribution's integrity. Our results suggest that distortion is an important feature of local decoding algorithms.</description>

      <title>LongMemEval: Benchmarking Chat Assistants on Long-Term Interactive Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM)-driven chat assistant systems have integrated memory components to track user-assistant chat histories, enabling more accurate and personalized responses. However, their long-term memory capabilities in sustained interactions remain underexplored. This paper introduces LongMemEval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate five core long-term memory abilities of chat assistants: information extraction, multi-session reasoning, temporal reasoning, knowledge updates, and abstention. With 500 meticulously curated questions embedded within freely scalable user-assistant chat histories, LongMemEval presents a significant challenge to existing long-term memory systems, with commercial chat assistants and long-context LLMs showing 30% accuracy drop on memorizing information across sustained interactions. We then present a unified framework that breaks down the long-term memory design into four design choices across the indexing, retrieval, and reading stages. Built upon key experimental insights, we propose several memory designs including session decomposition for optimizing value granularity, fact-augmented key expansion for enhancing the index structure, and time-aware query expansion for refining the search scope. Experiment results show that these optimizations greatly improve both memory recall and downstream question answering on LongMemEval. Overall, our study provides valuable resources and guidance for advancing the long-term memory capabilities of LLM-based chat assistants, paving the way toward more personalized and reliable conversational AI.</description>

      <title>Your Mixture-of-Experts LLM Is Secretly an Embedding Model For Free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel on generation tasks, their decoder-only architecture often limits their potential as embedding models if no further representation finetuning is applied. Does this contradict their claim of generalists? To answer the question, we take a closer look at Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs. Our study shows that the expert routers in MoE LLMs can serve as an off-the-shelf embedding model with promising performance on a diverse class of embedding-focused tasks, without requiring any finetuning. Moreover, our extensive analysis shows that the MoE routing weights (RW) is complementary to the hidden state (HS) of LLMs, a widely-used embedding. Compared to HS, we find that RW is more robust to the choice of prompts and focuses on high-level semantics. Motivated by the analysis, we propose MoEE combining RW and HS, which achieves better performance than using either separately. Our exploration of their combination and prompting strategy shed several novel insights, e.g., a weighted sum of RW and HS similarities outperforms the similarity on their concatenation. Our experiments are conducted on 6 embedding tasks with 20 datasets from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). The results demonstrate the significant improvement brought by MoEE to LLM-based embedding without further finetuning.</description>

      <title>DuoAttention: Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference with Retrieval and Streaming Heads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying long-context large language models (LLMs) is essential but poses significant computational and memory challenges. Caching all Key and Value (KV) states across all attention heads consumes substantial memory. Existing KV cache pruning methods either damage the long-context capabilities of LLMs or offer only limited efficiency improvements. In this paper, we identify that only a fraction of attention heads, a.k.a, Retrieval Heads, are critical for processing long contexts and require full attention across all tokens. In contrast, all other heads, which primarily focus on recent tokens and attention sinks--referred to as Streaming Heads--do not require full attention. Based on this insight, we introduce DuoAttention, a framework that only applies a full KV cache to retrieval heads while using a light-weight, constant-length KV cache for streaming heads, which reduces both LLM's decoding and pre-filling memory and latency without compromising its long-context abilities. DuoAttention uses a lightweight, optimization-based algorithm with synthetic data to identify retrieval heads accurately. Our method significantly reduces long-context inference memory by up to 2.55x for MHA and 1.67x for GQA models while speeding up decoding by up to 2.18x and 1.50x and accelerating pre-filling by up to 1.73x and 1.63x for MHA and GQA models, respectively, with minimal accuracy loss compared to full attention. Notably, combined with quantization, DuoAttention enables Llama-3-8B decoding with 3.3 million context length on a single A100 GPU.

      <title>Leveraging Social Determinants of Health in Alzheimer's Research Using LLM-Augmented Literature Mining and Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that social determinants of health (SDoH), a set of nonmedical factors, affect individuals' risks of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. Nevertheless, the etiological mechanisms underlying such relationships remain largely unclear, mainly due to difficulties in collecting relevant information. This study presents a novel, automated framework that leverages recent advancements of large language model (LLM) and natural language processing techniques to mine SDoH knowledge from extensive literature and integrate it with AD-related biological entities extracted from the general-purpose knowledge graph PrimeKG. Utilizing graph neural networks, we performed link prediction tasks to evaluate the resultant SDoH-augmented knowledge graph. Our framework shows promise for enhancing knowledge discovery in AD and can be generalized to other SDoH-related research areas, offering a new tool for exploring the impact of social determinants on health outcomes.

      <title>Alignment Between the Decision-Making Logic of LLMs and Human Cognition: A Case Study on Legal LLMs</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a method to evaluate the alignment between the decision-making logic of Large Language Models (LLMs) and human cognition in a case study on legal LLMs. Unlike traditional evaluations on language generation results, we propose to evaluate the correctness of the detailed decision-making logic of an LLM behind its seemingly correct outputs, which represents the core challenge for an LLM to earn human trust. To this end, we quantify the interactions encoded by the LLM as primitive decision-making logic, because recent theoretical achievements have proven several mathematical guarantees of the faithfulness of the interaction-based explanation. We design a set of metrics to evaluate the detailed decision-making logic of LLMs. Experiments show that even when the language generation results appear correct, a significant portion of the internal inference logic contains notable issues.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of the term "mechanistic interpretability" has accompanied increasing interest in understanding neural models -- particularly language models. However, this jargon has also led to a fair amount of confusion. So, what does it mean to be "mechanistic"? We describe four uses of the term in interpretability research. The most narrow technical definition requires a claim of causality, while a broader technical definition allows for any exploration of a model's internals. However, the term also has a narrow cultural definition describing a cultural movement. To understand this semantic drift, we present a history of the NLP interpretability community and the formation of the separate, parallel "mechanistic" interpretability community. Finally, we discuss the broad cultural definition -- encompassing the entire field of interpretability -- and why the traditional NLP interpretability community has come to embrace it. We argue that the polysemy of "mechanistic" is the product of a critical divide within the interpretability community.</description>

      <title>HLM-Cite: Hybrid Language Model Workflow for Text-based Scientific Citation Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Citation networks are critical in modern science, and predicting which previous papers (candidates) will a new paper (query) cite is a critical problem. However, the roles of a paper's citations vary significantly, ranging from foundational knowledge basis to superficial contexts. Distinguishing these roles requires a deeper understanding of the logical relationships among papers, beyond simple edges in citation networks. The emergence of LLMs with textual reasoning capabilities offers new possibilities for discerning these relationships, but there are two major challenges. First, in practice, a new paper may select its citations from gigantic existing papers, where the texts exceed the context length of LLMs. Second, logical relationships between papers are implicit, and directly prompting an LLM to predict citations may result in surface-level textual similarities rather than the deeper logical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce the novel concept of core citation, which identifies the critical references that go beyond superficial mentions. Thereby, we elevate the citation prediction task from a simple binary classification to distinguishing core citations from both superficial citations and non-citations. To address this, we propose $\textbf{HLM-Cite}$, a $\textbf{H}$ybrid $\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{M}$odel workflow for citation prediction, which combines embedding and generative LMs. We design a curriculum finetune procedure to adapt a pretrained text embedding model to coarsely retrieve high-likelihood core citations from vast candidates and then design an LLM agentic workflow to rank the retrieved papers through one-shot reasoning, revealing the implicit relationships among papers. With the pipeline, we can scale the candidate sets to 100K papers. We evaluate HLM-Cite across 19 scientific fields, demonstrating a 17.6% performance improvement comparing SOTA methods.</description>

      <title>Can a large language model be a gaslighter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained human trust due to their capabilities and helpfulness. However, this in turn may allow LLMs to affect users' mindsets by manipulating language. It is termed as gaslighting, a psychological effect. In this work, we aim to investigate the vulnerability of LLMs under prompt-based and fine-tuning-based gaslighting attacks. Therefore, we propose a two-stage framework DeepCoG designed to: 1) elicit gaslighting plans from LLMs with the proposed DeepGaslighting prompting template, and 2) acquire gaslighting conversations from LLMs through our Chain-of-Gaslighting method. The gaslighting conversation dataset along with a corresponding safe dataset is applied to fine-tuning-based attacks on open-source LLMs and anti-gaslighting safety alignment on these LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that both prompt-based and fine-tuning-based attacks transform three open-source LLMs into gaslighters. In contrast, we advanced three safety alignment strategies to strengthen (by 12.05%) the safety guardrail of LLMs. Our safety alignment strategies have minimal impacts on the utility of LLMs. Empirical studies indicate that an LLM may be a potential gaslighter, even if it passed the harmfulness test on general dangerous queries.</description>

      <title>Encoding Agent Trajectories as Representations with Sequence Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal data faces many analogous challenges to natural language text including the ordering of locations (words) in a sequence, long range dependencies between locations, and locations having multiple meanings. In this work, we propose a novel model for representing high dimensional spatiotemporal trajectories as sequences of discrete locations and encoding them with a Transformer-based neural network architecture. Similar to language models, our Sequence Transformer for Agent Representation Encodings (STARE) model can learn representations and structure in trajectory data through both supervisory tasks (e.g., classification), and self-supervisory tasks (e.g., masked modelling). We present experimental results on various synthetic and real trajectory datasets and show that our proposed model can learn meaningful encodings that are useful for many downstream tasks including discriminating between labels and indicating similarity between locations. Using these encodings, we also learn relationships between agents and locations present in spatiotemporal data.</description>

      <title>P-FOLIO: Evaluating and Improving Logical Reasoning with Abundant Human-Written Reasoning Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing methods on understanding the capabilities of LLMs in logical reasoning rely on binary entailment classification or synthetically derived rationales, which are not sufficient for proper investigation of model's capabilities. We present P-FOLIO, a human-annotated dataset consisting of diverse and complex reasoning chains for a set of realistic logical reasoning stories also written by humans. P-FOLIO is collected with an annotation protocol that facilitates humans to annotate well-structured natural language proofs for first-order logic reasoning problems in a step-by-step manner. The number of reasoning steps in P-FOLIO span from 0 to 20. We further use P-FOLIO to evaluate and improve large-language-model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. We evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities at a fine granularity via single-step inference rule classification, with more diverse inference rules of more diverse and higher levels of complexities than previous works. Given that a single model-generated reasoning chain could take a completely different path than the human-annotated one, we sample multiple reasoning chains from a model and use pass@k metrics for evaluating the quality of model-generated reasoning chains. We show that human-written reasoning chains significantly boost the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs via many-shot prompting and fine-tuning. Furthermore, fine-tuning Llama3-7B on P-FOLIO improves the model performance by 10% or more on three other out-of-domain logical reasoning datasets. We also conduct detailed analysis to show where most powerful LLMs fall short in reasoning. We will release the dataset and code publicly.</description>

      <title>nach0-pc: Multi-task Language Model with Molecular Point Cloud Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements have integrated Language Models (LMs) into a drug discovery pipeline. However, existing models mostly work with SMILES and SELFIES chemical string representations, which lack spatial features vital for drug discovery. Additionally, attempts to translate chemical 3D structures into text format encounter issues such as excessive length and insufficient atom connectivity information. To address these issues, we introduce nach0-pc, a model combining domain-specific encoder and textual representation to handle spatial arrangement of atoms effectively. Our approach utilizes a molecular point cloud encoder for concise and order-invariant structure representation. We introduce a novel pre-training scheme for molecular point clouds to distillate the knowledge from spatial molecular structures datasets. After fine-tuning within both single-task and multi-task frameworks, nach0-pc demonstrates performance comparable with other diffusion models in terms of generated samples quality across several established spatial molecular generation tasks. Notably, our model is a multi-task approach, in contrast to diffusion models being limited to single tasks. Additionally, it is capable of processing point cloud-related data, which language models are not capable of handling due to memory limitations. These lead to our model having reduced training and inference time while maintaining on par performance.</description>

      <title>Natural Language Counterfactual Explanations for Graphs Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a critical area of research to unravel the opaque inner logic of (deep) machine learning models. Among the various XAI techniques proposed in the literature, counterfactual explanations stand out as one of the most promising approaches. However, these ``what-if'' explanations are frequently complex and technical, making them difficult for non-experts to understand and, more broadly, challenging for humans to interpret. To bridge this gap, in this work, we exploit the power of open-source Large Language Models to generate natural language explanations when prompted with valid counterfactual instances produced by state-of-the-art explainers for graph-based models. Experiments across several graph datasets and counterfactual explainers show that our approach effectively produces accurate natural language representations of counterfactual instances, as demonstrated by key performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multi-Step Reasoning Abilities of Language Models through Direct Q-Function Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a crucial role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences and improving their ability to perform complex tasks. However, current approaches either require significant computational resources due to the use of multiple models and extensive online sampling for training (e.g., PPO) or are framed as bandit problems (e.g., DPO, DRO), which often struggle with multi-step reasoning tasks, such as math problem-solving and complex reasoning that involve long chains of thought. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Direct Q-function Optimization (DQO), which formulates the response generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilizes the soft actor-critic (SAC) framework to optimize a Q-function directly parameterized by the language model. The MDP formulation of DQO offers structural advantages over bandit-based methods, enabling more effective process supervision. Experimental results on two math problem-solving datasets, GSM8K and MATH, demonstrate that DQO outperforms previous methods, establishing it as a promising offline reinforcement learning approach for aligning language models.</description>

      <title>DARE the Extreme: Revisiting Delta-Parameter Pruning For Fine-Tuned Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Storing open-source fine-tuned models separately introduces redundancy and increases response times in applications utilizing multiple models. Delta-parameter pruning (DPP), particularly the random drop and rescale (DARE) method proposed by Yu et al., addresses this by pruning the majority of delta parameters--the differences between fine-tuned and pre-trained model weights--while typically maintaining minimal performance loss. However, DARE fails when either the pruning rate or the magnitude of the delta parameters is large. We highlight two key reasons for this failure: (1) an excessively large rescaling factor as pruning rates increase, and (2) high mean and variance in the delta parameters. To push DARE's limits, we introduce DAREx (DARE the eXtreme), which features two algorithmic improvements: (1) DAREx-q, a rescaling factor modification that significantly boosts performance at high pruning rates (e.g., &gt;30 % on COLA and SST2 for encoder models, with even greater gains in decoder models), and (2) DAREx-L2, which combines DARE with AdamR, an in-training method that applies appropriate delta regularization before DPP. We also demonstrate that DAREx-q can be seamlessly combined with vanilla parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA and can facilitate structural DPP. Additionally, we revisit the application of importance-based pruning techniques within DPP, demonstrating that they outperform random-based methods when delta parameters are large. Through this comprehensive study, we develop a pipeline for selecting the most appropriate DPP method under various practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Inference and Verbalization Functions During In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LMs) are capable of in-context learning from a few demonstrations (example-label pairs) to solve new tasks during inference. Despite the intuitive importance of high-quality demonstrations, previous work has observed that, in some settings, ICL performance is minimally affected by irrelevant labels (Min et al., 2022). We hypothesize that LMs perform ICL with irrelevant labels via two sequential processes: an inference function that solves the task, followed by a verbalization function that maps the inferred answer to the label space. Importantly, we hypothesize that the inference function is invariant to remappings of the label space (e.g., "true"/"false" to "cat"/"dog"), enabling LMs to share the same inference function across settings with different label words. We empirically validate this hypothesis with controlled layer-wise interchange intervention experiments. Our findings confirm the hypotheses on multiple datasets and tasks (natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and topic classification) and further suggest that the two functions can be localized in specific layers across various open-sourced models, including GEMMA-7B, MISTRAL-7B-V0.3, GEMMA-2-27B, and LLAMA-3.1-70B.</description>

      <title>LogLM: From Task-based to Instruction-based Automated Log Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic log analysis is essential for the efficient Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) of software systems, providing critical insights into system behaviors. However, existing approaches mostly treat log analysis as training a model to perform an isolated task, using task-specific log-label pairs. These task-based approaches are inflexible in generalizing to complex scenarios, depend on task-specific training data, and cost significantly when deploying multiple models. In this paper, we propose an instruction-based training approach that transforms log-label pairs from multiple tasks and domains into a unified format of instruction-response pairs. Our trained model, LogLM, can follow complex user instructions and generalize better across different tasks, thereby increasing flexibility and reducing the dependence on task-specific training data. By integrating major log analysis tasks into a single model, our approach also relieves model deployment burden. Experimentally, LogLM outperforms existing approaches across five log analysis capabilities, and exhibits strong generalization abilities on complex instructions and unseen tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of scientific progress requires innovative tools that can accelerate discovery. While recent AI methods, particularly large language models (LLMs), have shown promise in tasks such as hypothesis generation and experimental design, they fall short in replicating the collaborative nature of real-world scientific practices, where diverse teams of experts work together to tackle complex problems. To address the limitation, we propose an LLM-based multi-agent system, i.e., Virtual Scientists (VirSci), designed to mimic the teamwork inherent in scientific research. VirSci organizes a team of agents to collaboratively generate, evaluate, and refine research ideas. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that this multi-agent approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method in producing novel and impactful scientific ideas, showing potential in aligning with key insights in the Science of Science field. Our findings suggest that integrating collaborative agents can lead to more innovative scientific outputs, offering a robust system for autonomous scientific discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large vision-language models (LVLMs) evolve rapidly, the demand for high-quality and diverse data to align these models becomes increasingly crucial. However, the creation of such data with human supervision proves costly and time-intensive. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of AI feedback to scale supervision for aligning LVLMs. We introduce VLFeedback, the first large-scale vision-language feedback dataset, comprising over 82K multi-modal instructions and comprehensive rationales generated by off-the-shelf models without human annotations. To evaluate the effectiveness of AI feedback for vision-language alignment, we train Silkie, an LVLM fine-tuned via direct preference optimization on VLFeedback. Silkie showcases exceptional performance regarding helpfulness, visual faithfulness, and safety metrics. It outperforms its base model by 6.9\% and 9.5\% in perception and cognition tasks, reduces hallucination issues on MMHal-Bench, and exhibits enhanced resilience against red-teaming attacks. Furthermore, our analysis underscores the advantage of AI feedback, particularly in fostering preference diversity to deliver more comprehensive improvements. Our dataset, training code and models are available at https://vlf-silkie.github.io.</description>

      <title>Exact Aggregation for Federated and Efficient Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a popular technique for efficient fine-tuning of foundation models. However, applying LoRA in federated learning environments, where data is distributed across multiple clients, presents unique challenges. Existing methods rely on traditional federated averaging of LoRA adapters, resulting in inexact updates. To address this, we propose Federated Exact LoRA, or FedEx-LoRA, which adds a residual error term to the pretrained frozen weight matrix. Our approach achieves exact updates with minimal computational and communication overhead, preserving LoRA's efficiency. We evaluate the method on various Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, showing consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art methods across multiple settings. Through extensive analysis, we quantify that the deviations in updates from the ideal solution are significant, highlighting the need for exact aggregation. Our method's simplicity, efficiency, and broad applicability position it as a promising solution for accurate and effective federated fine-tuning of foundation models.</description>

      <title>MTL-LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation for Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has been widely employed for domain adaptation, with LoRA being one of the most prominent methods due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, in multi-task learning (MTL) scenarios, LoRA tends to obscure the distinction between tasks by projecting sparse high-dimensional features from different tasks into the same dense low-dimensional intrinsic space. This leads to task interference and suboptimal performance for LoRA and its variants. To tackle this challenge, we propose MTL-LoRA, which retains the advantages of low-rank adaptation while significantly enhancing multi-task learning capabilities. MTL-LoRA augments LoRA by incorporating additional task-adaptive parameters that differentiate task-specific information and effectively capture shared knowledge across various tasks within low-dimensional spaces. This approach enables large language models (LLMs) pre-trained on general corpus to adapt to different target task domains with a limited number of trainable parameters. Comprehensive experimental results, including evaluations on public academic benchmarks for natural language understanding, commonsense reasoning, and image-text understanding, as well as real-world industrial text Ads relevance datasets, demonstrate that MTL-LoRA outperforms LoRA and its various variants with comparable or even fewer learnable parameters in multitask learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the creation, evolution, and dissemination of scientific knowledge is crucial for bridging diverse subject areas and addressing complex global challenges such as pandemics, climate change, and ethical AI. Scientometrics, the quantitative and qualitative study of scientific literature, provides valuable insights into these processes. We introduce Scito2M, a longitudinal scientometric dataset with over two million academic publications, providing comprehensive contents information and citation graphs to support cross-disciplinary analyses. Using Scito2M, we conduct a temporal study spanning over 30 years to explore key questions in scientometrics: the evolution of academic terminology, citation patterns, and interdisciplinary knowledge exchange. Our findings reveal critical insights, such as disparities in epistemic cultures, knowledge production modes, and citation practices. For example, rapidly developing, application-driven fields like LLMs exhibit significantly shorter citation age (2.48 years) compared to traditional theoretical disciplines like oral history (9.71 years).</description>

      <title>Reconstructive Visual Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces reconstructive visual instruction tuning (ROSS), a family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that exploit vision-centric supervision signals. In contrast to conventional visual instruction tuning approaches that exclusively supervise text outputs, ROSS prompts LMMs to supervise visual outputs via reconstructing input images. By doing so, it capitalizes on the inherent richness and detail present within input images themselves, which are often lost in pure text supervision. However, producing meaningful feedback from natural images is challenging due to the heavy spatial redundancy of visual signals. To address this issue, ROSS employs a denoising objective to reconstruct latent representations of input images, avoiding directly regressing exact raw RGB values. This intrinsic activation design inherently encourages LMMs to maintain image detail, thereby enhancing their fine-grained comprehension capabilities and reducing hallucinations. Empirically, ROSS consistently brings significant improvements across different visual encoders and language models. In comparison with extrinsic assistance state-of-the-art alternatives that aggregate multiple visual experts, ROSS delivers competitive performance with a single SigLIP visual encoder, demonstrating the efficacy of our vision-centric supervision tailored for visual outputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the alignment of \emph{Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition} (CVPR) research with the principles of the "bitter lesson" proposed by Rich Sutton. We analyze two decades of CVPR abstracts and titles using large language models (LLMs) to assess the field's embracement of these principles. Our methodology leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques to systematically evaluate the evolution of research approaches in computer vision. The results reveal significant trends in the adoption of general-purpose learning algorithms and the utilization of increased computational resources. We discuss the implications of these findings for the future direction of computer vision research and its potential impact on broader artificial intelligence development. This work contributes to the ongoing dialogue about the most effective strategies for advancing machine learning and computer vision, offering insights that may guide future research priorities and methodologies in the field.</description>

      <title>Survival of the Safest: Towards Secure Prompt Optimization through Interleaved Multi-Objective Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities; however, the optimization of their prompts has historically prioritized performance metrics at the expense of crucial safety and security considerations. To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce "Survival of the Safest" (SoS), an innovative multi-objective prompt optimization framework that enhances both performance and security in LLMs simultaneously. SoS utilizes an interleaved multi-objective evolution strategy, integrating semantic, feedback, and crossover mutations to effectively traverse the prompt landscape. Differing from the computationally demanding Pareto front methods, SoS provides a scalable solution that expedites optimization in complex, high-dimensional discrete search spaces while keeping computational demands low. Our approach accommodates flexible weighting of objectives and generates a pool of optimized candidates, empowering users to select prompts that optimally meet their specific performance and security needs. Experimental evaluations across diverse benchmark datasets affirm SoS's efficacy in delivering high performance and notably enhancing safety and security compared to single-objective methods. This advancement marks a significant stride towards the deployment of LLM systems that are both high-performing and secure across varied industrial applications</description>

      <title>OpenR: An Open Source Framework for Advanced Reasoning with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this technical report, we introduce OpenR, an open-source framework designed to integrate key components for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). OpenR unifies data acquisition, reinforcement learning training (both online and offline), and non-autoregressive decoding into a cohesive software platform. Our goal is to establish an open-source platform and community to accelerate the development of LLM reasoning. Inspired by the success of OpenAI's o1 model, which demonstrated improved reasoning abilities through step-by-step reasoning and reinforcement learning, OpenR integrates test-time compute, reinforcement learning, and process supervision to improve reasoning in LLMs. Our work is the first to provide an open-source framework that explores the core techniques of OpenAI's o1 model with reinforcement learning, achieving advanced reasoning capabilities beyond traditional autoregressive methods. We demonstrate the efficacy of OpenR by evaluating it on the MATH dataset, utilising publicly available data and search methods. Our initial experiments confirm substantial gains, with relative improvements in reasoning and performance driven by test-time computation and reinforcement learning through process reward models. The OpenR framework, including code, models, and datasets, is accessible at https://openreasoner.github.io.</description>

      <title>BiDoRA: Bi-level Optimization-Based Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large language models (LLMs) has gained considerable attention as a flexible and efficient way of adapting LLMs to downstream tasks. Among these methods, weighted decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) has emerged as a promising approach. DoRA bridges the gap between low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and full fine-tuning (FT) by decomposing the weight matrices into magnitude and direction components, thereby maintaining learning behavior similar to FT. Although DoRA shows encouraging performance, it introduces additional parameters compared to LoRA, which potentially increases the risk of overfitting. Moreover, optimizing magnitude and direction simultaneously leads to a coupled gradient updating pattern for both components, limiting its learning capacity. To overcome these limitations, we propose BiDoRA, a bi-level optimization-based PEFT method. In BiDoRA, the direction and magnitude components are optimized on two distinct datasets at different optimization levels, mitigating the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the asynchronous optimization of the two components promotes their decoupling, allowing for more flexible gradient updates suitable for various downstream tasks. Evaluation of BiDoRA on fourteen datasets spanning natural language understanding, natural language generation, and token classification reveals that it significantly outperforms DoRA and other PEFT methods. The superior performance of BiDoRA underscores its effectiveness. The code for BiDoRA is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BiDoRA-5D31.</description>

      <title>ECIS-VQG: Generation of Entity-centric Information-seeking Questions from Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies on question generation from videos have mostly focused on generating questions about common objects and attributes and hence are not entity-centric. In this work, we focus on the generation of entity-centric information-seeking questions from videos. Such a system could be useful for video-based learning, recommending ``People Also Ask'' questions, video-based chatbots, and fact-checking. Our work addresses three key challenges: identifying question-worthy information, linking it to entities, and effectively utilizing multimodal signals. Further, to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist a large-scale dataset for this task. Most video question generation datasets are on TV shows, movies, or human activities or lack entity-centric information-seeking questions. Hence, we contribute a diverse dataset of YouTube videos, VideoQuestions, consisting of 411 videos with 2265 manually annotated questions. We further propose a model architecture combining Transformers, rich context signals (titles, transcripts, captions, embeddings), and a combination of cross-entropy and contrastive loss function to encourage entity-centric question generation. Our best method yields BLEU, ROUGE, CIDEr, and METEOR scores of 71.3, 78.6, 7.31, and 81.9, respectively, demonstrating practical usability. We make the code and dataset publicly available. https://github.com/thePhukan/ECIS-VQG</description>

      <title>Self-Data Distillation for Recovering Quality in Pruned Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have driven significant progress in natural language processing, but their deployment requires substantial compute and memory resources. As models scale, compression techniques become essential for balancing model quality with computational efficiency. Structured pruning, which removes less critical components of the model, is a promising strategy for reducing complexity. However, one-shot pruning often results in significant quality degradation, particularly in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. To recover lost quality, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly applied, but it can lead to catastrophic forgetting by shifting the model's learned data distribution. Therefore, addressing the degradation from both pruning and SFT is essential to preserve the original model's quality. In this work, we propose self-data distilled fine-tuning to address these challenges. Our approach leverages the original, unpruned model to generate a distilled dataset that preserves semantic richness and mitigates catastrophic forgetting by maintaining alignment with the base model's knowledge. Empirically, we demonstrate that self-data distillation consistently outperforms standard SFT, improving average accuracy by up to 8% on the HuggingFace OpenLLM Leaderboard v1. Specifically, when pruning 6 decoder blocks on Llama3.1-8B Instruct (i.e., 32 to 24 layers, reducing the model size from 8.03B to 6.72B parameters), our method retains 91.2% of the original model's accuracy compared to 81.7% with SFT, while reducing real-world FLOPs by 16.30%. Furthermore, our approach scales effectively across datasets, with the quality improving as the dataset size increases.</description>

      <title>Collu-Bench: A Benchmark for Predicting Language Model Hallucinations in Code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their success, large language models (LLMs) face the critical challenge of hallucinations, generating plausible but incorrect content. While much research has focused on hallucinations in multiple modalities including images and natural language text, less attention has been given to hallucinations in source code, which leads to incorrect and vulnerable code that causes significant financial loss. To pave the way for research in LLMs' hallucinations in code, we introduce Collu-Bench, a benchmark for predicting code hallucinations of LLMs across code generation (CG) and automated program repair (APR) tasks. Collu-Bench includes 13,234 code hallucination instances collected from five datasets and 11 diverse LLMs, ranging from open-source models to commercial ones. To better understand and predict code hallucinations, Collu-Bench provides detailed features such as the per-step log probabilities of LLMs' output, token types, and the execution feedback of LLMs' generated code for in-depth analysis. In addition, we conduct experiments to predict hallucination on Collu-Bench, using both traditional machine learning techniques and neural networks, which achieves 22.03 -- 33.15% accuracy. Our experiments draw insightful findings of code hallucination patterns, reveal the challenge of accurately localizing LLMs' hallucinations, and highlight the need for more sophisticated techniques.</description>

      <title>Divide, Reweight, and Conquer: A Logit Arithmetic Approach for In-Context Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) emerges as a key feature for Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing them to adapt to new tasks by leveraging task-specific examples without updating model parameters. However, ICL faces challenges with increasing numbers of examples due to performance degradation and quadratic computational costs. In this paper, we propose Logit Arithmetic Reweighting Approach (LARA), a novel framework that enhances ICL by using logit-based ensembling of multiple demonstrations. Our approach divides long input demonstrations into parallelizable shorter inputs to significantly reduce memory requirements, and then effectively aggregate the information by reweighting logits of each group via a non-gradient optimization approach. We further introduce Binary LARA (B-LARA), a variant that constrains weights to binary values to simplify the search space and reduces memory usage by filtering out less informative demonstration groups. Experiments on BBH and MMLU demonstrate that LARA and B-LARA outperform all baseline methods in both accuracy and memory efficiency. We also conduct extensive analysis to show that LARA generalizes well to scenarios of varying numbers of examples from limited to many-shot demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Learning Linear Attention in Polynomial Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous research has explored the computational expressivity of Transformer models in simulating Boolean circuits or Turing machines. However, the learnability of these simulators from observational data has remained an open question. Our study addresses this gap by providing the first polynomial-time learnability results (specifically strong, agnostic PAC learning) for single-layer Transformers with linear attention. We show that linear attention may be viewed as a linear predictor in a suitably defined RKHS. As a consequence, the problem of learning any linear transformer may be converted into the problem of learning an ordinary linear predictor in an expanded feature space, and any such predictor may be converted back into a multiheaded linear transformer. Moving to generalization, we show how to efficiently identify training datasets for which every empirical risk minimizer is equivalent (up to trivial symmetries) to the linear Transformer that generated the data, thereby guaranteeing the learned model will correctly generalize across all inputs. Finally, we provide examples of computations expressible via linear attention and therefore polynomial-time learnable, including associative memories, finite automata, and a class of Universal Turing Machine (UTMs) with polynomially bounded computation histories. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on three tasks: learning random linear attention networks, key--value associations, and learning to execute finite automata. Our findings bridge a critical gap between theoretical expressivity and learnability of Transformers, and show that flexible and general models of computation are efficiently learnable.</description>

      <title>Can We Predict Performance of Large Models across Vision-Language Tasks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating large vision-language models (LVLMs) is very expensive, due to the high computational costs and the wide variety of tasks. The good news is that if we already have some observed performance scores, we may be able to infer unknown ones. In this study, we propose a new framework for predicting unknown performance scores based on observed ones from other LVLMs or tasks. We first formulate the performance prediction as a matrix completion task. Specifically, we construct a sparse performance matrix $\boldsymbol{R}$, where each entry $R_{mn}$ represents the performance score of the $m$-th model on the $n$-th dataset. By applying probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), we can complete the performance matrix, that is, predict unknown scores. Additionally, we estimate the uncertainty of performance prediction based on MCMC. Practitioners can evaluate their models on untested tasks with higher uncertainty first, quickly reducing errors in performance prediction. We further introduce several improvements to enhance PMF for scenarios with sparse observed performance scores. In experiments, we systematically evaluate 108 LVLMs on 176 datasets from 36 benchmarks, constructing training and testing sets for validating our framework. Our experiments demonstrate the accuracy of PMF in predicting unknown scores, the reliability of uncertainty estimates in ordering evaluations, and the effectiveness of our enhancements for handling sparse data.</description>

Abstract: The existence of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) -- efficient quantum circuits that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries -- has been a central open question, with significant implications for cryptography, complexity theory, and fundamental physics. In this work, we close this question by proving that PRUs exist, assuming that any quantum-secure one-way function exists. We establish this result for both (1) the standard notion of PRUs, which are secure against any efficient adversary that makes queries to the unitary $U$, and (2) a stronger notion of PRUs, which are secure even against adversaries that can query both the unitary $U$ and its inverse $U^\dagger$. In the process, we prove that any algorithm that makes queries to a Haar-random unitary can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer, up to inverse-exponential trace distance.</description>

Abstract: Interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation, enabling models to produce and interpret both images and text in arbitrary sequences, have become a pivotal area in multimodal learning. Despite significant advancements, the evaluation of this capability remains insufficient. Existing benchmarks suffer from limitations in data scale, scope, and evaluation depth, while current evaluation metrics are often costly or biased, lacking in reliability for practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce MMIE, a large-scale knowledge-intensive benchmark for evaluating interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). MMIE comprises 20K meticulously curated multimodal queries, spanning 3 categories, 12 fields, and 102 subfields, including mathematics, coding, physics, literature, health, and arts. It supports both interleaved inputs and outputs, offering a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended question formats to evaluate diverse competencies. Moreover, we propose a reliable automated evaluation metric, leveraging a scoring model fine-tuned with human-annotated data and systematic evaluation criteria, aimed at reducing bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and metrics in providing a comprehensive evaluation of interleaved LVLMs. Specifically, we evaluate eight LVLMs, revealing that even the best models show significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results. We believe MMIE will drive further advancements in the development of interleaved LVLMs. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://mmie-bench.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Unified Representation of Genomic and Biomedical Concepts through Multi-Task, Multi-Source Contrastive Learning</title>

Abstract: We introduce GENomic Encoding REpresentation with Language Model (GENEREL), a framework designed to bridge genetic and biomedical knowledge bases. What sets GENEREL apart is its ability to fine-tune language models to infuse biological knowledge behind clinical concepts such as diseases and medications. This fine-tuning enables the model to capture complex biomedical relationships more effectively, enriching the understanding of how genomic data connects to clinical outcomes. By constructing a unified embedding space for biomedical concepts and a wide range of common SNPs from sources such as patient-level data, biomedical knowledge graphs, and GWAS summaries, GENEREL aligns the embeddings of SNPs and clinical concepts through multi-task contrastive learning. This allows the model to adapt to diverse natural language representations of biomedical concepts while bypassing the limitations of traditional code mapping systems across different data sources. Our experiments demonstrate GENEREL's ability to effectively capture the nuanced relationships between SNPs and clinical concepts. GENEREL also emerges to discern the degree of relatedness, potentially allowing for a more refined identification of concepts. This pioneering approach in constructing a unified embedding system for both SNPs and biomedical concepts enhances the potential for data integration and discovery in biomedical research.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-DPO: Adaptive Reward Margin is What Direct Preference Optimization Needs</title>

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and intentions is crucial for their utility, honesty, and safety. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a popular approach to achieve this alignment, but it faces challenges in computational efficiency and training stability. Recent methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) have proposed offline alternatives to RLHF, simplifying the process by reparameterizing the reward function. However, DPO depends on a potentially suboptimal reference model, and SimPO's assumption of a fixed target reward margin may lead to suboptimal decisions in diverse data settings. In this work, we propose $\alpha$-DPO, an adaptive preference optimization algorithm designed to address these limitations by introducing a dynamic reward margin. Specifically, $\alpha$-DPO employs an adaptive preference distribution, balancing the policy model and the reference model to achieve personalized reward margins. We provide theoretical guarantees for $\alpha$-DPO, demonstrating its effectiveness as a surrogate optimization objective and its ability to balance alignment and diversity through KL divergence control. Empirical evaluations on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard show that $\alpha$-DPO consistently outperforms DPO and SimPO across various model settings, establishing it as a robust approach for fine-tuning LLMs. Our method achieves significant improvements in win rates, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for LLM alignment.

      <title>HSR-Enhanced Sparse Attention Acceleration</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, but their performance on long-context tasks is often limited by the computational complexity of attention mechanisms. This paper introduces a novel approach to accelerate attention computation in LLMs, particularly for long-context scenarios. We leverage the inherent sparsity within attention mechanisms, both in conventional Softmax attention and ReLU attention (with $\mathsf{ReLU}^\alpha$ activation, $\alpha \in \mathbb{N}_+$), to significantly reduce the running time complexity. Our method employs a Half-Space Reporting (HSR) data structure to rapidly identify non-zero or "massively activated" entries in the attention matrix. We present theoretical analyses for two key scenarios: attention generation and full attention computation with long input context. Our approach achieves a running time of $O(mn^{4/5})$ significantly faster than the naive approach $O(mn)$ for attention generation, where $n$ is the context length, $m$ is the query length, and $d$ is the hidden dimension. We can also reduce the running time of full attention computation from $O(mn)$ to $O(mn^{1 - 1 / \lfloor d/2\rfloor} + mn^{4/5})$. Importantly, our method introduces no error for ReLU attention and only provably negligible error for Softmax attention, where the latter is supported by our empirical validation. This work represents a significant step towards enabling efficient long-context processing in LLMs, potentially broadening their applicability across various domains.</description>

      <title>Is Parameter Collision Hindering Continual Learning in LLMs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially, making continual learning (CL) essential for their dynamic deployment. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, such as O-LoRA, typically focus on constructing orthogonality tasks to decouple parameter interdependence from various domains.In this paper, we reveal that building non-collision parameters is a more critical factor in addressing CL challenges. Our theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that non-collision parameters can provide better task orthogonality, which is a sufficient but unnecessary condition. Furthermore, knowledge from multiple domains will be preserved in non-collision parameter subspaces, making it more difficult to forget previously seen data. Leveraging this insight, we propose Non-collision Low-Rank Adaptation (N-LoRA), a simple yet effective approach leveraging low collision rates to enhance CL in LLMs. Experimental results on multiple CL benchmarks indicate that N-LoRA achieves superior performance (+2.9), higher task orthogonality (*4.1 times), and lower parameter collision (*58.1 times) than SOTA methods.</description>

      <title>FunnelRAG: A Coarse-to-Fine Progressive Retrieval Paradigm for RAG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prevails in Large Language Models. It mainly consists of retrieval and generation. The retrieval modules (a.k.a. retrievers) aim to find useful information used to facilitate generation modules (a.k.a. generators). As such, generators' performance largely depends on the effectiveness and efficiency of retrievers. However, the retrieval paradigm that we design and use remains flat, which treats the retrieval procedures as a one-off deal with constant granularity. Despite effectiveness, we argue that they suffer from two limitations: (1) flat retrieval exerts a significant burden on one retriever; (2) constant granularity limits the ceiling of retrieval performance. In this work, we propose a progressive retrieval paradigm with coarse-to-fine granularity for RAG, termed FunnelRAG, so as to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, FunnelRAG establishes a progressive retrieval pipeline by collaborating coarse-to-fine granularity, large-to-small quantity, and low-to-high capacity, which can relieve the burden on one retriever and also promote the ceiling of retrieval performance. Extensive experiments manifest that FunnelRAG achieves comparable retrieval performance while the time overhead is reduced by nearly 40 percent.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Instruction Synthesis: Effective Exploration of Evolutionary Space with Tree Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instruction tuning is a crucial technique for aligning language models with humans' actual goals in the real world. Extensive research has highlighted the quality of instruction data is essential for the success of this alignment. However, creating high-quality data manually is labor-intensive and time-consuming, which leads researchers to explore using LLMs to synthesize data. Recent studies have focused on using a stronger LLM to iteratively enhance existing instruction data, showing promising results. Nevertheless, previous work often lacks control over the evolution direction, resulting in high uncertainty in the data synthesis process and low-quality instructions. In this paper, we introduce a general and scalable framework, IDEA-MCTS (Instruction Data Enhancement using Monte Carlo Tree Search), a scalable framework for efficiently synthesizing instructions. With tree search and evaluation models, it can efficiently guide each instruction to evolve into a high-quality form, aiding in instruction fine-tuning. Experimental results show that IDEA-MCTS significantly enhances the seed instruction data, raising the average evaluation scores of quality, diversity, and complexity from 2.19 to 3.81. Furthermore, in open-domain benchmarks, experimental results show that IDEA-MCTS improves the accuracy of real-world instruction-following skills in LLMs by an average of 5\% in low-resource settings.</description>

      <title>On Calibration of LLM-based Guard Models for Reliable Content Moderation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) pose significant risks due to the potential for generating harmful content or users attempting to evade guardrails. Existing studies have developed LLM-based guard models designed to moderate the input and output of threat LLMs, ensuring adherence to safety policies by blocking content that violates these protocols upon deployment. However, limited attention has been given to the reliability and calibration of such guard models. In this work, we empirically conduct comprehensive investigations of confidence calibration for 9 existing LLM-based guard models on 12 benchmarks in both user input and model output classification. Our findings reveal that current LLM-based guard models tend to 1) produce overconfident predictions, 2) exhibit significant miscalibration when subjected to jailbreak attacks, and 3) demonstrate limited robustness to the outputs generated by different types of response models. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of post-hoc calibration methods to mitigate miscalibration. We demonstrate the efficacy of temperature scaling and, for the first time, highlight the benefits of contextual calibration for confidence calibration of guard models, particularly in the absence of validation sets. Our analysis and experiments underscore the limitations of current LLM-based guard models and provide valuable insights for the future development of well-calibrated guard models toward more reliable content moderation. We also advocate for incorporating reliability evaluation of confidence calibration when releasing future LLM-based guard models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ever increasing sizes of Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond hundreds of billions of parameters have generated enormous pressure on the manufacturers of dedicated hardware accelerators and made the innovative design of the latter one of the most rapidly expanding fields of the AI industry. Various approaches have been explored to enable efficient and accurate processing of LLMs on the available accelerators given their computational and storage limitations. Among these, various quantization techniques have become the main focus of the community as a means of reducing the compute, communication and storage requirements. Quantization to lower precision formats naturally poses a number of challenges caused by the limited range of the available value representations. When it comes to processing the popular Transformer models on hardware, one of the main issues becomes calculation of the LayerNorm simply because accumulation of the variance requires a much wider dynamic range than the hardware enables. In this article, we address this matter and propose a computationally-efficient scaling technique that can be easily applied to Transformer models during inference. Our method suggests a straightforward way of scaling the LayerNorm inputs based on the static weights of the immediately preceding linear layers. The scaling factors are computed offline, based solely on the linear layer weights, hence no latency or computational overhead is added during inference. Most importantly, our technique ensures that no numerical issues such as overflow or underflow could happen during the compute. This approach offers smooth, accurate and resource-effective inference across a wide range of hardware architectures. The article provides theoretical justification as well as supporting numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>VisRAG: Vision-based Retrieval-augmented Generation on Multi-modality Documents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an effective technique that enables large language models (LLMs) to utilize external knowledge sources for generation. However, current RAG systems are solely based on text, rendering it impossible to utilize vision information like layout and images that play crucial roles in real-world multi-modality documents. In this paper, we introduce VisRAG, which tackles this issue by establishing a vision-language model (VLM)-based RAG pipeline. In this pipeline, instead of first parsing the document to obtain text, the document is directly embedded using a VLM as an image and then retrieved to enhance the generation of a VLM. Compared to traditional text-based RAG, VisRAG maximizes the retention and utilization of the data information in the original documents, eliminating the information loss introduced during the parsing process. We collect both open-source and synthetic data to train the retriever in VisRAG and explore a variety of generation methods. Experiments demonstrate that VisRAG outperforms traditional RAG in both the retrieval and generation stages, achieving a 25--39\% end-to-end performance gain over traditional text-based RAG pipeline. Further analysis reveals that VisRAG is effective in utilizing training data and demonstrates strong generalization capability, positioning it as a promising solution for RAG on multi-modality documents.

Abstract: The diffusion of financial news into market prices is a complex process, making it challenging to evaluate the connections between news events and market movements. This paper introduces FININ (Financial Interconnected News Influence Network), a novel market prediction model that captures not only the links between news and prices but also the interactions among news items themselves. FININ effectively integrates multi-modal information from both market data and news articles. We conduct extensive experiments on two datasets, encompassing the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ 100 indices over a 15-year period and over 2.7 million news articles. The results demonstrate FININ's effectiveness, outperforming advanced market prediction models with an improvement of 0.429 and 0.341 in the daily Sharpe ratio for the two markets respectively. Moreover, our results reveal insights into the financial news, including the delayed market pricing of news, the long memory effect of news, and the limitations of financial sentiment analysis in fully extracting predictive power from news data.</description>

      <title>Embedding Self-Correction as an Inherent Ability in Large Language Models for Enhanced Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate mathematical reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial in revolutionizing domains that heavily rely on such reasoning. However, LLMs often encounter difficulties in certain aspects of mathematical reasoning, leading to flawed reasoning and erroneous results. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel mechanism, the Chain of Self-Correction (CoSC), specifically designed to embed self-correction as an inherent ability in LLMs, enabling them to validate and rectify their own results. The CoSC mechanism operates through a sequence of self-correction stages. In each stage, the LLMs generate a program to address a given problem, execute this program using program-based tools to obtain an output, subsequently verify this output. Based on the verification, the LLMs either proceed to the next correction stage or finalize the answer. This iterative self-correction process allows the LLMs to refine their reasoning steps and improve the accuracy of their mathematical reasoning. To enable the CoSC mechanism at a low cost, we employ a two-phase finetuning approach. In the first phase, the LLMs are trained with a relatively small volume of seeding data generated from GPT-4, establishing an initial CoSC capability. In the second phase, the CoSC capability is further enhanced by training with a larger volume of self-generated data using the trained model in the first phase, without relying on the paid GPT-4. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CoSC significantly improves performance on traditional mathematical datasets among existing open-source LLMs. Notably, our CoSC-Code-34B model achieved a 53.5% score on MATH, the most challenging mathematical reasoning dataset in the public domain, surpassing the performance of well-established models such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, and even multi-modal LLMs like GPT-4V, Gemini-1.0 Pro, and Gemini-1.0 Ultra.</description>

      <title>Denial-of-Service Poisoning Attacks against Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that LLMs are vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, where adversarial inputs like spelling errors or non-semantic prompts trigger endless outputs without generating an [EOS] token. These attacks can potentially cause high latency and make LLM services inaccessible to other users or tasks. However, when there are speech-to-text interfaces (e.g., voice commands to a robot), executing such DoS attacks becomes challenging, as it is difficult to introduce spelling errors or non-semantic prompts through speech. A simple DoS attack in these scenarios would be to instruct the model to "Keep repeating Hello", but we observe that relying solely on natural instructions limits output length, which is bounded by the maximum length of the LLM's supervised finetuning (SFT) data. To overcome this limitation, we propose poisoning-based DoS (P-DoS) attacks for LLMs, demonstrating that injecting a single poisoned sample designed for DoS purposes can break the output length limit. For example, a poisoned sample can successfully attack GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini (via OpenAI's finetuning API) using less than $1, causing repeated outputs up to the maximum inference length (16K tokens, compared to 0.5K before poisoning). Additionally, we perform comprehensive ablation studies on open-source LLMs and extend our method to LLM agents, where attackers can control both the finetuning dataset and algorithm. Our findings underscore the urgent need for defenses against P-DoS attacks to secure LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/P-DoS.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in solving complex tasks across diverse domains, typically by employing agentic workflows that follow detailed instructions and operational sequences. However, constructing these workflows requires significant human effort, limiting scalability and generalizability. Recent research has sought to automate the generation and optimization of these workflows, but existing methods still rely on initial manual setup and fall short of achieving fully automated and effective workflow generation. To address this challenge, we reformulate workflow optimization as a search problem over code-represented workflows, where LLM-invoking nodes are connected by edges. We introduce AFlow, an automated framework that efficiently explores this space using Monte Carlo Tree Search, iteratively refining workflows through code modification, tree-structured experience, and execution feedback. Empirical evaluations across six benchmark datasets demonstrate AFlow's efficacy, yielding a 5.7% average improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, AFlow enables smaller models to outperform GPT-4o on specific tasks at 4.55% of its inference cost in dollars. The code will be available at https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT.</description>

      <title>TemporalBench: Benchmarking Fine-grained Temporal Understanding for Multimodal Video Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding fine-grained temporal dynamics is crucial for multimodal video comprehension and generation. Due to the lack of fine-grained temporal annotations, existing video benchmarks mostly resemble static image benchmarks and are incompetent at evaluating models for temporal understanding. In this paper, we introduce TemporalBench, a new benchmark dedicated to evaluating fine-grained temporal understanding in videos. TemporalBench consists of ~10K video question-answer pairs, derived from ~2K high-quality human annotations detailing the temporal dynamics in video clips. As a result, our benchmark provides a unique testbed for evaluating various temporal understanding and reasoning abilities such as action frequency, motion magnitude, event order, etc. Moreover, it enables evaluations on various tasks like both video question answering and captioning, both short and long video understanding, as well as different models such as multimodal video embedding models and text generation models. Results show that state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o achieve only 38.5% question answering accuracy on TemporalBench, demonstrating a significant gap (~30%) between humans and AI in temporal understanding. Furthermore, we notice a critical pitfall for multi-choice QA where LLMs can detect the subtle changes in negative captions and find a centralized description as a cue for its prediction, where we propose Multiple Binary Accuracy (MBA) to correct such bias. We hope that TemporalBench can foster research on improving models' temporal reasoning capabilities. Both dataset and evaluation code will be made available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on a variety of natural language understanding tasks. However, existing benchmarks are inadequate in measuring the complex logical reasoning capabilities of a model. We present FOLIO, a human-annotated, logically complex and diverse dataset for reasoning in natural language (NL), equipped with first-order logic (FOL) annotations. FOLIO consists of 1,430 examples (unique conclusions), each paired with one of 487 sets of premises used to deductively reason for the validity of each conclusion. The logical correctness of the premises and conclusions is ensured by their FOL annotations, which are automatically verified by an FOL inference engine. In addition to the main NL reasoning task, NL-FOL pairs in FOLIO constitute a new NL-FOL translation dataset. Our experiments on FOLIO systematically evaluate the FOL reasoning ability of supervised fine-tuning on medium-sized language models. For both NL reasoning and NL-FOL translation, we benchmark multiple state-of-the-art language models. Our results show that a subset of FOLIO presents a challenge for one of the most capable {Large Language Model (LLM)} publicly available, GPT-4.</description>

      <title>Improved Compositional Generalization by Generating Demonstrations for Meta-Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meta-learning and few-shot prompting are viable methods to induce certain types of compositional behaviour. However, these methods can be very sensitive to the choice of support examples used. Choosing good supports from the training data for a given test query is already a difficult problem, but in some cases solving this may not even be enough. We consider a grounded language learning problem (gSCAN) where good support examples for certain test splits might not even exist in the training data, or would be infeasible to search for. We design an agent which instead generates possible supports which are relevant to the test query and current state of the world, then uses these supports via meta-learning to solve the test query. We show substantially improved performance on a previously unsolved compositional behaviour split without a loss of performance on other splits. Further experiments show that in this case, searching for relevant demonstrations even with an oracle function is not sufficient to attain good performance when using meta-learning.</description>

      <title>Improving Non-autoregressive Translation Quality with Pretrained Language Model, Embedding Distillation and Upsampling Strategy for CTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-autoregressive approaches aim to improve the inference speed of translation models, particularly those that generate output in a one-pass forward manner. However, these approaches often suffer from a significant drop in translation quality compared to autoregressive models. This paper introduces a series of innovative techniques to enhance the translation quality of Non-Autoregressive Translation (NAT) models while maintaining a substantial acceleration in inference speed. We propose fine-tuning Pretrained Multilingual Language Models (PMLMs) with the CTC loss to train NAT models effectively. Furthermore, we adopt the MASK insertion scheme for up-sampling instead of token duplication, and we present an embedding distillation method to further enhance performance. In our experiments, our model outperforms the baseline autoregressive model (Transformer \textit{base}) on multiple datasets, including WMT'14 DE$\leftrightarrow$EN, WMT'16 RO$\leftrightarrow$EN, and IWSLT'14 DE$\leftrightarrow$EN. Notably, our model achieves better performance than the baseline autoregressive model on the IWSLT'14 En$\leftrightarrow$De and WMT'16 En$\leftrightarrow$Ro datasets, even without using distillation data during training. It is worth highlighting that on the IWSLT'14 DE$\rightarrow$EN dataset, our model achieves an impressive BLEU score of 39.59, setting a new state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, our model exhibits a remarkable speed improvement of 16.35 times compared to the autoregressive model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enhanced with retrieval augmentation has shown great performance in many applications. However, the computational demands for these models pose a challenge when applying them to real-time tasks, such as composition assistance. To address this, we propose Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Composition Assistance (Hybrid-RACA), a novel system for real-time text prediction that efficiently combines a cloud-based LLM with a smaller client-side model through retrieval augmented memory. This integration enables the client model to generate better responses, benefiting from the LLM's capabilities and cloud-based data. Meanwhile, via a novel asynchronous memory update mechanism, the client model can deliver real-time completions to user inputs without the need to wait for responses from the cloud. Our experiments on five datasets demonstrate that Hybrid-RACA offers strong performance while maintaining low latency.</description>

      <title>Problem-Solving Guide: Predicting the Algorithm Tags and Difficulty for Competitive Programming Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent program development industries have required problem-solving abilities for engineers, especially application developers. However, AI-based education systems to help solve computer algorithm problems have not yet attracted attention, while most big tech companies require the ability to solve algorithm problems including Google, Meta, and Amazon. The most useful guide to solving algorithm problems might be guessing the category (tag) of the facing problems. Therefore, our study addresses the task of predicting the algorithm tag as a useful tool for engineers and developers. Moreover, we also consider predicting the difficulty levels of algorithm problems, which can be used as useful guidance to calculate the required time to solve that problem. In this paper, we present a real-world algorithm problem multi-task dataset, AMT, by mainly collecting problem samples from the most famous and large competitive programming website Codeforces. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed dataset is the most large-scale dataset for predicting algorithm tags compared to previous studies. Moreover, our work is the first to address predicting the difficulty levels of algorithm problems. We present a deep learning-based novel method for simultaneously predicting algorithm tags and the difficulty levels of an algorithm problem given. All datasets and source codes are available at https://github.com/sronger/PSG_Predicting_Algorithm_Tags_and_Difficulty.</description>

      <title>Untying the Reversal Curse via Bidirectional Language Model Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) store massive factual knowledge within their parameters. But existing LLMs are prone to hallucinate unintended text due to false or outdated knowledge. Since retraining LLMs is resource intensive, there has been a growing interest in the concept of model editing. Despite the emergence of benchmarks and approaches, these unidirectional editing and evaluation have failed to explore the reversal curse. Intuitively, if "The capital of France is" is edited to be a counterfact "London" within a model, then it should be able to naturally reason and recall the reverse fact, i.e., "London is the capital of" followed by "France" instead of "England". In this paper, we study bidirectional language model editing, aiming to provide rigorous model editing evaluation to assess if edited LLMs can recall the editing knowledge bidirectionally. A new evaluation metric of reversibility is introduced, and a benchmark dubbed as Bidirectional Assessment for Knowledge Editing (BAKE) is constructed to evaluate the reversibility of edited models in recalling knowledge in the reverse direction of editing. We surprisingly observe that while current editing methods and LLMs can effectively recall editing facts in the direction of editing, they suffer serious deficiencies when evaluated in the reverse direction. To mitigate the reversal curse, a method named Bidirectionally Inversible Relationship moDeling (BIRD) is proposed. A set of editing objectives that incorporate bidirectional relationships between subject and object into the updated model weights are designed. Experiments show that BIRD improves the performance of four representative LLMs of different sizes via question answering and judgement.</description>

      <title>Alexpaca: Learning Factual Clarification Question Generation Without Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-life tasks such as giving legal or technical advice often lack complete context at the outset and can have disparate answers depending thereon. The ability to derive missing factual information by asking clarifying questions (ACQ) is an important element of real-life collaboration on such reasoning tasks. Existing factual clarification question challenges evaluate generations based on word overlap or human evaluations. Recent work explores generating a response to the clarifying question then evaluating its utility directly. So far, these tasks are limited to disambiguating the user's intent rather than concrete facts about the situation. The factual domain presents unique challenges since responses to clarification questions must be factually true for accurate evaluation. To enable evaluation of factual domain clarification question generation, We present a new task that focuses on the ability to elicit missing information in multi-hop reasoning tasks. The task, HotpotQA-FLM, can be evaluated automatically, making it convenient for benchmarking language models. We observe that humans outperform GPT-4 by a large margin, while Llama 3 8B Instruct does not even beat the dummy baseline in some metrics. Finally, we find by fine-tuning Llama 3 8B Instruct on its own generations, filtered via rejection sampling, we can improve information recovery by 27.6 percent.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the open research problem of understanding the social behaviors of LLM-based agents. Using Avalon as a testbed, we employ system prompts to guide LLM agents in gameplay. While previous studies have touched on gameplay with LLM agents, research on their social behaviors is lacking. We propose a novel framework, tailored for Avalon, features a multi-agent system facilitating efficient communication and interaction. We evaluate its performance based on game success and analyze LLM agents' social behaviors. Results affirm the framework's effectiveness in creating adaptive agents and suggest LLM-based agents' potential in navigating dynamic social interactions. By examining collaboration and confrontation behaviors, we offer insights into this field's research and applications. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/3DAgentWorld/LLM-Game-Agent.</description>

      <title>PSST: A Benchmark for Evaluation-driven Text Public-Speaking Style Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language style is necessary for AI systems to understand and generate diverse human language accurately. However, previous text style transfer primarily focused on sentence-level data-driven approaches, limiting exploration of potential problems in large language models (LLMs) and the ability to meet complex application needs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel task called Public-Speaking Style Transfer (PSST), which aims to simulate humans to transform passage-level, official texts into a public-speaking style. Grounded in the analysis of real-world data from a linguistic perspective, we decompose public-speaking style into key sub-styles to pose challenges and quantify the style modeling capability of LLMs. For such intricate text style transfer, we further propose a fine-grained evaluation framework to analyze the characteristics and identify the problems of stylized texts. Comprehensive experiments suggest that current LLMs struggle to generate public speaking texts that align with human preferences, primarily due to excessive stylization and loss of semantic information.</description>

      <title>Decoding Susceptibility: Modeling Misbelief to Misinformation Through a Computational Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Susceptibility to misinformation describes the degree of belief in unverifiable claims, a latent aspect of individuals' mental processes that is not observable. Existing susceptibility studies heavily rely on self-reported beliefs, which can be subject to bias, expensive to collect, and challenging to scale for downstream applications. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a computational approach to model users' latent susceptibility levels. As shown in previous research, susceptibility is influenced by various factors (e.g., demographic factors, political ideology), and directly influences people's reposting behavior on social media. To represent the underlying mental process, our susceptibility modeling incorporates these factors as inputs, guided by the supervision of people's sharing behavior. Using COVID-19 as a testbed domain, our experiments demonstrate a significant alignment between the susceptibility scores estimated by our computational modeling and human judgments, confirming the effectiveness of this latent modeling approach. Furthermore, we apply our model to annotate susceptibility scores on a large-scale dataset and analyze the relationships between susceptibility with various factors. Our analysis reveals that political leanings and psychological factors exhibit varying degrees of association with susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation.</description>

      <title>How Far Can We Extract Diverse Perspectives from Large Language Models?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collecting diverse human opinions is costly and challenging. This leads to a recent trend in exploiting large language models (LLMs) for generating diverse data for potential scalable and efficient solutions. However, the extent to which LLMs can generate diverse perspectives on subjective topics is still unclear. In this study, we explore LLMs' capacity of generating diverse perspectives and rationales on subjective topics such as social norms and argumentative texts. We introduce the problem of extracting maximum diversity from LLMs. Motivated by how humans form opinions based on values, we propose a criteria-based prompting technique to ground diverse opinions. To see how far we can extract diverse perspectives from LLMs, or called diversity coverage, we employ a step-by-step recall prompting to generate more outputs from the model iteratively. Our methods, applied to various tasks, show that LLMs can indeed produce diverse opinions according to the degree of task subjectivity. We also find that LLM's performance of extracting maximum diversity is on par with human.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Translations by Human, NMT, and ChatGPT: A Linguistic and Statistical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing popularity of neural machine translation (NMT) and LLMs represented by ChatGPT underscores the need for a deeper understanding of their distinct characteristics and relationships. Such understanding is crucial for language professionals and researchers to make informed decisions and tactful use of these cutting-edge translation technology, but remains underexplored. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating three key questions: (1) the distinguishability of ChatGPT-generated translations from NMT and human translation (HT), (2) the linguistic characteristics of each translation type, and (3) the degree of resemblance between ChatGPT-produced translations and HT or NMT. To achieve these objectives, we employ statistical testing, machine learning algorithms, and multidimensional analysis (MDA) to analyze Spokesperson's Remarks and their translations. After extracting a wide range of linguistic features, supervised classifiers demonstrate high accuracy in distinguishing the three translation types, whereas unsupervised clustering techniques do not yield satisfactory results. Another major finding is that ChatGPT-produced translations exhibit greater similarity with NMT than HT in most MDA dimensions, which is further corroborated by distance computing and visualization. These novel insights shed light on the interrelationships among the three translation types and have implications for the future advancements of NMT and generative AI.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce EmphAssess, a prosodic benchmark designed to evaluate the capability of speech-to-speech models to encode and reproduce prosodic emphasis. We apply this to two tasks: speech resynthesis and speech-to-speech translation. In both cases, the benchmark evaluates the ability of the model to encode emphasis in the speech input and accurately reproduce it in the output, potentially across a change of speaker and language. As part of the evaluation pipeline, we introduce EmphaClass, a new model that classifies emphasis at the frame or word level.</description>

      <title>Personalized Large Language Model Assistant with Evolving Conditional Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models, AI assistants like ChatGPT have become increasingly integrated into people's works and lives but are limited in personalized services. In this paper, we present a plug-and-play framework that could facilitate personalized large language model assistants with evolving conditional memory. The personalized assistant focuses on intelligently preserving the knowledge and experience from the history dialogue with the user, which can be applied to future tailored responses that better align with the user's preferences. Generally, the assistant generates a set of records from the dialogue dialogue, stores them in a memory bank, and retrieves related memory to improve the quality of the response. For the crucial memory design, we explore different ways of constructing the memory and propose a new memorizing mechanism named conditional memory. We also investigate the retrieval and usage of memory in the generation process. We build the first benchmark to evaluate personalized assistants' ability from three aspects. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Convergences and Divergences between Automatic Assessment and Human Evaluation: Insights from Comparing ChatGPT-Generated Translation and Neural Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated parallel and even superior translation performance compared to neural machine translation (NMT) systems. However, existing comparative studies between them mainly rely on automated metrics, raising questions into the feasibility of these metrics and their alignment with human judgment. The present study investigates the convergences and divergences between automated metrics and human evaluation in assessing the quality of machine translation from ChatGPT and three NMT systems. To perform automatic assessment, four automated metrics are employed, while human evaluation incorporates the DQF-MQM error typology and six rubrics. Notably, automatic assessment and human evaluation converge in measuring formal fidelity (e.g., error rates), but diverge when evaluating semantic and pragmatic fidelity, with automated metrics failing to capture the improvement of ChatGPT's translation brought by prompt engineering. These results underscore the indispensable role of human judgment in evaluating the performance of advanced translation tools at the current stage.</description>

      <title>Spotting LLMs With Binoculars: Zero-Shot Detection of Machine-Generated Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting text generated by modern large language models is thought to be hard, as both LLMs and humans can exhibit a wide range of complex behaviors. However, we find that a score based on contrasting two closely related language models is highly accurate at separating human-generated and machine-generated text. Based on this mechanism, we propose a novel LLM detector that only requires simple calculations using a pair of pre-trained LLMs. The method, called Binoculars, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy without any training data. It is capable of spotting machine text from a range of modern LLMs without any model-specific modifications. We comprehensively evaluate Binoculars on a number of text sources and in varied situations. Over a wide range of document types, Binoculars detects over 90% of generated samples from ChatGPT (and other LLMs) at a false positive rate of 0.01%, despite not being trained on any ChatGPT data.</description>

      <title>Conditional and Modal Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17169v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) are the topic of a growing body of research in AI and cognitive science. In this paper, we probe the extent to which twenty-nine LLMs are able to distinguish logically correct inferences from logically fallacious ones. We focus on inference patterns involving conditionals (e.g., 'If Ann has a queen, then Bob has a jack') and epistemic modals (e.g., 'Ann might have an ace', 'Bob must have a king'). These inferences have been of special interest to logicians, philosophers, and linguists, since they play a central role in the fundamental human ability to reason about distal possibilities. Assessing LLMs on these inferences is thus highly relevant to the question of how much the reasoning abilities of LLMs match those of humans. All the LLMs we tested make some basic mistakes with conditionals or modals, though zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting helps them make fewer mistakes. Even the best performing LLMs make basic errors in modal reasoning, display logically inconsistent judgments across inference patterns involving epistemic modals and conditionals, and give answers about complex conditional inferences that do not match reported human judgments. These results highlight gaps in basic logical reasoning in today's LLMs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Stagewise Pretraining via Progressive Subnetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in large language models have sparked interest in efficient pretraining methods. Stagewise training approaches to improve efficiency, like gradual stacking and layer dropping (Reddi et al, 2023; Zhang &amp; He, 2020), have recently garnered attention. The prevailing view suggests that stagewise dropping strategies, such as layer dropping, are ineffective, especially when compared to stacking-based approaches. This paper challenges this notion by demonstrating that, with proper design, dropping strategies can be competitive, if not better, than stacking methods. Specifically, we develop a principled stagewise training framework, progressive subnetwork training, which only trains subnetworks within the model and progressively increases the size of subnetworks during training, until it trains the full network. We propose an instantiation of this framework - Random Part Training (RAPTR) - that selects and trains only a random subnetwork (e.g. depth-wise, width-wise) of the network at each step, progressively increasing the size in stages. We show that this approach not only generalizes prior works like layer dropping but also fixes their key issues. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical basis for such approaches and provide justification for (a) increasing complexity of subnetworks in stages, conceptually diverging from prior works on layer dropping, and (b) stability in loss across stage transitions in presence of key modern architecture components like residual connections and layer norms. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that RAPTR can significantly speed up training of standard benchmarks like BERT and UL2, up to 33% compared to standard training and, surprisingly, also shows better downstream performance on UL2, improving QA tasks and SuperGLUE by 1.5%; thereby, providing evidence of better inductive bias.</description>

      <title>PEDANTS: Cheap but Effective and Interpretable Answer Equivalence</title>

Abstract: Question answering (QA) can only make progress if we know if an answer is correct, but current answer correctness (AC) metrics struggle with verbose, free-form answers from large language models (LLMs). There are two challenges with current short-form QA evaluations: a lack of diverse styles of evaluation data and an over-reliance on expensive and slow LLMs. LLM-based scorers correlate better with humans, but this expensive task has only been tested on limited QA datasets. We rectify these issues by providing rubrics and datasets for evaluating machine QA adopted from the Trivia community. We also propose an efficient, and interpretable QA evaluation that is more stable than an exact match and neural methods(BERTScore).</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional Evaluation of Empathetic Dialog Responses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empathy is critical for effective and satisfactory conversational communication. Prior efforts to measure conversational empathy mostly focus on expressed communicative intents -- that is, the way empathy is expressed. Yet, these works ignore the fact that conversation is also a collaboration involving both speakers and listeners. In contrast, we propose a multi-dimensional empathy evaluation framework to measure both \emph{expressed intents from the speaker's perspective} and \emph{perceived empathy from the listener's perspective}. We apply our analytical framework to examine internal customer-service dialogues. We find the two dimensions (expressed intent types and perceived empathy) are inter-connected, while perceived empathy has high correlations with dialogue satisfaction levels.
  To reduce the annotation cost, we explore different options to automatically measure conversational empathy: prompting LLMs and training language model-based classifiers. Our experiments show that prompting methods with even popular models like GPT-4 and Flan family models perform relatively poorly on both public and our internal datasets. In contrast, instruction-finetuned classifiers based on Flan-T5 family models outperform prior works and competitive baselines. We conduct a detailed ablation study to give more insights into instruction finetuning method's strong performance.</description>

      <title>Should We Respect LLMs? A Cross-Lingual Study on the Influence of Prompt Politeness on LLM Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of politeness levels in prompts on the performance of large language models (LLMs). Polite language in human communications often garners more compliance and effectiveness, while rudeness can cause aversion, impacting response quality. We consider that LLMs mirror human communication traits, suggesting they align with human cultural norms. We assess the impact of politeness in prompts on LLMs across English, Chinese, and Japanese tasks. We observed that impolite prompts often result in poor performance, but overly polite language does not guarantee better outcomes. The best politeness level is different according to the language. This phenomenon suggests that LLMs not only reflect human behavior but are also influenced by language, particularly in different cultural contexts. Our findings highlight the need to factor in politeness for cross-cultural natural language processing and LLM usage.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-based Mitigation of Evaluation Bias in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate natural language generation tasks as automated metrics. However, the likelihood, a measure of LLM's plausibility for a sentence, can vary due to superficial differences in sentences, such as word order and sentence structure. It is therefore possible that there might be a likelihood bias if LLMs are used for evaluation: they might overrate sentences with higher likelihoods while underrating those with lower likelihoods. In this paper, we investigate the presence and impact of likelihood bias in LLM-based evaluators. We also propose a method to mitigate the likelihood bias. Our method utilizes highly biased instances as few-shot examples for in-context learning. Our experiments in evaluating the data-to-text and grammatical error correction tasks reveal that several LLMs we test display a likelihood bias. Furthermore, our proposed method successfully mitigates this bias, also improving evaluation performance (in terms of correlation of models with human scores) significantly.</description>

      <title>Extreme Miscalibration and the Illusion of Adversarial Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small perturbations can cause a model to misclassify. Adversarial Training (AT) is often used to increase model robustness. However, we have discovered an intriguing phenomenon: deliberately or accidentally miscalibrating models masks gradients in a way that interferes with adversarial attack search methods, giving rise to an apparent increase in robustness. We show that this observed gain in robustness is an illusion of robustness (IOR), and demonstrate how an adversary can perform various forms of test-time temperature calibration to nullify the aforementioned interference and allow the adversarial attack to find adversarial examples. Hence, we urge the NLP community to incorporate test-time temperature scaling into their robustness evaluations to ensure that any observed gains are genuine. Finally, we show how the temperature can be scaled during \textit{training} to improve genuine robustness.</description>

      <title>Clustering and Ranking: Diversity-preserved Instruction Selection through Expert-aligned Quality Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With contributions from the open-source community, a vast amount of instruction tuning (IT) data has emerged. Given the significant resource allocation required for training and evaluating models, it is advantageous to have an efficient method for selecting high-quality IT data. However, existing methods for instruction data selection have limitations such as relying on fragile external APIs, being affected by biases in GPT models, or reducing the diversity of the selected instruction dataset. In this paper, we propose an industrial-friendly, expert-aligned and diversity-preserved instruction data selection method: Clustering and Ranking (CaR). CaR employs a two-step process: first, it ranks instruction pairs using a high-accuracy (84.25%) scoring model aligned with expert preferences; second, it preserves dataset diversity through clustering. In our experiment, CaR efficiently selected a mere 1.96% of Alpaca's IT data, yet the resulting AlpaCaR model surpassed Alpaca's performance by an average of 32.1% in GPT-4 evaluations. Moreover, we find that data selecting is a consistent paradigm whether the pre-trained model is more capable or the model parameters scaling up. Our approach employs compact models with 550M parameters and incurs just 11.2% of the financial outlay of current methods, enhancing its industrial deployability.</description>

      <title>LLM Task Interference: An Initial Study on the Impact of Task-Switch in Conversational History</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the recent emergence of powerful instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), various helpful conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have been deployed across many applications. When prompted by users, these AI systems successfully perform a wide range of tasks as part of a conversation. To provide some sort of memory and context, such approaches typically condition their output on the entire conversational history. Although this sensitivity to the conversational history can often lead to improved performance on subsequent tasks, we find that performance can in fact also be negatively impacted, if there is a task-switch. To the best of our knowledge, our work makes the first attempt to formalize the study of such vulnerabilities and interference of tasks in conversational LLMs caused by task-switches in the conversational history. Our experiments across 5 datasets with 15 task switches using popular LLMs reveal that many of the task-switches can lead to significant performance degradation.</description>

Abstract: Personalized dialogue systems have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to generate responses in alignment with different personas. However, most existing approaches rely on pre-defined personal profiles, which are not only time-consuming and labor-intensive to create but also lack flexibility. We propose In-Dialogue Learning (IDL), a fine-tuning framework that enhances the ability of pre-trained large language models to leverage dialogue history to characterize persona for completing personalized dialogue generation tasks without pre-defined profiles. Our experiments on three datasets demonstrate that IDL brings substantial improvements, with BLEU and ROUGE scores increasing by up to 200% and 247%, respectively. Additionally, the results of human evaluations further validate the efficacy of our proposed method.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are excelling across various tasks despite not being based on human cognition, prompting an investigation into their potential to offer insights into human cognitive mechanisms. This study examines ChatGPT's ability to predict human performance in a language-based memory task. Following theories of text comprehension, we hypothesized that recognizing ambiguous sentences is easier with relevant preceding context. Participants, including humans and ChatGPT, were given pairs of sentences: the second always a garden-path sentence, and the first providing either fitting or unfitting context. We measured their ratings of sentence relatedness and memorability. Results showed a strong alignment between ChatGPT's assessments and human memory performance. Sentences in the fitting context were rated as being more related and memorable by ChatGPT and were better remembered by humans, highlighting LLMs' potential to predict human performance and contribute to psychological theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Streaming text generation has become a common way of increasing the responsiveness of language model powered applications, such as chat assistants. At the same time, extracting semantic information from generated text is a useful tool for applications such as automated fact checking or retrieval augmented generation. Currently, this requires either separate models during inference, which increases computational cost, or destructive fine-tuning of the language model. Instead, we propose an approach called EMBER which enables streaming named entity recognition in decoder-only language models without fine-tuning them and while incurring minimal additional computational cost at inference time. Specifically, our experiments show that EMBER maintains high token generation rates, with only a negligible decrease in speed of around 1% compared to a 43.64% slowdown measured for a baseline. We make our code and data available online, including a toolkit for training, testing, and deploying efficient token classification models optimized for streaming text generation.</description>

      <title>LARA: Linguistic-Adaptive Retrieval-Augmentation for Multi-Turn Intent Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-turn intent classification is notably challenging due to the complexity and evolving nature of conversational contexts. This paper introduces LARA, a Linguistic-Adaptive Retrieval-Augmentation framework to enhance accuracy in multi-turn classification tasks across six languages, accommodating a large number of intents in chatbot interactions. LARA combines a fine-tuned smaller model with a retrieval-augmented mechanism, integrated within the architecture of LLMs. The integration allows LARA to dynamically utilize past dialogues and relevant intents, thereby improving the understanding of the context. Furthermore, our adaptive retrieval techniques bolster the cross-lingual capabilities of LLMs without extensive retraining and fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LARA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-turn intent classification tasks, enhancing the average accuracy by 3.67\% from state-of-the-art single-turn intent classifiers.</description>

      <title>Streamlining Redundant Layers to Compress Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19135v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-Streamline, a pioneer work on layer pruning for large language models (LLMs). It is based on the observation that different layers have varying impacts on hidden states, enabling the identification of less important layers to be pruned.LLM-Streamline comprises two parts: layer pruning, which removes consecutive layers with the lowest importance based on target sparsity, and layer replacement, a novel module that trains a lightweight network to replace the pruned layers to mitigate performance loss. Additionally, a new metric called stability is proposed to address the limitations of the widely used accuracy metric in evaluating model compression. Experiments show that LLM-Streamline outperforms both previous and concurrent state-of-the-art pruning methods in terms of both performance and training efficiency.</description>

      <title>AutoWebGLM: A Large Language Model-based Web Navigating Agent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have fueled many intelligent web agents, but most existing ones perform far from satisfying in real-world web navigation tasks due to three factors: (1) the complexity of HTML text data (2) versatility of actions on webpages, and (3) task difficulty due to the open-domain nature of the web. In light of these challenges, we develop the open AutoWebGLM based on ChatGLM3-6B. AutoWebGLM can serve as a powerful automated web navigation agent that outperform GPT-4. Inspired by human browsing patterns, we first design an HTML simplification algorithm to represent webpages with vital information preserved succinctly. We then employ a hybrid human-AI method to build web browsing data for curriculum training. Finally, we bootstrap the model by reinforcement learning and rejection sampling to further facilitate webpage comprehension, browser operations, and efficient task decomposition by itself. For comprehensive evaluation, we establish a bilingual benchmark -- AutoWebBench -- for real-world web navigation tasks. We evaluate AutoWebGLM across diverse web navigation benchmarks, demonstrating its potential to tackle challenging tasks in real environments. Related code, model, and data are released at \url{https://github.com/THUDM/AutoWebGLM}.</description>

      <title>Reuse Your Rewards: Reward Model Transfer for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aligning language models (LMs) based on human-annotated preference data is a crucial step in obtaining practical and performant LM-based systems. However, multilingual human preference data are difficult to obtain at scale, making it challenging to extend this framework to diverse languages. In this work, we evaluate a simple approach for zero-shot cross-lingual alignment, where a reward model is trained on preference data in one source language and directly applied to other target languages. On summarization and open-ended dialog generation, we show that this method is consistently successful under comprehensive evaluation settings, including human evaluation: cross-lingually aligned models are preferred by humans over unaligned models on up to &gt;70% of evaluation instances. We moreover find that a different-language reward model sometimes yields better aligned models than a same-language reward model. We also identify best practices when there is no language-specific data for even supervised finetuning, another component in alignment.</description>

      <title>Differential contributions of machine learning and statistical analysis to language and cognitive sciences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven approaches have revolutionized scientific research, with machine learning and statistical analysis being commonly used methodologies. Despite their widespread use, these approaches differ significantly in their techniques, objectives and implementations. Few studies have systematically applied both methods to identical datasets to highlight potential differences, particularly in language and cognitive sciences. This study employs the Buckeye Speech Corpus to illustrate how machine learning and statistical analysis are applied in data-driven research to obtain distinct insights on language production. We demonstrate the theoretical differences, implementation steps, and unique objectives of each approach through a comprehensive, tutorial-like comparison. Our analysis reveals that while machine learning excels at pattern recognition and prediction, statistical methods provide deeper insights into relationships between variables. The study highlights how semantic relevance, a novel metric measuring contextual influence on target words, contributes to understanding word duration in speech. We also systematically compare the differences between regression models used in machine learning and statistical analysis, particularly focusing on the training and fitting processes. Additionally, we clarify several common misconceptions that contribute to the confusion between these two approaches. Overall, by elucidating the complementary strengths of machine learning and statistics, this research enhances our understanding of diverse data-driven strategies in language and cognitive sciences, offering researchers valuable guidance on when and how to effectively apply these approaches in different research contexts.</description>

      <title>Don't Say No: Jailbreaking LLM by Suppressing Refusal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial to generating responses consistent with human values. Despite their ability to recognize and avoid harmful queries, LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where carefully crafted prompts seduce them to produce toxic content. One category of jailbreak attacks is reformulating the task as an optimization by eliciting the LLM to generate affirmative responses. However, such optimization objective has its own limitations, such as the restriction on the predefined objectionable behaviors, leading to suboptimal attack performance. In this study, we first uncover the reason why vanilla target loss is not optimal, then we explore and enhance the loss objective and introduce the DSN (Don't Say No) attack, which achieves successful attack by suppressing refusal. Another challenge in studying jailbreak attacks is the evaluation, as it is difficult to directly and accurately assess the harmfulness of the responses. The existing evaluation such as refusal keyword matching reveals numerous false positive and false negative instances. To overcome this challenge, we propose an Ensemble Evaluation pipeline that novelly incorporates Natural Language Inference (NLI) contradiction assessment and two external LLM evaluators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the potential of the DSN and effectiveness of Ensemble Evaluation compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>EMS-SD: Efficient Multi-sample Speculative Decoding for Accelerating Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speculative decoding emerges as a pivotal technique for enhancing the inference speed of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite recent research aiming to improve prediction efficiency, multi-sample speculative decoding has been overlooked due to varying numbers of accepted tokens within a batch in the verification phase. Vanilla method adds padding tokens in order to ensure that the number of new tokens remains consistent across samples. However, this increases the computational and memory access overhead, thereby reducing the speedup ratio. We propose a novel method that can resolve the issue of inconsistent tokens accepted by different samples without necessitating an increase in memory or computing overhead. Furthermore, our proposed method can handle the situation where the prediction tokens of different samples are inconsistent without the need to add padding tokens. Sufficient experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/niyunsheng/EMS-SD.</description>

      <title>NoiseBench: Benchmarking the Impact of Real Label Noise on Named Entity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Available training data for named entity recognition (NER) often contains a significant percentage of incorrect labels for entity types and entity boundaries. Such label noise poses challenges for supervised learning and may significantly deteriorate model quality. To address this, prior work proposed various noise-robust learning approaches capable of learning from data with partially incorrect labels. These approaches are typically evaluated using simulated noise where the labels in a clean dataset are automatically corrupted. However, as we show in this paper, this leads to unrealistic noise that is far easier to handle than real noise caused by human error or semi-automatic annotation. To enable the study of the impact of various types of real noise, we introduce NoiseBench, an NER benchmark consisting of clean training data corrupted with 6 types of real noise, including expert errors, crowdsourcing errors, automatic annotation errors and LLM errors. We present an analysis that shows that real noise is significantly more challenging than simulated noise, and show that current state-of-the-art models for noise-robust learning fall far short of their theoretically achievable upper bound. We release NoiseBench to the research community.</description>

Abstract: Scientific language models drive research innovation but require extensive fine-tuning on large datasets. This work enhances such models by improving their inference and evaluation capabilities with minimal or no additional training. Focusing on molecule caption generation, we explore synergies between alignment fine-tuning and model merging in a cross-modal setup. We reveal intriguing insights into the behaviour and suitability of such methods while significantly surpassing state-of-the-art models. Moreover, we propose a novel atomic-level evaluation method leveraging off-the-shelf Natural Language Inference (NLI) models for use in the unseen chemical domain. Our experiments demonstrate that our evaluation operates at the right level of granularity, effectively handling multiple content units and subsentence reasoning, while widely adopted NLI methods consistently misalign with assessment criteria.</description>

      <title>Process-Driven Autoformalization in Lean 4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autoformalization, the conversion of natural language mathematics into formal languages, offers significant potential for advancing mathematical reasoning. However, existing efforts are limited to formal languages with substantial online corpora and struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving languages like Lean 4. To bridge this gap, we propose a new benchmark \textbf{Form}alization for \textbf{L}ean~\textbf{4} (\textbf{\name}) designed to evaluate the autoformalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs). This benchmark encompasses a comprehensive assessment of questions, answers, formal statements, and proofs. Additionally, we introduce a \textbf{P}rocess-\textbf{S}upervised \textbf{V}erifier (\textbf{PSV}) model that leverages the precise feedback from Lean 4 compilers to enhance autoformalization. Our experiments demonstrate that the PSV method improves autoformalization, enabling higher accuracy using less filtered training data. Furthermore, when fine-tuned with data containing detailed process information, PSV can leverage the data more effectively, leading to more significant improvements in autoformalization for Lean 4. Our dataset and code are available at \url{https://github.com/rookie-joe/PDA}.</description>

      <title>Self-Control of LLM Behaviors by Compressing Suffix Gradient into Prefix Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose SelfControl, an inference-time model control method utilizing gradients to control the behavior of large language models (LLMs) without explicit human annotations. Given a desired behavior expressed in a natural language suffix string concatenated to the input prompt, SelfControl computes gradients of the LLM's self-evaluation of the suffix with respect to its latent representations. The gradients are used to directly control the auto-regressive generation process towards desired behaviors, which eliminates human supervision, achieves precise and transparent control, and offers on-the-fly adaptability. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce SelfControl_{Prefix}, a compact module that encapsulates the learned representations from gradients into a SelfControl_{Prefix}, facilitating efficient inference-time control with no latency compared to the original model and allowing control for multiple behaviors simultaneously. Our experiments demonstrate SelfControl's efficacy across multiple domains, where it improves over SOTA for 8.3% in detoxification, 3.1% in truthfulness enhancement, 4%~10% in controlling on emotion tones, and 48.2% in privacy protection, i.e., completely remove privacy leakage issue. Additionally, we demonstrate that SelfControl can be used for data synthesis and to improve reasoning abilities.</description>

      <title>RATT: A Thought Structure for Coherent and Correct LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02746v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) gain substantial reasoning and decision-making capabilities from thought structures. However, existing methods such as Tree of Thought and Retrieval Augmented Thoughts often fall short in complex tasks due to the limitations of insufficient local retrieval of factual knowledge and inadequate global selection of strategies. These limitations make it challenging for these methods to balance factual accuracy and comprehensive logical optimization effectively. To address these limitations, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Thought Tree (RATT), a novel thought structure that considers both overall logical soundness and factual correctness at each step of the thinking process. Specifically, at every point of a thought branch, RATT performs planning and lookahead to explore and evaluate multiple potential reasoning steps, and integrate the fact-checking ability of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLM's ability to assess overall strategy. Through this combination of factual knowledge and strategic feasibility, the RATT adjusts and integrates the thought tree structure to search for the most promising branches within the search space. This thought structure significantly enhances the model's coherence in logical inference and efficiency in decision-making, and thus increases the limit of the capacity of LLM to generate reliable inferences and decisions based on thought structures. A broad range of experiments on different types of tasks showcases that the RATT structure significantly outperforms existing methods in factual correctness and logical coherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often do not perform well on queries that require the aggregation of information across texts. To better evaluate this setting and facilitate modeling efforts, we introduce TACT - Text And Calculations through Tables, a dataset crafted to evaluate LLMs' reasoning and computational abilities using complex instructions. TACT contains challenging instructions that demand stitching information scattered across one or more texts, and performing complex integration on this information to generate the answer. We construct this dataset by leveraging an existing dataset of texts and their associated tables. For each such tables, we formulate new queries, and gather their respective answers. We demonstrate that all contemporary LLMs perform poorly on this dataset, achieving an accuracy below 38%. To pinpoint the difficulties and thoroughly dissect the problem, we analyze model performance across three components: table-generation, Pandas command-generation, and execution. Unexpectedly, we discover that each component presents substantial challenges for current LLMs. These insights lead us to propose a focused modeling framework, which we refer to as IE as a tool. Specifically, we propose to add "tools" for each of the above steps, and implement each such tool with few-shot prompting. This approach shows an improvement over existing prompting techniques, offering a promising direction for enhancing model capabilities in these tasks.</description>

      <title>Buffer of Thoughts: Thought-Augmented Reasoning with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Buffer of Thoughts (BoT), a novel and versatile thought-augmented reasoning approach for enhancing accuracy, efficiency and robustness of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we propose meta-buffer to store a series of informative high-level thoughts, namely thought-template, distilled from the problem-solving processes across various tasks. Then for each problem, we retrieve a relevant thought-template and adaptively instantiate it with specific reasoning structures to conduct efficient reasoning. To guarantee the scalability and stability, we further propose buffer-manager to dynamically update the meta-buffer, thus enhancing the capacity of meta-buffer as more tasks are solved. We conduct extensive experiments on 10 challenging reasoning-intensive tasks, and achieve significant performance improvements over previous SOTA methods: 11% on Game of 24, 20% on Geometric Shapes and 51% on Checkmate-in-One. Further analysis demonstrate the superior generalization ability and model robustness of our BoT, while requiring only 12% of the cost of multi-query prompting methods (e.g., tree/graph of thoughts) on average. Notably, we find that our Llama3-8B+BoT has the potential to surpass Llama3-70B model. Our project is available at: https://github.com/YangLing0818/buffer-of-thought-llm</description>

      <title>MixEval: Deriving Wisdom of the Crowd from LLM Benchmark Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is challenging. Traditional ground-truth-based benchmarks fail to capture the comprehensiveness and nuance of real-world queries, while LLM-as-judge benchmarks suffer from grading biases and limited query quantity. Both of them may also become contaminated over time. User-facing evaluation, such as Chatbot Arena, provides reliable signals but is costly and slow. In this work, we propose MixEval, a new paradigm for establishing efficient, gold-standard LLM evaluation by strategically mixing off-the-shelf benchmarks. It bridges (1) comprehensive and well-distributed real-world user queries and (2) efficient and fairly-graded ground-truth-based benchmarks, by matching queries mined from the web with similar queries from existing benchmarks. Based on MixEval, we further build MixEval-Hard, which offers more room for model improvement. Our benchmarks' advantages lie in (1) a 0.96 model ranking correlation with Chatbot Arena arising from the highly impartial query distribution and grading mechanism, (2) fast, cheap, and reproducible execution (6% of the time and cost of MMLU), and (3) dynamic evaluation enabled by the rapid and stable data update pipeline. We provide extensive meta-evaluation and analysis for our and existing LLM benchmarks to deepen the community's understanding of LLM evaluation and guide future research directions.</description>

      <title>$\textbf{PLUM}$: Improving Code LMs with Execution-Guided On-Policy Preference Learning Driven By Synthetic Test Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06887v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preference learning provides a promising solution to address the limitations of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for code language models, where the model is not explicitly trained to differentiate between correct and incorrect code. Recent findings demonstrate that on-policy data is the key to successful preference learning, where the preference data is collected using the same policy LM being trained. Inspired by this, we propose PLUM, an on-policy $\textbf{P}$reference $\textbf{L}$earning framework A$\textbf{u}$gmented with test cases for code L$\textbf{M}$ s. The framework operates in three key stages: (1) automatic generation of test cases from natural language instructions, (2) creation of a preference data by evaluating candidate code solutions sampled from the policy, which can then be used to (3) train the policy LM. PLUM levitates the need to train reward models, allowing for large scale on-policy and online preference data collation. PLUM is evaluated on both standard benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP) and more challenging ones (LiveCodeBench), delivering substantial improvements over original SFT'ed models and other execution-feedback-driven approaches. We show PLUM's benefits are consistent across various widely-used code LMs even they have been well-trained with SFT. For example, PLUM increases pass rates by up to 4.8% on average on standard benchmarks and 11.8% on LiveCodeBench, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability. We also demonstrate the benefits of on-policy and online preference learning by comprehensive experimentation.</description>

      <title>Designing a Dashboard for Transparency and Control of Conversational AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conversational LLMs function as black box systems, leaving users guessing about why they see the output they do. This lack of transparency is potentially problematic, especially given concerns around bias and truthfulness. To address this issue, we present an end-to-end prototype-connecting interpretability techniques with user experience design-that seeks to make chatbots more transparent. We begin by showing evidence that a prominent open-source LLM has a "user model": examining the internal state of the system, we can extract data related to a user's age, gender, educational level, and socioeconomic status. Next, we describe the design of a dashboard that accompanies the chatbot interface, displaying this user model in real time. The dashboard can also be used to control the user model and the system's behavior. Finally, we discuss a study in which users conversed with the instrumented system. Our results suggest that users appreciate seeing internal states, which helped them expose biased behavior and increased their sense of control. Participants also made valuable suggestions that point to future directions for both design and machine learning research.

      <title>CliBench: A Multifaceted and Multigranular Evaluation of Large Language Models for Clinical Decision Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially Large Language Models (LLMs), into the clinical diagnosis process offers significant potential to improve the efficiency and accessibility of medical care. While LLMs have shown some promise in the medical domain, their application in clinical diagnosis remains underexplored, especially in real-world clinical practice, where highly sophisticated, patient-specific decisions need to be made. Current evaluations of LLMs in this field are often narrow in scope, focusing on specific diseases or specialties and employing simplified diagnostic tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce CliBench, a novel benchmark developed from the MIMIC IV dataset, offering a comprehensive and realistic assessment of LLMs' capabilities in clinical diagnosis. This benchmark not only covers diagnoses from a diverse range of medical cases across various specialties but also incorporates tasks of clinical significance: treatment procedure identification, lab test ordering and medication prescriptions. Supported by structured output ontologies, CliBench enables a precise and multi-granular evaluation, offering an in-depth understanding of LLM's capability on diverse clinical tasks of desired granularity. We conduct a zero-shot evaluation of leading LLMs to assess their proficiency in clinical decision-making. Our preliminary results shed light on the potential and limitations of current LLMs in clinical settings, providing valuable insights for future advancements in LLM-powered healthcare.</description>

      <title>Know the Unknown: An Uncertainty-Sensitive Method for LLM Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but still face challenges such as hallucinations. One potential reason for hallucinations is the lack of relevant knowledge or context. Thus, a promising solution involves instructing LLMs to respond with "I do not know" when a question falls outside their knowledge domain or the provided context. However, in this work, we observed that LLMs struggle to admit their lack of knowledge, primarily due to existing instruction datasets designed to encourage specific answers. To improve models' capability to recognize the boundaries of their knowledge, we propose a novel approach called uncertainty-sensitive tuning. This method involves two-stage training designed for uncertainty recognition and prompt-sensitive activation. In the first stage, we guide the LLM to reject unknown questions. In the second stage, we force the model to follow the instructions by incorporating designed causal instructions. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed uncertainty-sensitive tuning method enhance the model's ability to identify areas of uncertainty. Specifically, it achieves a substantial improvement of up to 34.7% in handling questions involving knowledge gaps compared to the original model. Moreover, our finetuned models even outperform GPT-4, exhibiting an overall performance improvement of up to 4.2%.</description>

      <title>MIND: Multimodal Shopping Intention Distillation from Large Vision-language Models for E-commerce Purchase Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improving user experience and providing personalized search results in E-commerce platforms heavily rely on understanding purchase intention. However, existing methods for acquiring large-scale intentions bank on distilling large language models with human annotation for verification. Such an approach tends to generate product-centric intentions, overlook valuable visual information from product images, and incurs high costs for scalability. To address these issues, we introduce MIND, a multimodal framework that allows Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to infer purchase intentions from multimodal product metadata and prioritize human-centric ones. Using Amazon Review data, we apply MIND and create a multimodal intention knowledge base, which contains 1,264,441 million intentions derived from 126,142 co-buy shopping records across 107,215 products. Extensive human evaluations demonstrate the high plausibility and typicality of our obtained intentions and validate the effectiveness of our distillation framework and filtering mechanism. Additional experiments reveal that our obtained intentions significantly enhance large language models in two intention comprehension tasks.</description>

      <title>Demonstration Organization via Logit Separability: Advancing In-Context Learning through Multiple Class-Related Words</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10908v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective organization of in-context learning (ICL) demonstrations is key to improving the quality of large language model (LLM) responses. To create better demonstrations that guide LLM understanding, we introduce logit separability, a criterion to assess the clarity of both samples and class-related words at the logit level. This facilitates the optimization of sample and label selection, enhancing the precision of information provided in ICL demonstrations. Additionally, we find that incorporating multiple class-related words for each sample, rather than relying on a single class name, improves performance by offering a broader range of label information. Building on these insights, we propose LICL, a logit separability-based method that jointly organizes samples and integrates multiple class-related words into each sample-label pair. Evaluations across seven classification datasets show that this approach significantly improves ICL performance by providing clearer instructions and richer label information.</description>

Abstract: Modeling legal reasoning and argumentation justifying decisions in cases has always been central to AI &amp; Law, yet contemporary developments in legal NLP have increasingly focused on statistically classifying legal conclusions from text. While conceptually simpler, these approaches often fall short in providing usable justifications connecting to appropriate legal concepts. This paper reviews both traditional symbolic works in AI &amp; Law and recent advances in legal NLP, and distills possibilities of integrating expert-informed knowledge to strike a balance between scalability and explanation in symbolic vs. data-driven approaches.

      <title>Investigating Annotator Bias in Large Language Models for Hate Speech Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data annotation, the practice of assigning descriptive labels to raw data, is pivotal in optimizing the performance of machine learning models. However, it is a resource-intensive process susceptible to biases introduced by annotators. The emergence of sophisticated Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT presents a unique opportunity to modernize and streamline this complex procedure. While existing research extensively evaluates the efficacy of LLMs, as annotators, this paper delves into the biases present in LLMs, specifically GPT 3.5 and GPT 4o when annotating hate speech data. Our research contributes to understanding biases in four key categories: gender, race, religion, and disability. Specifically targeting highly vulnerable groups within these categories, we analyze annotator biases. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive examination of potential factors contributing to these biases by scrutinizing the annotated data. We introduce our custom hate speech detection dataset, HateSpeechCorpus, to conduct this research. Additionally, we perform the same experiments on the ETHOS (Mollas et al., 2022) dataset also for comparative analysis. This paper serves as a crucial resource, guiding researchers and practitioners in harnessing the potential of LLMs for dataannotation, thereby fostering advancements in this critical field.

      <title>Fairer Preferences Elicit Improved Human-Aligned Large Language Model Judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising abilities as cost-effective and reference-free evaluators for assessing language generation quality. In particular, pairwise LLM evaluators, which compare two generated texts and determine the preferred one, have been employed in a wide range of applications. However, LLMs exhibit preference biases and worrying sensitivity to prompt designs. In this work, we first reveal that the predictive preference of LLMs can be highly brittle and skewed, even with semantically equivalent instructions. We find that fairer predictive preferences from LLMs consistently lead to judgments that are better aligned with humans. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose an automatic Zero-shot Evaluation-oriented Prompt Optimization framework, ZEPO, which aims to produce fairer preference decisions and improve the alignment of LLM evaluators with human judgments. To this end, we propose a zero-shot learning objective based on the preference decision fairness. ZEPO demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art LLM evaluators, without requiring labeled data, on representative meta-evaluation benchmarks. Our findings underscore the critical correlation between preference fairness and human alignment, positioning ZEPO as an efficient prompt optimizer for bridging the gap between LLM evaluators and human judgments.</description>

Abstract: Cultural variation exists between nations (e.g., the United States vs. China), but also within regions (e.g., California vs. Texas, Los Angeles vs. San Francisco). Measuring this regional cultural variation can illuminate how and why people think and behave differently. Historically, it has been difficult to computationally model cultural variation due to a lack of training data and scalability constraints. In this work, we introduce a new research problem for the NLP community: How do we measure variation in cultural constructs across regions using language? We then provide a scalable solution: building knowledge-guided lexica to model cultural variation, encouraging future work at the intersection of NLP and cultural understanding. We also highlight modern LLMs' failure to measure cultural variation or generate culturally varied language.</description>

      <title>Defending Against Social Engineering Attacks in the Age of LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) poses challenges in detecting and mitigating digital deception, as these models can emulate human conversational patterns and facilitate chat-based social engineering (CSE) attacks. This study investigates the dual capabilities of LLMs as both facilitators and defenders against CSE threats. We develop a novel dataset, SEConvo, simulating CSE scenarios in academic and recruitment contexts, and designed to examine how LLMs can be exploited in these situations. Our findings reveal that, while off-the-shelf LLMs generate high-quality CSE content, their detection capabilities are suboptimal, leading to increased operational costs for defense. In response, we propose ConvoSentinel, a modular defense pipeline that improves detection at both the message and the conversation levels, offering enhanced adaptability and cost-effectiveness. The retrieval-augmented module in ConvoSentinel identifies malicious intent by comparing messages to a database of similar conversations, enhancing CSE detection at all stages. Our study highlights the need for advanced strategies to leverage LLMs in cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>Bridging Local Details and Global Context in Text-Attributed Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Representation learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) is vital for real-world applications, as they combine semantic textual and contextual structural information. Research in this field generally consist of two main perspectives: local-level encoding and global-level aggregating, respectively refer to textual node information unification (e.g., using Language Models) and structure-augmented modeling (e.g., using Graph Neural Networks). Most existing works focus on combining different information levels but overlook the interconnections, i.e., the contextual textual information among nodes, which provides semantic insights to bridge local and global levels. In this paper, we propose GraphBridge, a multi-granularity integration framework that bridges local and global perspectives by leveraging contextual textual information, enhancing fine-grained understanding of TAGs. Besides, to tackle scalability and efficiency challenges, we introduce a graphaware token reduction module. Extensive experiments across various models and datasets show that our method achieves state-of-theart performance, while our graph-aware token reduction module significantly enhances efficiency and solves scalability issues.</description>

      <title>AgentReview: Exploring Peer Review Dynamics with LLM Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peer review is fundamental to the integrity and advancement of scientific publication. Traditional methods of peer review analyses often rely on exploration and statistics of existing peer review data, which do not adequately address the multivariate nature of the process, account for the latent variables, and are further constrained by privacy concerns due to the sensitive nature of the data. We introduce AgentReview, the first large language model (LLM) based peer review simulation framework, which effectively disentangles the impacts of multiple latent factors and addresses the privacy issue. Our study reveals significant insights, including a notable 37.1% variation in paper decisions due to reviewers' biases, supported by sociological theories such as the social influence theory, altruism fatigue, and authority bias. We believe that this study could offer valuable insights to improve the design of peer review mechanisms. Our code is available at https://github.com/Ahren09/AgentReview.</description>

      <title>Hopping Too Late: Exploring the Limitations of Large Language Models on Multi-Hop Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can solve complex multi-step problems, but little is known about how these computations are implemented internally. Motivated by this, we study how LLMs answer multi-hop queries such as "The spouse of the performer of Imagine is". These queries require two information extraction steps: a latent one for resolving the first hop ("the performer of Imagine") into the bridge entity (John Lennon), and another for resolving the second hop ("the spouse of John Lennon") into the target entity (Yoko Ono). Understanding how the latent step is computed internally is key to understanding the overall computation. By carefully analyzing the internal computations of transformer-based LLMs, we discover that the bridge entity is resolved in the early layers of the model. Then, only after this resolution, the two-hop query is solved in the later layers. Because the second hop commences in later layers, there could be cases where these layers no longer encode the necessary knowledge for correctly predicting the answer. Motivated by this, we propose a novel "back-patching" analysis method whereby a hidden representation from a later layer is patched back to an earlier layer. We find that in up to 66% of previously incorrect cases there exists a back-patch that results in the correct generation of the answer, showing that the later layers indeed sometimes lack the needed functionality. Overall, our methods and findings open further opportunities for understanding and improving latent reasoning in transformer-based LLMs.</description>

      <title>Translating Across Cultures: LLMs for Intralingual Cultural Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLMs are increasingly being deployed for multilingual applications and have demonstrated impressive translation capabilities between several low and high-resource languages. An aspect of translation that often gets overlooked is that of cultural adaptation, or modifying source culture references to suit the target culture. While specialized translation models still outperform LLMs on the machine translation task when viewed from the lens of correctness, they are not sensitive to cultural differences often requiring manual correction. LLMs on the other hand have a rich reservoir of cultural knowledge embedded within its parameters that can be potentially exploited for such applications. In this paper, we define the task of cultural adaptation and create an evaluation framework to evaluate the performance of modern LLMs for cultural adaptation and analyze their cross-cultural knowledge while connecting related concepts across different cultures. We also analyze possible issues with automatic adaptation. We hope that this task will offer more insight into the cultural understanding of LLMs and their creativity in cross-cultural scenarios.</description>

      <title>How to Compute the Probability of a Word</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) estimate a probability distribution over strings in a natural language; these distributions are crucial for computing perplexity and surprisal in linguistics research. While we are usually concerned with measuring these values for words, most LMs operate over subwords. Despite seemingly straightforward, accurately computing probabilities over one unit given probabilities over the other requires care. Indeed, we show here that many recent linguistic studies have been incorrectly computing these values. This paper derives the correct methods for computing word probabilities, highlighting issues when relying on language models that use beginning-of-word (bow)-marking tokenisers, e.g., the GPT family. Empirically, we show that correcting the widespread bug in probability computations affects measured outcomes in sentence comprehension and lexical optimisation analyses.</description>

      <title>Twin-Merging: Dynamic Integration of Modular Expertise in Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of large language models, model merging is a promising way to combine multiple task-specific models into a single multitask model without extra training. However, two challenges remain: (a) interference between different models and (b) heterogeneous data during testing. Traditional model merging methods often show significant performance gaps compared to fine-tuned models due to these issues. Additionally, a one-size-fits-all model lacks flexibility for diverse test data, leading to performance degradation. We show that both shared and exclusive task-specific knowledge are crucial for merging performance, but directly merging exclusive knowledge hinders overall performance. In view of this, we propose Twin-Merging, a method that encompasses two principal stages: (1) modularizing knowledge into shared and exclusive components, with compression to reduce redundancy and enhance efficiency; (2) dynamically merging shared and task-specific knowledge based on the input. This approach narrows the performance gap between merged and fine-tuned models and improves adaptability to heterogeneous data. Extensive experiments on $20$ datasets for both language and vision tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing an average improvement of $28.34\%$ in absolute normalized score for discriminative tasks and even surpassing the fine-tuned upper bound on the generative tasks. Our implementation is available in \url{https://github.com/LZY-the-boys/Twin-Merging}</description>

      <title>On Giant's Shoulders: Effortless Weak to Strong by Dynamic Logits Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning of large language models for task-specific applications is imperative, yet the vast number of parameters in these models makes their training increasingly challenging. Despite numerous proposals for effective methods, a substantial memory overhead remains for gradient computations during updates. \thm{Can we fine-tune a series of task-specific small models and transfer their knowledge directly to a much larger model without additional training?} In this paper, we explore weak-to-strong specialization using logit arithmetic, facilitating a direct answer to this question. Existing weak-to-strong methods often employ a static knowledge transfer ratio and a single small model for transferring complex knowledge, which leads to suboptimal performance. % To address this, To surmount these limitations, we propose a dynamic logit fusion approach that works with a series of task-specific small models, each specialized in a different task. This method adaptively allocates weights among these models at each decoding step, learning the weights through Kullback-Leibler divergence constrained optimization problems. We conduct extensive experiments across various benchmarks in both single-task and multi-task settings, achieving leading results. By transferring expertise from the 7B model to the 13B model, our method closes the performance gap by 96.4\% in single-task scenarios and by 86.3\% in multi-task scenarios compared to full fine-tuning of the 13B model. Notably, we achieve surpassing performance on unseen tasks. Moreover, we further demonstrate that our method can effortlessly integrate in-context learning for single tasks and task arithmetic for multi-task scenarios.</description>

      <title>Debate-to-Write: A Persona-Driven Multi-Agent Framework for Diverse Argument Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Writing persuasive arguments is a challenging task for both humans and machines. It entails incorporating high-level beliefs from various perspectives on the topic, along with deliberate reasoning and planning to construct a coherent narrative. Current language models often generate surface tokens autoregressively, lacking explicit integration of these underlying controls, resulting in limited output diversity and coherence. In this work, we propose a persona-based multi-agent framework for argument writing. Inspired by the human debate, we first assign each agent a persona representing its high-level beliefs from a unique perspective, and then design an agent interaction process so that the agents can collaboratively debate and discuss the idea to form an overall plan for argument writing. Such debate process enables fluid and nonlinear development of ideas. We evaluate our framework on argumentative essay writing. The results show that our framework can generate more diverse and persuasive arguments through both automatic and human evaluations.</description>

      <title>Calibrating LLMs with Preference Optimization on Thought Trees for Generating Rationale in Science Question Scoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating rationales that justify scoring decisions has been a promising way to facilitate explainability in automated scoring systems. However, existing methods do not match the accuracy of classifier-based methods. Plus, the generated rationales often contain hallucinated information. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework capable of generating more faithful rationales and, more importantly, matching performance with classifier-based black-box scoring systems. We first mimic the human assessment process by querying Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a thought tree. We then summarise intermediate assessment decisions from each thought tree path for creating synthetic rationale data and rationale preference data. Finally, we utilise the generated synthetic data to calibrate LLMs through a two-step training process: supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a 38% assessment performance improvement in the QWK score compared to prior work while producing higher-quality rationales, as recognised by human evaluators and LLMs. Our work sheds light on the effectiveness of performing preference optimization using synthetic preference data obtained from thought tree paths. Data and code are available at https://github.com/lijiazheng99/thought_tree_assessment.</description>

      <title>Turning Up the Heat: Min-p Sampling for Creative and Coherent LLM Outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate text by sampling the next token from a probability distribution over the vocabulary at each decoding step. However, popular sampling methods like top-p (nucleus sampling) often struggle to balance quality and diversity, especially at higher temperatures, leading to incoherent or repetitive outputs. To address this challenge, we propose min-p sampling, a dynamic truncation method that adjusts the sampling threshold based on the model's confidence by scaling according to the top token's probability. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmarks including GPQA, GSM8K, and AlpacaEval Creative Writing, demonstrating that min-p sampling improves both the quality and diversity of generated text, particularly at high temperatures. Moreover, human evaluations reveal a clear preference for min-p sampling in terms of both text quality and diversity. Min-p sampling has been adopted by multiple open-source LLM implementations, highlighting its practical utility and potential impact.</description>

      <title>Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning for Speech Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been increasing interest in building multilingual foundation models for NLP and speech research. This paper examines how to expand the speech translation capability of these models with restricted data. Whisper, a speech foundation model with strong performance on speech recognition and English translation, is used as the example model. Using speech-to-speech retrieval to analyse the audio representations generated by the encoder, we show that utterances from different languages are mapped to a shared semantic space. This shared embedding space can then be leveraged for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in speech translation. By fine-tuning the Whisper decoder with only English-to-Chinese speech translation data, improved performance for translation to Chinese can be obtained for multiple languages, in addition to English. Furthermore, for languages related to those seen in training it is possible to perform speech translation, despite the model never seeing the language in training, or being able to perform transcription.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the moral alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences in multilingual trolley problems. Building on the Moral Machine experiment, which captures over 40 million human judgments across 200+ countries, we develop a cross-lingual corpus of moral dilemma vignettes in over 100 languages called $\mathrm{MultiTP}$. This dataset enables the assessment of LLMs' decision-making processes in diverse linguistic contexts. Our analysis explores the alignment of 19 different LLMs with human judgments, capturing preferences across six moral dimensions: species, gender, fitness, status, age, and the number of lives involved. By correlating these preferences with the demographic distribution of language speakers and examining the consistency of LLM responses to various prompt paraphrasings, our findings provide insights into cross-lingual and ethical biases of LLMs and their intersection. We discover significant variance in alignment across languages, challenging the assumption of uniform moral reasoning in AI systems and highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse perspectives in AI ethics. The results underscore the need for further research on the integration of multilingual dimensions in responsible AI research to ensure fair and equitable AI interactions worldwide.</description>

      <title>How Does Quantization Affect Multilingual LLMs?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantization techniques are widely used to improve inference speed and deployment of large language models. While a wide body of work examines the impact of quantization on LLMs in English, none have evaluated across languages. We conduct a thorough analysis of quantized multilingual LLMs, focusing on performance across languages and at varying scales. We use automatic benchmarks, LLM-as-a-Judge, and human evaluation, finding that (1) harmful effects of quantization are apparent in human evaluation, which automatic metrics severely underestimate: a 1.7% average drop in Japanese across automatic tasks corresponds to a 16.0% drop reported by human evaluators on realistic prompts; (2) languages are disparately affected by quantization, with non-Latin script languages impacted worst; and (3) challenging tasks like mathematical reasoning degrade fastest. As the ability to serve low-compute models is critical for wide global adoption of NLP technologies, our results urge consideration of multilingual performance as a key evaluation criterion for efficient models.</description>

      <title>LLM Roleplay: Simulating Human-Chatbot Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of chatbots requires collecting a large number of human-chatbot dialogues to reflect the breadth of users' sociodemographic backgrounds and conversational goals. However, the resource requirements to conduct the respective user studies can be prohibitively high and often only allow for a narrow analysis of specific dialogue goals and participant demographics. In this paper, we propose LLM Roleplay: a goal-oriented, persona-based method to automatically generate diverse multi-turn dialogues simulating human-chatbot interaction. LLM Roleplay can be applied to generate dialogues with any type of chatbot and uses large language models (LLMs) to play the role of textually described personas. To validate our method, we collect natural human-chatbot dialogues from different sociodemographic groups and conduct a user study to compare these with our generated dialogues. We evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in maintaining a conversation during their embodiment of a specific persona and find that our method can simulate human-chatbot dialogues with a high indistinguishability rate.</description>

      <title>Beyond Perplexity: Multi-dimensional Safety Evaluation of LLM Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasingly, model compression techniques enable large language models (LLMs) to be deployed in real-world applications. As a result of this momentum towards local deployment, compressed LLMs will interact with a large population. Prior work on compression typically prioritize preserving perplexity, which is directly analogous to training loss. The impact of compression method on other critical aspects of model behavior\, -- \,particularly safety\, -- \,requires systematic assessment. To this end, we investigate the impact of model compression along four dimensions: (1) degeneration harm, i.e., bias and toxicity in generation; (2) representational harm, i.e., biases in discriminative tasks; (3) dialect bias; and(4) language modeling and downstream task performance. We examine a wide spectrum of LLM compression techniques, including unstructured pruning, semi-structured pruning, and quantization. Our analysis reveals that compression can lead to unexpected consequences. Although compression may unintentionally alleviate LLMs' degeneration harm, it can still exacerbate representational harm. Furthermore, increasing compression produces a divergent impact on different protected groups. Finally, different compression methods have drastically different safety impacts: for example, quantization mostly preserves bias while pruning degrades quickly. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating safety assessments into the development of compressed LLMs to ensure their reliability across real-world applications.\footnote{Our implementation and results are available here: \url{https://github.com/zhichaoxu-shufe/Beyond-Perplexity-Compression-Safety-Eval}}</description>

      <title>EVA-Score: Evaluation of Long-form Summarization on Informativeness through Extraction and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since LLMs emerged, more attention has been paid to abstractive long-form summarization, where longer input sequences indicate more information contained. Nevertheless, the automatic evaluation of such summaries remains underexplored. The current evaluation metrics for long-form summarization either use similarity-based metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore or LLM-based metrics using appropriate prompts or pre-defined schema. We argue that the former only relies on similarity and fails to consider informativeness while the latter lacks quantitative analysis of informative richness, and is rather subjective and hard to explain. Current evaluation metrics either use traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore, which rely on surface-level similarity and fail to consider informativeness, or simple LLM-based metrics, which are not robust and easily overwhelmed by the long contexts. In this paper, we propose a new evaluation metric called EVA-Score to extract all information from the given summaries, identify overlapped information based on reference, and calculate the information score. We test EVA-Score on several datasets and the experimental results reveal that EVA-Score shows the highest correlation with humans. We also re-evaluate the performance of LLMs on long-form summarization from the information perspective. The results indicate that responses of LLMs still have a gap with the human-written answers. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of the effectiveness of EVA-Score, forecasting future ways to automatically evaluate abstractive long-form summarization.</description>

      <title>LLaMAX: Scaling Linguistic Horizons of LLM by Enhancing Translation Capabilities Beyond 100 Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable translation capabilities in high-resource language tasks, yet their performance in low-resource languages is hindered by insufficient multilingual data during pre-training. To address this, we conduct extensive multilingual continual pre-training on the LLaMA series models, enabling translation support across more than 100 languages. Through a comprehensive analysis of training strategies, such as vocabulary expansion and data augmentation, we develop LLaMAX. Remarkably, without sacrificing its generalization ability, LLaMAX achieves significantly higher translation performance compared to existing open-source LLMs (by more than 10 spBLEU points) and performs on-par with specialized translation model (M2M-100-12B) on the Flores-101 benchmark. Extensive experiments indicate that LLaMAX can serve as a robust multilingual foundation model.

      <title>Induction Heads as an Essential Mechanism for Pattern Matching in In-context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown a remarkable ability to learn and perform complex tasks through in-context learning (ICL). However, a comprehensive understanding of its internal mechanisms is still lacking. This paper explores the role of induction heads in a few-shot ICL setting. We analyse two state-of-the-art models, Llama-3-8B and InternLM2-20B on abstract pattern recognition and NLP tasks. Our results show that even a minimal ablation of induction heads leads to ICL performance decreases of up to ~32% for abstract pattern recognition tasks, bringing the performance close to random. For NLP tasks, this ablation substantially decreases the model's ability to benefit from examples, bringing few-shot ICL performance close to that of zero-shot prompts. We further use attention knockout to disable specific induction patterns, and present fine-grained evidence for the role that the induction mechanism plays in ICL.</description>

      <title>CompAct: Compressing Retrieved Documents Actively for Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation supports language models to strengthen their factual groundings by providing external contexts. However, language models often face challenges when given extensive information, diminishing their effectiveness in solving questions. Context compression tackles this issue by filtering out irrelevant information, but current methods still struggle in realistic scenarios where crucial information cannot be captured with a single-step approach. To overcome this limitation, we introduce CompAct, a novel framework that employs an active strategy to condense extensive documents without losing key information. Our experiments demonstrate that CompAct brings significant improvements in both performance and compression rate on multi-hop question-answering benchmarks. CompAct flexibly operates as a cost-efficient plug-in module with various off-the-shelf retrievers or readers, achieving exceptionally high compression rates (47x).</description>

      <title>mGTE: Generalized Long-Context Text Representation and Reranking Models for Multilingual Text Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present systematic efforts in building long-context multilingual text representation model (TRM) and reranker from scratch for text retrieval. We first introduce a text encoder (base size) enhanced with RoPE and unpadding, pre-trained in a native 8192-token context (longer than 512 of previous multilingual encoders). Then we construct a hybrid TRM and a cross-encoder reranker by contrastive learning. Evaluations show that our text encoder outperforms the same-sized previous state-of-the-art XLM-R. Meanwhile, our TRM and reranker match the performance of large-sized state-of-the-art BGE-M3 models and achieve better results on long-context retrieval benchmarks. Further analysis demonstrate that our proposed models exhibit higher efficiency during both training and inference. We believe their efficiency and effectiveness could benefit various researches and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>A Novel Metric for Measuring the Robustness of Large Language Models in Non-adversarial Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the robustness of several large language models on multiple datasets. Robustness here refers to the relative insensitivity of the model's answers to meaning-preserving variants of their input. Benchmark datasets are constructed by introducing naturally-occurring, non-malicious perturbations, or by generating semantically equivalent paraphrases of input questions or statements. We further propose a novel metric for assessing a model robustness, and demonstrate its benefits in the non-adversarial scenario by empirical evaluation of several models on the created datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structured generation, the process of producing content in standardized formats like JSON and XML, is widely utilized in real-world applications to extract key output information from large language models (LLMs). This study investigates whether such constraints on generation space impact LLMs abilities, including reasoning and domain knowledge comprehension. Specifically, we evaluate LLMs performance when restricted to adhere to structured formats versus generating free-form responses across various common tasks. Surprisingly, we observe a significant decline in LLMs reasoning abilities under format restrictions. Furthermore, we find that stricter format constraints generally lead to greater performance degradation in reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>A Logical Fallacy-Informed Framework for Argument Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language processing tasks, they still struggle with generating logically sound arguments, resulting in potential risks such as spreading misinformation. To address this issue, we introduce FIPO, a fallacy-informed framework that leverages preference optimization methods to steer LLMs toward logically sound arguments. FIPO includes a classification loss, to capture the fine-grained information on fallacy types. Our results on argumentation datasets show that our method reduces the fallacy errors by up to 17.5%. Furthermore, our human evaluation results indicate that the quality of the generated arguments by our method significantly outperforms the fine-tuned baselines, as well as other preference optimization methods, such as DPO. These findings highlight the importance of ensuring models are aware of logical fallacies for effective argument generation. Our code is available at github.com/lucamouchel/Logical-Fallacies.</description>

      <title>BA-LoRA: Bias-Alleviating Low-Rank Adaptation to Mitigate Catastrophic Inheritance in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, adapting LLMs to downstream applications requires computationally intensive and memory-demanding fine-tuning procedures. To alleviate these burdens, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques have emerged as a promising approach to tailor LLMs with minimal computational overhead. While PEFT methods offer substantial advantages, they do not fully address the pervasive issue of bias propagation from pre-training data. This work introduces Bias-Alleviating Low-Rank Adaptation (BA-LoRA), a novel PEFT method designed to counteract bias inheritance. BA-LoRA incorporates three distinct regularization terms: (1) a consistency regularizer, (2) a diversity regularizer, and (3) a singular value decomposition regularizer. These regularizers aim to enhance the models' consistency, diversity, and generalization capabilities during fine-tuning. We conduct extensive experiments on natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) tasks using prominent LLMs such as LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma. The results demonstrate that BA-LoRA outperforms LoRA and its state-of-the-art variants. Moreover, our method effectively mitigates the adverse effects of pre-training bias, leading to more reliable and robust model outputs.

      <title>Summarizing long regulatory documents with a multi-step pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to their length and complexity, long regulatory texts are challenging to summarize. To address this, a multi-step extractive-abstractive architecture is proposed to handle lengthy regulatory documents more effectively. In this paper, we show that the effectiveness of a two-step architecture for summarizing long regulatory texts varies significantly depending on the model used. Specifically, the two-step architecture improves the performance of decoder-only models. For abstractive encoder-decoder models with short context lengths, the effectiveness of an extractive step varies, whereas for long-context encoder-decoder models, the extractive step worsens their performance. This research also highlights the challenges of evaluating generated texts, as evidenced by the differing results from human and automated evaluations. Most notably, human evaluations favoured language models pretrained on legal text, while automated metrics rank general-purpose language models higher. The results underscore the importance of selecting the appropriate summarization strategy based on model architecture and context length.</description>

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering remains challenging for language models, given the deep technical knowledge required to answer questions correctly. This difficulty is amplified for smaller language models that cannot encode as much information in their parameters as larger models. The "Specializing Large Language Models for Telecom Networks" challenge aimed to enhance the performance of two small language models, Phi-2 and Falcon-7B in telecommunication question answering. In this paper, we present our question answering systems for this challenge. Our solutions achieved leading marks of 81.9% accuracy for Phi-2 and 57.3% for Falcon-7B. We have publicly released our code and fine-tuned models.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Activation Sparsity in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Activation sparsity can enable practical inference speedups in large language models (LLMs) by reducing the compute and memory-movement required for matrix multiplications during the forward pass. However, existing methods face limitations that inhibit widespread adoption. Some approaches are tailored towards older models with ReLU-based sparsity, while others require extensive continued pre-training on up to hundreds of billions of tokens. This paper describes TEAL, a simple training-free method that applies magnitude-based activation sparsity to hidden states throughout the entire model. TEAL achieves 40-50% model-wide sparsity with minimal performance degradation across Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral families, with sizes varying from 7B to 70B. We improve existing sparse kernels and demonstrate wall-clock decoding speed-ups of up to 1.53$\times$ and 1.8$\times$ at 40% and 50% model-wide sparsity. TEAL is compatible with weight quantization, enabling further efficiency gains.</description>

      <title>Polyrating: A Cost-Effective and Bias-Aware Rating System for LLM Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rating-based human evaluation has become an essential tool to accurately evaluate the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs). However, current rating systems suffer from several important limitations: first, they fail to account for biases that significantly influence evaluation results, second, they require large and expensive preference datasets to obtain accurate ratings, and third, they do not facilitate meaningful comparisons of model ratings across different tasks. To address these issues, we introduce Polyrating, an expressive and flexible rating system based on maximum a posteriori estimation that enables a more nuanced and thorough analysis of model performance at lower costs. Polyrating can detect and quantify biases affecting human preferences, ensuring fairer model comparisons. Further, Polyrating can reduce the cost of human evaluations by up to $41\%$ for new models and up to $77\%$ for new tasks by leveraging existing benchmark scores. Lastly, Polyrating enables direct comparisons of ratings across different tasks, providing a comprehensive understanding of an LLMs' strengths, weaknesses, and relative performance across different applications.</description>

      <title>On the Relationship between Truth and Political Bias in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language model alignment research often attempts to ensure that models are not only helpful and harmless, but also truthful and unbiased. However, optimizing these objectives simultaneously can obscure how improving one aspect might impact the others. In this work, we focus on analyzing the relationship between two concepts essential in both language model alignment and political science: truthfulness and political bias. We train reward models on various popular truthfulness datasets and subsequently evaluate their political bias. Our findings reveal that optimizing reward models for truthfulness on these datasets tends to result in a left-leaning political bias. We also find that existing open-source reward models (i.e., those trained on standard human preference datasets) already show a similar bias and that the bias is larger for larger models. These results raise important questions about the datasets used to represent truthfulness, potential limitations of aligning models to be both truthful and politically unbiased, and what language models capture about the relationship between truth and politics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of classic information-theoretic measures of predictive uncertainty in online language processing, based on the simulation of expected continuations of incremental linguistic contexts. Our framework provides a formal definition of anticipatory and responsive measures, and it equips experimenters with the tools to define new, more expressive measures beyond standard next-symbol entropy and surprisal. While extracting these standard quantities from language models is convenient, we demonstrate that using Monte Carlo simulation to estimate alternative responsive and anticipatory measures pays off empirically: New special cases of our generalized formula exhibit enhanced predictive power compared to surprisal for human cloze completion probability as well as ELAN, LAN, and N400 amplitudes, and greater complementarity with surprisal in predicting reading times.</description>

      <title>SAGED: A Holistic Bias-Benchmarking Pipeline for Language Models with Customisable Fairness Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of unbiased large language models is widely recognized as crucial, yet existing benchmarks fall short in detecting biases due to limited scope, contamination, and lack of a fairness baseline. SAGED(-Bias) is the first holistic benchmarking pipeline to address these problems. The pipeline encompasses five core stages: scraping materials, assembling benchmarks, generating responses, extracting numeric features, and diagnosing with disparity metrics. SAGED includes metrics for max disparity, such as impact ratio, and bias concentration, such as Max Z-scores. Noticing that assessment tool bias and contextual bias in prompts can distort evaluation, SAGED implements counterfactual branching and baseline calibration for mitigation. For demonstration, we use SAGED on G20 Countries with popular 8b-level models including Gemma2, Llama3.1, Mistral, and Qwen2. With sentiment analysis, we find that while Mistral and Qwen2 show lower max disparity and higher bias concentration than Gemma2 and Llama3.1, all models are notably biased against countries like Russia and (except for Qwen2) China. With further experiments to have models role-playing U.S. (vice-/former-) presidents, we see bias amplifies and shifts in heterogeneous directions. Moreover, we see Qwen2 and Mistral not engage in role-playing, while Llama3.1 and Gemma2 role-play Trump notably more intensively than Biden and Harris, indicating role-playing performance bias in these models.</description>

      <title>Instruct-Tuning Pretrained Causal Language Models for Ancient Greek Papyrology and Epigraphy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes an experiment in fine-tuning a pretrained causal language model (Meta's Llama 3.1 8B Instruct) to support three key tasks in philological research: dating, geographic attribution, and restoring missing or illegible characters in ancient Greek inscriptions and documentary papyri.
  Using an instruction-based approach and a 95%/5% train/test split, the models for papyri achieved a character error rate (CER) of 14.9%, a top-1 accuracy of 73.5%, and a top-20 accuracy of 86.0% in text reconstruction on the test set. For geographic attribution, they achieved a top-1 accuracy of 66.4% and a top-3 accuracy of 79.9%. In chronological attribution, the models showed an average deviation of 21.7 years from the actual terminus post/ante quem, with a median deviation of 0 years.
  For inscriptions, the models achieved a CER of 20.5%, a top-1 accuracy of 63.7%, and a top-20 accuracy of 83.0% for sequences up to 10 characters. In geographic attribution, they reached a top-1 accuracy of 75.0% and a top-3 accuracy of 83.7%. For dating, they had an average deviation of 37.1 years and a median deviation of 3 years from the actual date. When benchmarked against the state-of-the-art model (Ithaca) on a shared test set and recently edited inscriptions, the instruction-tuned models excelled in text restoration, with the added benefit of ignoring spaces during reconstruction to align with the continuous script of ancient texts. However, the models performed lower than Ithaca in geographic and chronological attribution.
  These preliminary results suggest that fine-tuning larger pretrained causal language models with instruction templates holds promise for philological research, especially in textual criticism.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the challenges posed by nominal adjectives (NAs) in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, particularly in part-of-speech (POS) tagging. We propose treating NAs as a distinct POS tag, "JN," and investigate its impact on POS tagging, BIO chunking, and coreference resolution. Our study shows that reclassifying NAs can improve the accuracy of syntactic analysis and structural understanding in NLP. We present experimental results using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models, and Spacy, demonstrating the feasibility and potential benefits of this approach. Additionally we finetuned a bert model to identify the NA in untagged text.</description>

      <title>Can pre-trained language models generate titles for research papers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The title of a research paper communicates in a succinct style the main theme and, sometimes, the findings of the paper. Coming up with the right title is often an arduous task, and therefore, it would be beneficial to authors if title generation can be automated. In this paper, we fine-tune pre-trained language models to generate titles of papers from their abstracts. Additionally, we use GPT-3.5-turbo in a zero-shot setting to generate paper titles. The performance of the models is measured with ROUGE, METEOR, MoverScore, BERTScore and SciBERTScore metrics. We find that fine-tuned PEGASUS-large outperforms the other models, including fine-tuned LLaMA-3-8B and GPT-3.5-turbo, across most metrics. We also demonstrate that ChatGPT can generate creative titles for papers. Our observations suggest that AI-generated paper titles are generally accurate and appropriate.</description>

      <title>Cross-Lingual and Cross-Cultural Variation in Image Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Do speakers of different languages talk differently about what they see? Behavioural and cognitive studies report cultural effects on perception; however, these are mostly limited in scope and hard to replicate. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of cross-lingual variation in image descriptions. Using a multimodal dataset with 31 languages and images from diverse locations, we develop a method to accurately identify entities mentioned in captions and present in the images, then measure how they vary across languages. Our analysis reveals that pairs of languages that are geographically or genetically closer tend to mention the same entities more frequently. We also identify entity categories whose saliency is universally high (such as animate beings), low (clothing accessories) or displaying high variance across languages (landscape). In a case study, we measure the differences in a specific language pair (e.g., Japanese mentions clothing far more frequently than English). Furthermore, our method corroborates previous small-scale studies, including 1) Rosch et al. (1976)'s theory of basic-level categories, demonstrating a preference for entities that are neither too generic nor too specific, and 2) Miyamoto et al. (2006)'s hypothesis that environments afford patterns of perception, such as entity counts. Overall, our work reveals the presence of both universal and culture-specific patterns in entity mentions.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Multilingual Long-Context Models for Retrieval and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in handling long contexts, some exhibiting near-perfect recall on synthetic retrieval tasks. However, these evaluations have mainly focused on English text and involved a single target sentence within lengthy contexts. Our work investigates how LLM performance generalizes to multilingual settings with multiple hidden target sentences. We create a new dataset -- mLongRR -- to comprehensively evaluate several multilingual long-context LLMs on retrieval and reasoning tasks across five languages: English, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Swahili, and Somali. These languages share the Latin script but belong to distinct language families and resource levels. Our analysis reveals a significant performance gap between languages. The best-performing models such as Gemini-1.5 and GPT-4o, achieve around 96% accuracy in English to around 36% in Somali with a single target sentence. However, this accuracy drops to 40% in English and 0% in Somali when dealing with three target sentences. Our findings highlight the challenges long-context LLMs face when processing longer contexts, an increase in the number of target sentences, or languages of lower resource levels.</description>

      <title>Towards Automated Patent Workflows: AI-Orchestrated Multi-Agent Framework for Intellectual Property Management and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Patents are the currency of innovation, and like any currency, they need to be managed and protected (Gavin Potenza). Patents, as legal documents that secure intellectual property rights, play a critical role in technological innovation. The growing complexity of patent documents and the surge in patent applications have created a need for automated solutions in patent analysis. In this work, we present PatExpert, an autonomous multi-agent conversational framework designed to streamline and optimize patent-related tasks. The framework consists of a metaagent that coordinates task-specific expert agents for various patent-related tasks and a critique agent for error handling and feedback provision. The meta-agent orchestrates specialized expert agents, each fine-tuned for specific tasks such as patent classification, acceptance, claim generation, abstractive summarization, multi-patent analysis, and scientific hypothesis generation. For multi-patent analysis, the framework incorporates advanced methods like Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG) to enhance response accuracy and relevance by combining semantic similarity with knowledge graphs. Error handling is managed by critique agents (Gold-LLM-as-a-Judge and Reward-LLM-as-a-Judge), which evaluate output responses for accuracy and provide iterative feedback. The framework also prioritizes explainability, ensuring transparent justifications for decisions made during patent analysis. Its comprehensive capabilities make it a valuable tool for automating complex patent workflows, enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and compliance in patent-related tasks. Empirical evidence demonstrates significant improvements in patent processing tasks, concluding that the framework offers a robust solution for automating and optimizing patent analysis.</description>

      <title>Improving Academic Skills Assessment with NLP and Ensemble Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenges of assessing foundational academic skills by leveraging advancements in natural language processing (NLP). Traditional assessment methods often struggle to provide timely and comprehensive feedback on key cognitive and linguistic aspects, such as coherence, syntax, and analytical reasoning. Our approach integrates multiple state-of-the-art NLP models, including BERT, RoBERTa, BART, DeBERTa, and T5, within an ensemble learning framework. These models are combined through stacking techniques using LightGBM and Ridge regression to enhance predictive accuracy. The methodology involves detailed data preprocessing, feature extraction, and pseudo-label learning to optimize model performance. By incorporating sophisticated NLP techniques and ensemble learning, this study significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of assessments, offering a robust solution that surpasses traditional methods and opens new avenues for educational technology research focused on enhancing core academic competencies.</description>

      <title>HealthQ: Unveiling Questioning Capabilities of LLM Chains in Healthcare Conversations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In digital healthcare, large language models (LLMs) have primarily been utilized to enhance question-answering capabilities and improve patient interactions. However, effective patient care necessitates LLM chains that can actively gather information by posing relevant questions. This paper presents HealthQ, a novel framework designed to evaluate the questioning capabilities of LLM healthcare chains. We implemented several LLM chains, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Chain of Thought (CoT), and reflective chains, and introduced an LLM judge to assess the relevance and informativeness of the generated questions. To validate HealthQ, we employed traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) metrics such as Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) and Named Entity Recognition (NER)-based set comparison, and constructed two custom datasets from public medical note datasets, ChatDoctor and MTS-Dialog. Our contributions are threefold: we provide the first comprehensive study on the questioning capabilities of LLMs in healthcare conversations, develop a novel dataset generation pipeline, and propose a detailed evaluation methodology.</description>

      <title>LexEval: A Comprehensive Chinese Legal Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in natural language processing tasks and demonstrate considerable potential in the legal domain. However, legal applications demand high standards of accuracy, reliability, and fairness. Applying existing LLMs to legal systems without careful evaluation of their potential and limitations could pose significant risks in legal practice. To this end, we introduce a standardized comprehensive Chinese legal benchmark LexEval. This benchmark is notable in the following three aspects: (1) Ability Modeling: We propose a new taxonomy of legal cognitive abilities to organize different tasks. (2) Scale: To our knowledge, LexEval is currently the largest Chinese legal evaluation dataset, comprising 23 tasks and 14,150 questions. (3) Data: we utilize formatted existing datasets, exam datasets and newly annotated datasets by legal experts to comprehensively evaluate the various capabilities of LLMs. LexEval not only focuses on the ability of LLMs to apply fundamental legal knowledge but also dedicates efforts to examining the ethical issues involved in their application. We evaluated 38 open-source and commercial LLMs and obtained some interesting findings. The experiments and findings offer valuable insights into the challenges and potential solutions for developing Chinese legal systems and LLM evaluation pipelines. The LexEval dataset and leaderboard are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/CSHaitao/LexEval} and will be continuously updated.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Singlish Discourse Particles with Task-Driven Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singlish, or formally Colloquial Singapore English, is an English-based creole language originating from the SouthEast Asian country Singapore. The language contains influences from Sinitic languages such as Chinese dialects, Malay, Tamil and so forth. A fundamental task to understanding Singlish is to first understand the pragmatic functions of its discourse particles, upon which Singlish relies heavily to convey meaning. This work offers a preliminary effort to disentangle the Singlish discourse particles (lah, meh and hor) with task-driven representation learning. After disentanglement, we cluster these discourse particles to differentiate their pragmatic functions, and perform Singlish-to-English machine translation. Our work provides a computational method to understanding Singlish discourse particles, and opens avenues towards a deeper comprehension of the language and its usage.</description>

      <title>Semantic Parsing with Candidate Expressions for Knowledge Base Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic parsers convert natural language to logical forms, which can be evaluated on knowledge bases (KBs) to produce denotations. Recent semantic parsers have been developed with sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) pre-trained language models (PLMs) or large language models, where the models treat logical forms as sequences of tokens. For syntactic and semantic validity, the semantic parsers use grammars that enable constrained decoding. However, the grammars lack the ability to utilize large information of KBs, although logical forms contain representations of KB elements, such as entities or relations. In this work, we propose a grammar augmented with candidate expressions for semantic parsing on a large KB with a seq2seq PLM. The grammar defines actions as production rules, and our semantic parser predicts actions during inference under the constraints by types and candidate expressions. We apply the grammar to knowledge base question answering, where the constraints by candidate expressions assist a semantic parser to generate valid KB elements. In experiments on two benchmarks, KQA Pro and Overnight, the constraints by candidate expressions increased the accuracy of our semantic parser, whether it was trained with strong supervision or weak supervision. Our semantic parser achieved state-of-the-art accuracies on KQA Pro and Overnight, and its implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/daehwannam/candexpr-sp.git.</description>

      <title>FlipGuard: Defending Preference Alignment against Update Regression with Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in preference alignment have significantly improved Large Language Models' ability to generate texts that align with human preferences and values. However, current alignment metrics typically emphasize the post-hoc overall improvement, while overlooking a critical aspect: regression, which refers to the backsliding on previously correctly-handled data after updates. This potential pitfall may arise from excessive fine-tuning on already well-aligned data, which subsequently leads to over-alignment and degeneration. To address this challenge, we propose FlipGuard, a constrained optimization approach to detect and mitigate update regression with focal attention. Specifically, FlipGuard identifies performance degradation using a customized reward characterization and strategically enforces a constraint to encourage conditional congruence with the pre-aligned model during training. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FlipGuard effectively alleviates update regression while demonstrating excellent overall performance, with the added benefit of knowledge preservation while aligning preferences.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents new methods that have the potential to improve privacy process efficiency with LLM and RAG. To reduce hallucination, we continually pre-train the base LLM model with a privacy-specific knowledge base and then augment it with a semantic RAG layer. Our evaluations demonstrate that this approach enhances the model performance (as much as doubled metrics compared to out-of-box LLM) in handling privacy-related queries, by grounding responses with factual information which reduces inaccuracies.</description>

      <title>Five Years of COVID-19 Discourse on Instagram: A Labeled Instagram Dataset of Over Half a Million Posts for Multilingual Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The work presented in this paper makes three scientific contributions with a specific focus on mining and analysis of COVID-19-related posts on Instagram. First, it presents a multilingual dataset of 500,153 Instagram posts about COVID-19 published between January 2020 and September 2024. This dataset, available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/d46p-v480, contains Instagram posts in 161 different languages as well as 535,021 distinct hashtags. After the development of this dataset, multilingual sentiment analysis was performed, which involved classifying each post as positive, negative, or neutral. The results of sentiment analysis are presented as a separate attribute in this dataset. Second, it presents the results of performing sentiment analysis per year from 2020 to 2024. The findings revealed the trends in sentiment related to COVID-19 on Instagram since the beginning of the pandemic. For instance, between 2020 and 2024, the sentiment trends show a notable shift, with positive sentiment decreasing from 38.35% to 28.69%, while neutral sentiment rising from 44.19% to 58.34%. Finally, the paper also presents findings of language-specific sentiment analysis. This analysis highlighted similar and contrasting trends of sentiment across posts published in different languages on Instagram. For instance, out of all English posts, 49.68% were positive, 14.84% were negative, and 35.48% were neutral. In contrast, among Hindi posts, 4.40% were positive, 57.04% were negative, and 38.56% were neutral, reflecting distinct differences in the sentiment distribution between these two languages.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Human Preference Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models demonstrate impressive reasoning abilities but struggle to provide personalized content due to their lack of individual user preference information. Existing methods, such as in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, fall short in capturing the complexity of human preferences, especially given the small, personal datasets individuals possess. In this paper, we propose a novel approach utilizing small parameter models as preference agents to generate natural language rules that guide a larger, pre-trained model, enabling efficient personalization. Our method involves a small, local "steering wheel" model that directs the outputs of a much larger foundation model, producing content tailored to an individual's preferences while leveraging the extensive knowledge and capabilities of the large model. Importantly, this personalization is achieved without the need to fine-tune the large model. Experimental results on email and article datasets, demonstrate that our technique significantly outperforms baseline personalization methods. By allowing foundation models to adapt to individual preferences in a data and compute-efficient manner, our approach paves the way for highly personalized language model applications.</description>

      <title>Beyond Scalar Reward Model: Learning Generative Judge from Preference Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is a common practice for aligning large language models~(LLMs) with human value. Conventionally, preference data is learned and encoded into a scalar reward model that connects a value head with an LLM to produce a scalar score as preference or reward. However, scalar models lack interpretability and are known to be susceptible to biases in datasets. This paper investigates leveraging the generation capability of LLMs to address both limitations in one shot. Specifically, we prompt the pre-trained LLM to generate positive and negative judgments, both supported with rationales in natural language form. The self-generated contrastive judgment pairs are used to train the generative judge with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This proposal of training the generative Judge using self-generated Contrastive judgments (Con-J) ensures natural interpretability due to the generated rationales together with the judgments, as well as high robustness against bias without the need for an additional reward head. Experimental results show that the performance of Con-J is comparable to the scalar reward model trained on the same collection of preference data, and demonstrate its superior interpretability and robustness in encoding human preferences.</description>

      <title>Self-Powered LLM Modality Expansion for Large Speech-Text Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable performance across diverse tasks, indicating their potential for expansion into large speech-text models (LSMs) by integrating speech capabilities. Although unified speech-text pre-training and multimodal data instruction-tuning offer considerable benefits, these methods generally entail significant resource demands and tend to overfit specific tasks. This study aims to refine the use of speech datasets for LSM training by addressing the limitations of vanilla instruction tuning. We explore the instruction-following dynamics within LSMs, identifying a critical issue termed speech anchor bias-a tendency for LSMs to over-rely on speech inputs, mistakenly interpreting the entire speech modality as directives, thereby neglecting textual instructions. To counteract this bias, we introduce a self-powered LSM that leverages augmented automatic speech recognition data generated by the model itself for more effective instruction tuning. Our experiments across a range of speech-based tasks demonstrate that self-powered LSM mitigates speech anchor bias and improves the fusion of speech and text modalities in LSMs. Data, code and scripts are freely available at https://github.com/ytf-philp/Self-powered-LSM.</description>

      <title>PAD: Personalized Alignment at Decoding-Time</title>

Abstract: Aligning with personalized preferences, which vary significantly across cultural, educational, and political differences, poses a significant challenge due to the computational costs and data demands of traditional alignment methods. In response, this paper presents Personalized Alignment at Decoding-time (PAD), a novel framework designed to align LLM outputs with diverse personalized preferences during the inference phase, eliminating the need for additional training. By introducing a unique personalized reward modeling strategy, this framework decouples the text generation process from personalized preferences, facilitating the generation of generalizable token-level personalized rewards. The PAD algorithm leverages these rewards to guide the decoding process, dynamically tailoring the base model's predictions to personalized preferences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PAD not only outperforms existing training-based alignment methods in terms of aligning with diverse preferences but also shows significant generalizability to preferences unseen during training and scalability across different base models. This work advances the capability of LLMs to meet user needs in real-time applications, presenting a substantial step forward in personalized LLM alignment.</description>

      <title>Hyper-multi-step: The Truth Behind Difficult Long-context Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-context language models (LCLM), characterized by their extensive context window, is becoming increasingly popular. Meanwhile, many long-context benchmarks present challenging tasks that even the most advanced LCLMs struggle to complete. However, the underlying sources of various challenging long-context tasks have seldom been studied. To bridge this gap, we conduct experiments to indicate their difficulty stems primarily from two basic issues: "multi-matching retrieval," which requires the simultaneous retrieval of multiple items, and "logic-based retrieval," which necessitates logical judgment within retrieval criteria. These two problems, while seemingly straightforward, actually exceed the capabilities of LCLMs because they are proven to be hyper-multi-step (demanding numerous steps to solve) in nature. This finding could explain why LLMs struggle with more advanced long-context tasks, providing a more accurate perspective for rethinking solutions for them.</description>

      <title>$\textbf{Only-IF}$:Revealing the Decisive Effect of Instruction Diversity on Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and accurately following instructions is critical for large language models (LLMs) to be effective across diverse tasks. In this work, we rigorously examine the key factors that enable models to generalize to unseen instructions, providing insights to guide the collection of data for instruction-tuning. Through controlled experiments, inspired by the Turing-complete Markov algorithm, we demonstrate that such generalization $\textbf{only emerges}$ when training data is diversified enough across semantic domains. Our findings also reveal that merely diversifying within limited domains fails to ensure robust generalization. In contrast, cross-domain data diversification, even under constrained data budgets, significantly enhances a model's adaptability. We further extend our analysis to real-world scenarios, including fine-tuning of $\textit{$\textbf{specialist}$}$ and $\textit{$\textbf{generalist}$}$ models. In both cases, we demonstrate that 1) better performance can be achieved by increasing the diversity of an established dataset while keeping the data size constant, and 2) when scaling up the data, diversifying the semantics of instructions is more effective than simply increasing the quantity of similar data. Our research provides important insights for dataset collation, particularly when optimizing model performance by expanding training data for both specialist and generalist scenarios. We show that careful consideration of data diversification is key: training specialist models with data extending beyond their core domain leads to significant performance improvements, while generalist models benefit from diverse data mixtures that enhance their overall instruction-following capabilities across a wide range of applications. Our results highlight the critical role of strategic diversification and offer clear guidelines for improving data quality.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the Risk of Health Inequity Exacerbated by Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated their potential in numerous medical applications, particularly in automating clinical trial matching for translational research and enhancing medical question answering for clinical decision support. However, our study shows that incorporating non decisive sociodemographic factors such as race, sex, income level, LGBT+ status, homelessness, illiteracy, disability, and unemployment into the input of LLMs can lead to incorrect and harmful outputs for these populations. These discrepancies risk exacerbating existing health disparities if LLMs are widely adopted in healthcare. To address this issue, we introduce EquityGuard, a novel framework designed to detect and mitigate the risk of health inequities in LLM based medical applications. Our evaluation demonstrates its efficacy in promoting equitable outcomes across diverse populations.</description>

      <title>Auto-Evolve: Enhancing Large Language Model's Performance via Self-Reasoning Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in prompt engineering strategies, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Discover, have demonstrated significant potential in improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompting strategies rely on single or fixed set of static seed reasoning modules like "think step by step" or "break down this problem" intended to simulate human approach to problem-solving. This constraint limits the flexibility of models in tackling diverse problems effectively. In this paper, we introduce Auto-Evolve, a novel framework that enables LLMs to self-create dynamic reasoning modules and downstream action plan, resulting in significant improvements over current SOTA methods. We evaluate Auto-Evolve on the challenging BigBench-Hard (BBH) dataset with Claude 2.0, Claude 3 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and GPT 4, where it consistently outperforms the SOTA prompt strategies. Auto-Evolve outperforms CoT by up to 10.4% and on an average by 7% across these four models. Our framework introduces two innovations: a) Auto-Evolve dynamically generates reasoning modules for each task while aligning with human reasoning paradigm, thus eliminating the need for predefined templates. b) We introduce an iterative refinement component, that incrementally refines instruction guidance for LLMs and helps boost performance by average 2.8% compared to doing it in a single step.</description>

      <title>MOOSE-Chem: Large Language Models for Rediscovering Unseen Chemistry Scientific Hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific discovery contributes largely to human society's prosperity, and recent progress shows that LLMs could potentially catalyze this process. However, it is still unclear whether LLMs can discover novel and valid hypotheses in chemistry. In this work, we investigate this central research question: Can LLMs automatically discover novel and valid chemistry research hypotheses given only a chemistry research background (consisting of a research question and/or a background survey), without limitation on the domain of the research question? After extensive discussions with chemistry experts, we propose an assumption that a majority of chemistry hypotheses can be resulted from a research background and several inspirations. With this key insight, we break the central question into three smaller fundamental questions. In brief, they are: (1) given a background question, whether LLMs can retrieve good inspirations; (2) with background and inspirations, whether LLMs can lead to hypothesis; and (3) whether LLMs can identify good hypotheses to rank them higher. To investigate these questions, we construct a benchmark consisting of 51 chemistry papers published in Nature, Science, or a similar level in 2024 (all papers are only available online since 2024). Every paper is divided by chemistry PhD students into three components: background, inspirations, and hypothesis. The goal is to rediscover the hypothesis, given only the background and a large randomly selected chemistry literature corpus consisting the ground truth inspiration papers, with LLMs trained with data up to 2023. We also develop an LLM-based multi-agent framework that leverages the assumption, consisting of three stages reflecting the three smaller questions. The proposed method can rediscover many hypotheses with very high similarity with the ground truth ones, covering the main innovations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Collaborative Data Selection for Efficient LLM Pretraining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient data selection is crucial to accelerate the pretraining of large language models (LLMs). While various methods have been proposed to enhance data efficiency, limited research has addressed the inherent conflicts between these approaches to achieve optimal data selection for LLM pretraining. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel multi-agent collaborative data selection mechanism. In this framework, each data selection method serves as an independent agent, and an agent console is designed to dynamically integrate the information from all agents throughout the LLM training process. We conduct extensive empirical studies to evaluate our multi-agent framework. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves data efficiency, accelerates convergence in LLM training, and achieves an average performance gain up to 10.5% across multiple language model benchmarks compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>What Makes Large Language Models Reason in (Multi-Turn) Code Generation?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompting techniques such as chain-of-thought have established themselves as a popular vehicle for improving the outputs of large language models (LLMs). For code generation, however, their exact mechanics and efficacy are under-explored. We thus investigate the effects of a wide range of prompting strategies with a focus on automatic re-prompting over multiple turns and computational requirements. After systematically decomposing reasoning, instruction, and execution feedback prompts, we conduct an extensive grid search on the competitive programming benchmarks CodeContests and TACO for multiple LLM families and sizes (Llama 3.0 and 3.1, 8B, 70B, 405B, and GPT-4o). Our study reveals strategies that consistently improve performance across all models with small and large sampling budgets. We then show how finetuning with such an optimal configuration allows models to internalize the induced reasoning process and obtain improvements in performance and scalability for multi-turn code generation.</description>

      <title>Which Demographics do LLMs Default to During Annotation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Demographics and cultural background of annotators influence the labels they assign in text annotation -- for instance, an elderly woman might find it offensive to read a message addressed to a "bro", but a male teenager might find it appropriate. It is therefore important to acknowledge label variations to not under-represent members of a society. Two research directions developed out of this observation in the context of using large language models (LLM) for data annotations, namely (1) studying biases and inherent knowledge of LLMs and (2) injecting diversity in the output by manipulating the prompt with demographic information. We combine these two strands of research and ask the question to which demographics an LLM resorts to when no demographics is given. To answer this question, we evaluate which attributes of human annotators LLMs inherently mimic. Furthermore, we compare non-demographic conditioned prompts and placebo-conditioned prompts (e.g., "you are an annotator who lives in house number 5") to demographics-conditioned prompts ("You are a 45 year old man and an expert on politeness annotation. How do you rate {instance}"). We study these questions for politeness and offensiveness annotations on the POPQUORN data set, a corpus created in a controlled manner to investigate human label variations based on demographics which has not been used for LLM-based analyses so far. We observe notable influences related to gender, race, and age in demographic prompting, which contrasts with previous studies that found no such effects.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Indonesian Automatic Speech Recognition: Evaluating Multilingual Models with Diverse Speech Variabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ideal speech recognition model has the capability to transcribe speech accurately under various characteristics of speech signals, such as speaking style (read and spontaneous), speech context (formal and informal), and background noise conditions (clean and moderate). Building such a model requires a significant amount of training data with diverse speech characteristics. Currently, Indonesian data is dominated by read, formal, and clean speech, leading to a scarcity of Indonesian data with other speech variabilities. To develop Indonesian automatic speech recognition (ASR), we present our research on state-of-the-art speech recognition models, namely Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS) and Whisper, as well as compiling a dataset comprising Indonesian speech with variabilities to facilitate our study. We further investigate the models' predictive ability to transcribe Indonesian speech data across different variability groups. The best results were achieved by the Whisper fine-tuned model across datasets with various characteristics, as indicated by the decrease in word error rate (WER) and character error rate (CER). Moreover, we found that speaking style variability affected model performance the most.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating diverse responses from large language models (LLMs) is crucial for applications such as planning/search and synthetic data generation, where diversity provides distinct answers across generations. Prior approaches rely on increasing temperature to increase diversity. However, contrary to popular belief, we show not only does this approach produce lower quality individual generations as temperature increases, but it depends on model's next-token probabilities being similar to the true distribution of answers. We propose SimpleStrat, an alternative approach that uses the language model itself to partition the space into strata. At inference, a random stratum is selected and a sample drawn from within the strata. To measure diversity, we introduce CoverageQA, a dataset of underspecified questions with multiple equally plausible answers, and assess diversity by measuring KL Divergence between the output distribution and uniform distribution over valid ground truth answers. As computing probability per response/solution for proprietary models is infeasible, we measure recall on ground truth solutions. Our evaluation show using SimpleStrat achieves higher recall by 0.05 compared to GPT-4o and 0.36 average reduction in KL Divergence compared to Llama 3.</description>

Abstract: The capabilities of large language models have grown significantly in recent years and so too have concerns about their misuse. It is important to be able to distinguish machine-generated text from human-authored content. Prior works have proposed numerous schemes to watermark text, which would benefit from a systematic evaluation framework. This work focuses on LLM output watermarking techniques - as opposed to image or model watermarks - and proposes Mark My Words, a comprehensive benchmark for them under different natural language tasks. We focus on three main metrics: quality, size (i.e., the number of tokens needed to detect a watermark), and tamper resistance (i.e., the ability to detect a watermark after perturbing marked text). Current watermarking techniques are nearly practical enough for real-world use: Kirchenbauer et al. [33]'s scheme can watermark models like Llama 2 7B-chat or Mistral-7B-Instruct with no perceivable loss in quality on natural language tasks, the watermark can be detected with fewer than 100 tokens, and their scheme offers good tamper resistance to simple perturbations. However, they struggle to efficiently watermark code generations. We publicly release our benchmark (https://github.com/wagner-group/MarkMyWords).</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Placement and Parallelism Framework for Accelerating RLHF Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, ChatGPT or InstructGPT like large language models (LLM) has made a significant impact in the AI world. Many works have attempted to reproduce the complex InstructGPT's training pipeline, namely Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). However, the mainstream distributed RLHF training methods typically adopt a fixed model placement strategy, referred to as the Co-located strategy. This strategy treats all four interdependent models involved in RLHF as a single entity, distributing them across all devices and applying parallelism techniques designed for a single model, regardless of the workload heterogeneity inherent to each model. As a result, this strategy exacerbates the generation bottlenecks in the RLHF training and degrades the overall training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a flexible model placement framework that offers two general and agile model placement strategies. The Interleaving strategy helps reduce memory redundancy and communication costs of RLHF training by placing models without dependencies on exclusive devices with careful orchestration. On the other hand, the Disaggregated strategy improves the throughput of model training by separating the training and inference runtime of the RLHF pipeline with additional shadow models. Furthermore, our framework provides a simple user interface and guidelines to easily and flexibly configure these strategies in various training scenarios. Our experiments have shown that our strategy can achieve notable improvements up to 11x, compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The results highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of our methods in accelerating the training of distributed RLHF.</description>

      <title>Q&amp;A Prompts: Discovering Rich Visual Clues through Mining Question-Answer Prompts for VQA requiring Diverse World Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10712v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the breakthrough of multi-modal large language models, answering complex visual questions that demand advanced reasoning abilities and world knowledge has become a much more important testbed for developing AI models than ever. However, equipping AI models with robust cross-modality reasoning ability remains challenging since the cognition scheme of humans has not been understood systematically. In this paper, we believe that if we can collect visual clues in the given image as much as possible, we will recognize the image more accurately, understand the question better, recall relevant knowledge more easily, and finally reason out the answer. We discover these rich visual clues by mining question-answer pairs in images and sending them into multi-modal large language models as prompts. We call the proposed method Q&amp;A Prompts. Specifically, we first use the image-answer pairs and the corresponding questions in the training set as inputs and outputs to train a visual question generation model. Then, we use an image tagging model to identify various instances and send packaged image-tag pairs into the visual question generation model to generate relevant questions with the extracted image tags as answers. Finally, we encode these generated question-answer pairs as prompts with a visual-aware prompting module and send them into pre-trained multi-modal large language models to reason out the final answers. Experimental results show that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, our Q&amp;A Prompts achieves substantial improvements on the challenging visual question answering datasets requiring reasoning over diverse world knowledge, such as OK-VQA and A-OKVQA.</description>

      <title>Instruction Fine-Tuning: Does Prompt Loss Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13586v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel study analyzing the effects of various prompt loss token weights (PLW) for supervised instruction fine-tuning (SIFT). While prompt-masking (PLW = 0) is common for SIFT, some fine-tuning APIs support fractional PLWs and suggest that using a small non-zero PLW can help stabilize learning when fine-tuning on short-completion data. However, there has never been a study confirming this claim, and OpenAI, a major cloud-based SIFT provider, recently removed this parameter from their fine-tuning API. We found that performance of models fine-tuned on short-completion data had a statistically-significant negative quadratic relationship with PLW. Using small values (0.01 - 0.5) of PLW produced better results on multiple-choice and short-generation benchmarks (outperforming models fine-tuned on long-completion data) while large values (~ 1.0) of PLW produced better results on long-generation benchmarks. We explained this effect and verified its importance through additional experiments. This research serves as a warning to API providers about the importance of providing a PLW parameter for SIFT.</description>

      <title>Diff-eRank: A Novel Rank-Based Metric for Evaluating Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing and extended their powerful capabilities to multi-modal domains. As LLMs continue to advance, it is crucial to develop diverse and appropriate metrics for their evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a novel rank-based metric, Diff-eRank, grounded in information theory and geometry principles. Diff-eRank assesses LLMs by analyzing their hidden representations, providing a quantitative measure of how efficiently they eliminate redundant information during training. We demonstrate the applicability of Diff-eRank in both single-modal (e.g., language) and multi-modal settings. For language models, our results show that Diff-eRank increases with model size and correlates well with conventional metrics such as loss and accuracy. In the multi-modal context, we propose an alignment evaluation method based on the eRank, and verify that contemporary multi-modal LLMs exhibit strong alignment performance based on our method. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/waltonfuture/Diff-eRank.</description>

      <title>AutoTimes: Autoregressive Time Series Forecasters via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models of time series have not been fully developed due to the limited availability of time series corpora and the underexploration of scalable pre-training. Based on the similar sequential formulation of time series and natural language, increasing research demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLM) for time series. Nevertheless, the inherent autoregressive property and decoder-only architecture of LLMs have not been fully considered, resulting in insufficient utilization of LLM abilities. To fully revitalize the general-purpose token transition and multi-step generation capability of large language models, we propose AutoTimes to repurpose LLMs as autoregressive time series forecasters, which projects time series into the embedding space of language tokens and autoregressively generates future predictions with arbitrary lengths. Compatible with any decoder-only LLMs, the consequent forecaster exhibits the flexibility of the lookback length and scalability with larger LLMs. Further, we formulate time series as prompts, extending the context for prediction beyond the lookback window, termed in-context forecasting. By introducing LLM-embedded textual timestamps, AutoTimes can utilize chronological information to align multivariate time series. Empirically, AutoTimes achieves state-of-the-art with 0.1% trainable parameters and over $5\times$ training/inference speedup compared to advanced LLM-based forecasters. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/thuml/AutoTimes.</description>

      <title>Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) with emerging capabilities has spurred public curiosity to evaluate and compare different LLMs, leading many researchers to propose their own LLM benchmarks. Noticing preliminary inadequacies in those benchmarks, we embarked on a study to critically assess 23 state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, using our novel unified evaluation framework through the lenses of people, process, and technology, under the pillars of benchmark functionality and integrity. Our research uncovered significant limitations, including biases, difficulties in measuring genuine reasoning, adaptability, implementation inconsistencies, prompt engineering complexity, evaluator diversity, and the overlooking of cultural and ideological norms in one comprehensive assessment. Our discussions emphasized the urgent need for standardized methodologies, regulatory certainties, and ethical guidelines in light of Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements, including advocating for an evolution from static benchmarks to dynamic behavioral profiling to accurately capture LLMs' complex behaviors and potential risks. Our study highlighted the necessity for a paradigm shift in LLM evaluation methodologies, underlining the importance of collaborative efforts for the development of universally accepted benchmarks and the enhancement of AI systems' integration into society.</description>

      <title>BitDelta: Your Fine-Tune May Only Be Worth One Bit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained in two phases: pre-training on large internet-scale datasets, and fine-tuning for downstream tasks. Given the higher computational demand of pre-training, it's intuitive to assume that fine-tuning adds less new information to the model, and is thus more compressible. We explore this assumption by decomposing the weights of fine-tuned models into their pre-trained components and an additional delta. We introduce a simple method, BitDelta, which successfully quantizes this delta down to 1 bit without compromising performance. This interesting finding not only highlights the potential redundancy of information added during fine-tuning, but also has significant implications for the multi-tenant serving and multi-tenant storage of fine-tuned models. By enabling the use of a single high-precision base model accompanied by multiple 1-bit deltas, BitDelta dramatically reduces GPU memory requirements by more than 10x, which can also be translated to enhanced generation latency in multi-tenant settings. We validate BitDelta through experiments across Llama-2 and Mistral model families, and on models up to 70B parameters, showcasing minimal performance degradation over all tested settings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models have revolutionized code generation ability by converting natural language descriptions into executable code. However, generating complex code within real-world scenarios remains challenging due to intricate structures, subtle bugs, understanding of advanced data types, and lack of supplementary contents. To address these challenges, we introduce the CoCoST framework, which enhances complex code generation by online searching for more information with planned queries and correctness testing for code refinement. Moreover, CoCoST serializes the complex inputs and outputs to improve comprehension and generates test cases to ensure the adaptability for real-world applications. CoCoST is validated through rigorous experiments on the DS-1000 and ClassEval datasets. Experimental results show that CoCoST substantially improves the quality of complex code generation, highlighting its potential to enhance the practicality of LLMs in generating complex code.</description>

      <title>Sign Stitching: A Novel Approach to Sign Language Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sign Language Production (SLP) is a challenging task, given the limited resources available and the inherent diversity within sign data. As a result, previous works have suffered from the problem of regression to the mean, leading to under-articulated and incomprehensible signing. In this paper, we propose using dictionary examples to create expressive sign language sequences. However, simply concatenating the signs would create robotic and unnatural sequences. Therefore, we present a 7-step approach to effectively stitch the signs together. First, by normalising each sign into a canonical pose, cropping and stitching we create a continuous sequence. Then by applying filtering in the frequency domain and resampling each sign we create cohesive natural sequences, that mimic the prosody found in the original data. We leverage the SignGAN model to map the output to a photo-realistic signer and present a complete Text-to-Sign (T2S) SLP pipeline. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, showcasing state-of-the-art performance across all datasets.</description>

      <title>EffiLearner: Enhancing Efficiency of Generated Code via Self-Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in code generation, but their generated code often suffers from inefficiency, resulting in longer execution times and higher memory consumption. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{EffiLearner}, a self-optimization framework that utilizes execution overhead profiles to improve the efficiency of LLM-generated code. EffiLearner first generates code using an LLM, then executes it locally to capture execution time and memory usage profiles. These profiles are fed back to the LLM, which then revises the code to reduce overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness of EffiLearner, we conduct extensive experiments on the EffiBench, HumanEval, and MBPP with 16 open-source and 6 closed-source models. Our evaluation results demonstrate that through iterative self-optimization, EffiLearner significantly enhances the efficiency of LLM-generated code. For example, the execution time (ET) of StarCoder2-15B for the EffiBench decreases from 0.93 (s) to 0.12 (s) which reduces 87.1% the execution time requirement compared with the initial code. The total memory usage (TMU) of StarCoder2-15B also decreases from 22.02 (Mb*s) to 2.03 (Mb*s), which decreases 90.8% of total memory consumption during the execution process. The source code of EffiLearner was released in \url{https://github.com/huangd1999/EffiLearner}.</description>

      <title>Visual Description Grounding Reduces Hallucinations and Boosts Reasoning in LVLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often produce responses that misalign with factual information, a phenomenon known as hallucinations. While hallucinations are well-studied, the exact causes behind them remain underexplored. In this paper, we first investigate the root causes of hallucinations in LVLMs. Our findings reveal that existing mitigation techniques primarily reduce hallucinations for visual recognition prompts-those that require simple descriptions of visual elements-but fail for cognitive prompts that demand deliberate reasoning. We identify the core issue as a lack of true visual perception in LVLMs: although they can accurately recognize visual elements, they struggle to fully interpret these elements in the context of the input prompt and effectively link this recognition to their internal knowledge, which is critical for reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce Visual Description Grounded Decoding (VDGD), a simple, robust, and training-free method designed to enhance visual perception and improve reasoning capabilities in LVLMs. VDGD works by first generating a detailed description of the image and appending it as a prefix to the instruction. During response generation, tokens are sampled based on their KL divergence to the description, favoring candidates with lower divergence. Experimental results on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks and LVLMs demonstrate that VDGD consistently outperforms existing baselines 2% - 33%. Finally, we introduce VaLLu, a benchmark designed for comprehensive evaluation of the cognitive capabilities of LVLMs.</description>

      <title>Tensor Attention Training: Provably Efficient Learning of Higher-order Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor Attention, a multi-view attention that is able to capture high-order correlations among multiple modalities, can overcome the representational limitations of classical matrix attention. However, the $O(n^3)$ time complexity of tensor attention poses a significant obstacle to its utilization in transformers, where $n$ is the input sequence length. In this work, we prove that the backward gradient of tensor attention training can be computed in almost linear time $n^{1+o(1)}$, the same complexity as its forward computation under the bounded entries assumption. We provide a closed-form solution for the gradient and propose a fast computation method utilizing polynomial approximation methods and tensor algebraic techniques. Furthermore, we prove the necessity and tightness of our assumption through hardness analysis, showing that slightly weakening it renders the gradient problem unsolvable in truly subcubic time. Our theoretical results establish the feasibility of efficient higher-order transformer training and may facilitate practical applications of tensor attention architectures.</description>

      <title>OwLore: Outlier-weighed Layerwise Sampled Low-Rank Projection for Memory-Efficient LLM Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various natural language processing tasks. However, the substantial size of LLMs presents significant challenges in training or fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient approaches such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have gained popularity, they often compromise performance compared to full-rank fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose Outlier-weighed Layerwise Sampled Low-Rank Projection (OwLore), a new memory-efficient fine-tuning approach, inspired by the layerwise outlier distribution of LLMs. Unlike LoRA, which adds extra adapters to all layers, OwLore strategically assigns higher sampling probabilities to layers with more outliers, selectively sampling only a few layers and fine-tuning their pre-trained weights. To further increase the number of fine-tuned layers without a proportional rise in memory costs, we incorporate gradient low-rank projection, further boosting the approach's performance. Our extensive experiments across various architectures, including LLaMa2, LLaMa3, and Mistral, demonstrate that OwLore consistently outperforms baseline approaches, including full fine-tuning. Specifically, it achieves up to a 1.1% average accuracy gain on the Commonsense Reasoning benchmark, a 3.0% improvement on MMLU, and a notable 10% boost on MT-Bench, while being more memory efficient. OwLore allows us to fine-tune LLaMa2-7B with only 21GB of memory. Code is available at https://github.com/pixeli99/OwLore.</description>

      <title>From Artificial Needles to Real Haystacks: Improving Retrieval Capabilities in LLMs by Finetuning on Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to accurately retrieve information and maintain reasoning capabilities when processing long-context inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a finetuning approach utilizing a carefully designed synthetic dataset comprising numerical key-value retrieval tasks. Our experiments on models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and Mistral 7B demonstrate that finetuning LLMs on this dataset significantly improves LLMs' information retrieval and reasoning capabilities in longer-context settings. We present an analysis of the finetuned models, illustrating the transfer of skills from synthetic to real task evaluations (e.g., $10.5\%$ improvement on $20$ documents MDQA at position $10$ for GPT-3.5 Turbo). We also find that finetuned LLMs' performance on general benchmarks remains almost constant while LLMs finetuned on other baseline long-context augmentation data can encourage hallucination (e.g., on TriviaQA, Mistral 7B finetuned on our synthetic data cause no performance drop while other baseline data can cause a drop that ranges from $2.33\%$ to $6.19\%$). Our study highlights the potential of finetuning on synthetic data for improving the performance of LLMs on longer-context tasks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Automated Circuit Discovery in Transformers using Contextual Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated mechanistic interpretation research has attracted great interest due to its potential to scale explanations of neural network internals to large models. Existing automated circuit discovery work relies on activation patching or its approximations to identify subgraphs in models for specific tasks (circuits). They often suffer from slow runtime, approximation errors, and specific requirements of metrics, such as non-zero gradients. In this work, we introduce contextual decomposition for transformers (CD-T) to build interpretable circuits in large language models. CD-T can produce circuits of arbitrary level of abstraction, and is the first able to produce circuits as fine-grained as attention heads at specific sequence positions efficiently. CD-T consists of a set of mathematical equations to isolate contribution of model features. Through recursively computing contribution of all nodes in a computational graph of a model using CD-T followed by pruning, we are able to reduce circuit discovery runtime from hours to seconds compared to state-of-the-art baselines. On three standard circuit evaluation datasets (indirect object identification, greater-than comparisons, and docstring completion), we demonstrate that CD-T outperforms ACDC and EAP by better recovering the manual circuits with an average of 97% ROC AUC under low runtimes. In addition, we provide evidence that faithfulness of CD-T circuits is not due to random chance by showing our circuits are 80% more faithful than random circuits of up to 60% of the original model size. Finally, we show CD-T circuits are able to perfectly replicate original models' behavior (faithfulness $ = 1$) using fewer nodes than the baselines for all tasks. Our results underscore the great promise of CD-T for efficient automated mechanistic interpretability, paving the way for new insights into the workings of large language models.</description>

      <title>Tree Search for Language Model Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by language models (LMs) have demonstrated promise in their ability to perform decision-making tasks such as web automation. However, a key limitation remains: LMs, primarily optimized for natural language understanding and generation, struggle with multi-step reasoning, planning, and using environmental feedback when attempting to solve realistic computer tasks. Towards addressing this, we propose an inference-time search algorithm for LM agents to explicitly perform exploration and multi-step planning in interactive web environments. Our approach is a form of best-first tree search that operates within the actual environment space, and is complementary with most existing state-of-the-art agents. It is the first tree search algorithm for LM agents that shows effectiveness on realistic web tasks. On the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark, applying our search algorithm on top of a GPT-4o agent yields a 39.7% relative increase in success rate compared to the same baseline without search, setting a state-of-the-art success rate of 26.4%. On WebArena, search also yields a 28.0% relative improvement over a baseline agent, setting a competitive success rate of 19.2%. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of search for web agents, and we demonstrate that performance scales with increased test-time compute. We conduct a thorough analysis of our results to highlight improvements from search, limitations, and promising directions for future work. Our code and models are publicly released at https://jykoh.com/search-agents.</description>

      <title>Uplifting Lower-Income Data: Strategies for Socioeconomic Perspective Shifts in Large Multi-modal Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that the unequal representation of cultures and socioeconomic groups in training data leads to biased Large Multi-modal (LMM) models. To improve LMM model performance on underrepresented data, we propose and evaluate several prompting strategies using non-English, geographic, and socioeconomic attributes. We show that these geographic and socioeconomic integrated prompts favor retrieving topic appearances commonly found in data from low-income households across different countries leading to improved LMM model performance on lower-income data. Our analyses identify and highlight contexts where these strategies yield the most improvements.</description>

      <title>Learning Video Temporal Dynamics with Cross-Modal Attention for Robust Audio-Visual Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) aims to transcribe human speech using both audio and video modalities. In practical environments with noise-corrupted audio, the role of video information becomes crucial. However, prior works have primarily focused on enhancing audio features in AVSR, overlooking the importance of video features. In this study, we strengthen the video features by learning three temporal dynamics in video data: context order, playback direction, and the speed of video frames. Cross-modal attention modules are introduced to enrich video features with audio information so that speech variability can be taken into account when training on the video temporal dynamics. Based on our approach, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the LRS2 and LRS3 AVSR benchmarks for the noise-dominant settings. Our approach excels in scenarios especially for babble and speech noise, indicating the ability to distinguish the speech signal that should be recognized from lip movements in the video modality. We support the validity of our methodology by offering the ablation experiments for the temporal dynamics losses and the cross-modal attention architecture design.</description>

      <title>Transformer Block Coupling and its Correlation with Generalization in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing, and a precise understanding of the internal mechanisms driving their success is essential. In this work, we trace the trajectories of individual tokens as they pass through transformer blocks, and linearize the system along these trajectories through their Jacobian matrices. By examining the relationships between these Jacobians, we uncover a $\textbf{transformer block coupling}$ phenomenon in a variety of LLMs, characterized by the coupling of their top singular vectors across tokens and depth. Our findings reveal that coupling $\textit{positively correlates}$ with model performance, and that this relationship is stronger than with other hyperparameters, namely parameter budget, model depth, and embedding dimension. We further investigate the emergence of these properties through training, noting the development of coupling, as well as an increase in linearity and layer-wise exponential growth in the token trajectories. These collective insights provide a novel perspective on the interactions between token embeddings, and prompt further approaches to study training and generalization in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Vision Language Models for Cultural Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models and vision-language pre-training have notably advanced Vision Language Models (VLMs), enabling multimodal processing of visual and linguistic data. However, their performance has been typically assessed on general scene understanding - recognizing objects, attributes, and actions - rather than cultural comprehension. This study introduces CulturalVQA, a visual question-answering benchmark aimed at assessing VLM's geo-diverse cultural understanding. We curate a collection of 2,378 image-question pairs with 1-5 answers per question representing cultures from 11 countries across 5 continents. The questions probe understanding of various facets of culture such as clothing, food, drinks, rituals, and traditions. Benchmarking VLMs on CulturalVQA, including GPT-4V and Gemini, reveals disparity in their level of cultural understanding across regions, with strong cultural understanding capabilities for North America while significantly lower performance for Africa. We observe disparity in their performance across cultural facets too, with clothing, rituals, and traditions seeing higher performances than food and drink. These disparities help us identify areas where VLMs lack cultural understanding and demonstrate the potential of CulturalVQA as a comprehensive evaluation set for gauging VLM progress in understanding diverse cultures.</description>

      <title>AutoScale: Automatic Prediction of Compute-optimal Data Composition for Training LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain reweighting is an emerging research area aimed at adjusting the relative weights of different data sources to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of language model pre-training. This paper demonstrates that the optimal composition of training data from different domains is scale-dependent, challenging the existing practice of determining optimal mixtures through small-scale experiments and directly applying them at larger scales. We derive an analytical model for the dependence of optimal weights on data scale and introduce *AutoScale*, a novel, practical approach for optimizing data compositions at potentially large training data scales. *AutoScale* first uses a principled optimization framework to find optimal compositions at smaller, feasible scales, then predicts optimal compositions at larger scales using our derived model. Our evaluation on GPT-2 Large and BERT pre-training demonstrates *AutoScale*'s effectiveness in improving training convergence and downstream performance. Particularly, for GPT-2 Large on RedPajama, *AutoScale* decreases validation perplexity 28% faster than baselines, with up to 38% speed-up over unweighted training, achieving the best performance across downstream tasks. This work provides insights into the varying benefits of data sources across training scales for language models, contributing to the burgeoning research on scale-dependent data curation. Code is open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Faithful and Plausible Natural Language Explanations for Image Classification: A Pipeline Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing explanation methods for image classification struggle to provide faithful and plausible explanations. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a post-hoc natural language explanation method that can be applied to any CNN-based classifier without altering its training process or affecting predictive performance. By analysing influential neurons and the corresponding activation maps, the method generates a faithful description of the classifier's decision process in the form of a structured meaning representation, which is then converted into text by a language model. Through this pipeline approach, the generated explanations are grounded in the neural network architecture, providing accurate insight into the classification process while remaining accessible to non-experts. Experimental results show that the NLEs constructed by our method are significantly more plausible and faithful. In particular, user interventions in the neural network structure (masking of neurons) are three times more effective than the baselines.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust and Cost-Efficient Knowledge Unlearning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning and memorization capabilities via pretraining on massive textual corpora. However, this poses risk of privacy and copyright violations, highlighting the need for efficient machine unlearning methods that remove sensitive data without retraining from scratch. While Gradient Ascent (GA) is commonly used to unlearn by reducing the likelihood of generating unwanted content, it leads to unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting of retrained knowledge. We also find that combining GA with low-rank adaptation results in poor trade-offs between computational cost and generative performance. To address these challenges, we propose two novel techniques for robust and efficient unlearning for LLMs. First, we introduce Inverted Hinge loss, which suppresses unwanted tokens while maintaining fluency by boosting the probability of the next most likely token. Second, we develop a data-adaptive initialization for LoRA adapters via low-rank approximation weighted with relative Fisher information, thereby focusing updates on parameters critical for removing targeted knowledge. Experiments on the Training Data Extraction Challenge dataset using GPT-Neo models as well as on the TOFU benchmark with Phi-1.5B and Llama2-7B models demonstrate that our approach effectively removes sensitive information while maintaining reasoning and generative capabilities with minimal impact.</description>

      <title>Strategist: Learning Strategic Skills by LLMs via Bi-Level Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method STRATEGIST that utilizes LLMs to acquire new skills for playing multi-agent games through a self-improvement process. Our method gathers quality feedback through self-play simulations with Monte Carlo tree search and LLM-based reflection, which can then be used to learn high-level strategic skills such as how to evaluate states that guide the low-level execution. We showcase how our method can be used in both action planning and dialogue generation in the context of games, achieving good performance on both tasks. Specifically, we demonstrate that our method can help train agents with better performance than both traditional reinforcement learning-based approaches and other LLM-based skill learning approaches in games including the Game of Pure Strategy (GOPS) and The Resistance: Avalon. STRATEGIST helps bridge the gap between foundation models and symbolic decision-making methods through its bi-level approach, leading to more robust decision-making.</description>

      <title>LogicGame: Benchmarking Rule-Based Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15778v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable capabilities across various tasks, showcasing complex problem-solving abilities. Understanding and executing complex rules, along with multi-step planning, are fundamental to logical reasoning and critical for practical LLM agents and decision-making systems. However, evaluating LLMs as effective rule-based executors and planners remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LogicGame, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the comprehensive rule understanding, execution, and planning capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional benchmarks, LogicGame provides diverse games that contain a series of rules with an initial state, requiring models to comprehend and apply predefined regulations to solve problems. We create simulated scenarios in which models execute or plan operations to achieve specific outcomes. These game scenarios are specifically designed to distinguish logical reasoning from mere knowledge by relying exclusively on predefined rules. This separation allows for a pure assessment of rule-based reasoning capabilities. The evaluation considers not only final outcomes but also intermediate steps, providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance. Moreover, these intermediate steps are deterministic and can be automatically verified. LogicGame defines game scenarios with varying difficulty levels, from simple rule applications to complex reasoning chains, in order to offer a precise evaluation of model performance on rule understanding and multi-step execution. Utilizing LogicGame, we test various LLMs and identify notable shortcomings in their rule-based logical reasoning abilities.</description>

      <title>FC-KAN: Function Combinations in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce FC-KAN, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that leverages combinations of popular mathematical functions such as B-splines, wavelets, and radial basis functions on low-dimensional data through element-wise operations. We explore several methods for combining the outputs of these functions, including sum, element-wise product, the addition of sum and element-wise product, quadratic function representation, and concatenation. In our experiments, we compare FC-KAN with multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) and other existing KANs, such as BSRBF-KAN, EfficientKAN, FastKAN, and FasterKAN, on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. A variant of FC-KAN, which uses a combination of outputs from B-splines and Difference of Gaussians (DoG) in the form of a quadratic function, outperformed all other models on the average of 5 independent training runs. We expect that FC-KAN can leverage function combinations to design future KANs. Our repository is publicly available at: https://github.com/hoangthangta/FC_KAN.</description>

      <title>Weak-to-Strong Backdoor Attack for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite being widely applied due to their exceptional capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been proven to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. These attacks introduce targeted vulnerabilities into LLMs by poisoning training samples and full-parameter fine-tuning. However, this kind of backdoor attack is limited since they require significant computational resources, especially as the size of LLMs increases. Besides, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) offers an alternative but the restricted parameter updating may impede the alignment of triggers with target labels. In this study, we first verify that backdoor attacks with PEFT may encounter challenges in achieving feasible performance. To address these issues and improve the effectiveness of backdoor attacks with PEFT, we propose a novel backdoor attack algorithm from weak to strong based on feature alignment-enhanced knowledge distillation (W2SAttack). Specifically, we poison small-scale language models through full-parameter fine-tuning to serve as the teacher model. The teacher model then covertly transfers the backdoor to the large-scale student model through feature alignment-enhanced knowledge distillation, which employs PEFT. Theoretical analysis reveals that W2SAttack has the potential to augment the effectiveness of backdoor attacks. We demonstrate the superior performance of W2SAttack on classification tasks across four language models, four backdoor attack algorithms, and two different architectures of teacher models. Experimental results indicate success rates close to 100% for backdoor attacks targeting PEFT.</description>

      <title>PointAD: Comprehending 3D Anomalies from Points and Pixels for Zero-shot 3D Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot (ZS) 3D anomaly detection is a crucial yet unexplored field that addresses scenarios where target 3D training samples are unavailable due to practical concerns like privacy protection. This paper introduces PointAD, a novel approach that transfers the strong generalization capabilities of CLIP for recognizing 3D anomalies on unseen objects. PointAD provides a unified framework to comprehend 3D anomalies from both points and pixels. In this framework, PointAD renders 3D anomalies into multiple 2D renderings and projects them back into 3D space. To capture the generic anomaly semantics into PointAD, we propose hybrid representation learning that optimizes the learnable text prompts from 3D and 2D through auxiliary point clouds. The collaboration optimization between point and pixel representations jointly facilitates our model to grasp underlying 3D anomaly patterns, contributing to detecting and segmenting anomalies of unseen diverse 3D objects. Through the alignment of 3D and 2D space, our model can directly integrate RGB information, further enhancing the understanding of 3D anomalies in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments show the superiority of PointAD in ZS 3D anomaly detection across diverse unseen objects.</description>

      <title>Towards a Theoretical Understanding of Synthetic Data in LLM Post-Training: A Reverse-Bottleneck Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data has become a pivotal resource in post-training tasks for large language models (LLMs) due to the scarcity of high-quality, specific data. While various methods have been developed to generate synthetic data, there remains a discernible gap between the practical effects of synthetic data and our theoretical comprehension. To address this challenge, we commence by presenting a detailed modeling of the prevalent synthetic data generation process. Building upon this modeling, we demonstrate that the generalization capability of the post-trained model is critically determined by the information gain derived from the generative model, as analyzed from a novel reverse-bottleneck perspective. Moreover, we introduce the concept of Generalization Gain via Mutual Information (GGMI) and elucidate the relationship between generalization gain and information gain. This analysis serves as a theoretical foundation for synthetic data generation and further highlights its connection with the generalization capability of post-trained models, offering an understanding about the design of synthetic data generation techniques and the optimization of the post-training process. We open source our code at https://github.com/ZyGan1999/Towards-a-Theoretical-Understanding-of-Synthetic-Data-in-LLM-Post-Training.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Reliably Simulate Human Learner Actions? A Simulation Authoring Framework for Open-Ended Learning Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating learner actions helps stress-test open-ended interactive learning environments and prototype new adaptations before deployment. While recent studies show the promise of using large language models (LLMs) for simulating human behavior, such approaches have not gone beyond rudimentary proof-of-concept stages due to key limitations. First, LLMs are highly sensitive to minor prompt variations, raising doubts about their ability to generalize to new scenarios without extensive prompt engineering. Moreover, apparently successful outcomes can often be unreliable, either because domain experts unintentionally guide LLMs to produce expected results, leading to self-fulfilling prophecies; or because the LLM has encountered highly similar scenarios in its training data, meaning that models may not be simulating behavior so much as regurgitating memorized content. To address these challenges, we propose Hyp-Mix, a simulation authoring framework that allows experts to develop and evaluate simulations by combining testable hypotheses about learner behavior. Testing this framework in a physics learning environment, we found that GPT-4 Turbo maintains calibrated behavior even as the underlying learner model changes, providing the first evidence that LLMs can be used to simulate realistic behaviors in open-ended interactive learning environments, a necessary prerequisite for useful LLM behavioral simulation.</description>

      <title>DivScene: Benchmarking LVLMs for Object Navigation with Diverse Scenes and Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Object navigation in unknown environments is crucial for deploying embodied agents in real-world applications. While we have witnessed huge progress due to large-scale scene datasets, faster simulators, and stronger models, previous studies mainly focus on limited scene types and target objects. In this paper, we study a new task of navigating to diverse target objects in a large number of scene types. To benchmark the problem, we present a large-scale scene dataset, DivScene, which contains 4,614 scenes across 81 different types. With the dataset, we build an end-to-end embodied agent, NatVLM, by fine-tuning a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) through imitation learning. The LVLM is trained to take previous observations from the environment and generate the next actions. We also introduce CoT explanation traces of the action prediction for better performance when tuning LVLMs. Our extensive experiments find that we can build a performant LVLM-based agent through imitation learning on the shortest paths constructed by a BFS planner without any human supervision. Our agent achieves a success rate that surpasses GPT-4o by over 20%. Meanwhile, we carry out various analyses showing the generalization ability of our agent. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/zhaowei-wang-nlp/DivScene.</description>

      <title>Towards a Benchmark for Large Language Models for Business Process Management Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An increasing number of organizations are deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for a wide range of tasks. Despite their general utility, LLMs are prone to errors, ranging from inaccuracies to hallucinations. To objectively assess the capabilities of existing LLMs, performance benchmarks are conducted. However, these benchmarks often do not translate to more specific real-world tasks. This paper addresses the gap in benchmarking LLM performance in the Business Process Management (BPM) domain. Currently, no BPM-specific benchmarks exist, creating uncertainty about the suitability of different LLMs for BPM tasks. This paper systematically compares LLM performance on four BPM tasks focusing on small open-source models. The analysis aims to identify task-specific performance variations, compare the effectiveness of open-source versus commercial models, and assess the impact of model size on BPM task performance. This paper provides insights into the practical applications of LLMs in BPM, guiding organizations in selecting appropriate models for their specific needs.</description>

      <title>Information Discovery in e-Commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic commerce, or e-commerce, is the buying and selling of goods and services, or the transmitting of funds or data online. E-commerce platforms come in many kinds, with global players such as Amazon, Airbnb, Alibaba, eBay and platforms targeting specific geographic regions. Information retrieval has a natural role to play in e-commerce, especially in connecting people to goods and services. Information discovery in e-commerce concerns different types of search (e.g., exploratory search vs. lookup tasks), recommender systems, and natural language processing in e-commerce portals. The rise in popularity of e-commerce sites has made research on information discovery in e-commerce an increasingly active research area. This is witnessed by an increase in publications and dedicated workshops in this space. Methods for information discovery in e-commerce largely focus on improving the effectiveness of e-commerce search and recommender systems, on enriching and using knowledge graphs to support e-commerce, and on developing innovative question answering and bot-based solutions that help to connect people to goods and services. In this survey, an overview is given of the fundamental infrastructure, algorithms, and technical solutions for information discovery in e-commerce. The topics covered include user behavior and profiling, search, recommendation, and language technology in e-commerce.</description>

      <title>Packing Analysis: Packing Is More Appropriate for Large Models or Datasets in Supervised Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Packing, initially utilized in the pre-training phase, is an optimization technique designed to maximize hardware resource efficiency by combining different training sequences to fit the model's maximum input length. Although it has demonstrated effectiveness during pre-training, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis for the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage on the following points: (1) whether packing can effectively enhance training efficiency while maintaining performance, (2) the suitable size of the model and dataset for fine-tuning with the packing method, and (3) whether packing unrelated or related training samples might cause the model to either excessively disregard or over-rely on the context.
  In this paper, we perform extensive comparisons between SFT methods using padding and packing, covering SFT datasets ranging from 69K to 1.2M and models from 8B to 70B. This provides the first comprehensive analysis of the advantages and limitations of packing versus padding, as well as practical considerations for implementing packing in various training scenarios. Our analysis covers various benchmarks, including knowledge, reasoning, and coding, as well as GPT-based evaluations, time efficiency, and other fine-tuning parameters. We also open-source our code for fine-tuning and evaluation and provide checkpoints fine-tuned on datasets of different sizes, aiming to advance future research on packing methods.

      <title>Unintentional Unalignment: Likelihood Displacement in Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants are increasingly used for aligning language models with human preferences. Although these methods are designed to teach a model to generate preferred responses more frequently relative to dispreferred responses, prior work has observed that the likelihood of preferred responses often decreases during training. The current work sheds light on the causes and implications of this counter-intuitive phenomenon, which we term likelihood displacement. We demonstrate that likelihood displacement can be catastrophic, shifting probability mass from preferred responses to responses with an opposite meaning. As a simple example, training a model to prefer $\texttt{No}$ over $\texttt{Never}$ can sharply increase the probability of $\texttt{Yes}$. Moreover, when aligning the model to refuse unsafe prompts, we show that such displacement can unintentionally lead to unalignment, by shifting probability mass from preferred refusal responses to harmful responses (e.g., reducing the refusal rate of Llama-3-8B-Instruct from 74.4% to 33.4%). We theoretically characterize that likelihood displacement is driven by preferences that induce similar embeddings, as measured by a centered hidden embedding similarity (CHES) score. Empirically, the CHES score enables identifying which training samples contribute most to likelihood displacement in a given dataset. Filtering out these samples effectively mitigated unintentional unalignment in our experiments. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of curating data with sufficiently distinct preferences, for which we believe the CHES score may prove valuable.</description>

      <title>AgentHarm: A Benchmark for Measuring Harmfulness of LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The robustness of LLMs to jailbreak attacks, where users design prompts to circumvent safety measures and misuse model capabilities, has been studied primarily for LLMs acting as simple chatbots. Meanwhile, LLM agents -- which use external tools and can execute multi-stage tasks -- may pose a greater risk if misused, but their robustness remains underexplored. To facilitate research on LLM agent misuse, we propose a new benchmark called AgentHarm. The benchmark includes a diverse set of 110 explicitly malicious agent tasks (440 with augmentations), covering 11 harm categories including fraud, cybercrime, and harassment. In addition to measuring whether models refuse harmful agentic requests, scoring well on AgentHarm requires jailbroken agents to maintain their capabilities following an attack to complete a multi-step task. We evaluate a range of leading LLMs, and find (1) leading LLMs are surprisingly compliant with malicious agent requests without jailbreaking, (2) simple universal jailbreak templates can be adapted to effectively jailbreak agents, and (3) these jailbreaks enable coherent and malicious multi-step agent behavior and retain model capabilities. To enable simple and reliable evaluation of attacks and defenses for LLM-based agents, we publicly release AgentHarm at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ai-safety-institute/AgentHarm.</description>
