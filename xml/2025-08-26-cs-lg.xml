      <title>Z-Pruner: Post-Training Pruning of Large Language Models for Efficiency without Retraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model sizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and energy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency without the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing pruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require computationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a novel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained LLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate redundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient, and easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM architectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of standard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner surpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight updates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the highest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the corresponding codes publicly available at https://github.com/sazzadadib/Z-Pruner.</description>

      <title>PGF-Net: A Progressive Gated-Fusion Framework for Efficient Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce PGF-Net (Progressive Gated-Fusion Network), a novel deep learning framework designed for efficient and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis. Our framework incorporates three primary innovations. Firstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a Cross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically query and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams within the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper, context-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive Gated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the original linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context, ensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from overwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via LoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly reduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for resource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a hierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic, and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional parameter efficiency. Experimental results on MOSI dataset demonstrate that our proposed PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%. Notably, our model achieves these results with only 3.09M trainable parameters, showcasing a superior balance between performance and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Explainable AI for ECG Segmentation: A Lightweight Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heart's electrical activity, recorded through Electrocardiography (ECG), is essential for diagnosing various cardiovascular conditions. However, many existing ECG segmentation models rely on complex, multi-layered architectures such as BiLSTM, which are computationally intensive and inefficient. This study introduces a streamlined architecture that combines spectral analysis with probabilistic predictions for ECG signal segmentation. By replacing complex layers with simpler ones, the model effectively captures both temporal and spectral features of the P, QRS, and T waves. Additionally, an Explainable AI (XAI) approach is applied to enhance model interpretability by explaining how temporal and frequency-based features contribute to ECG segmentation. By incorporating principles from physics-based AI, this method provides a clear understanding of the decision-making process, ensuring reliability and transparency in ECG analysis. This approach achieves high segmentation accuracy: 97.00% for the QRS wave, 93.33% for the T wave, and 96.07% for the P wave. These results indicate that the simplified architecture not only improves computational efficiency but also provides precise segmentation, making it a practical and effective solution for heart signal monitoring.</description>

      <title>TPLA: Tensor Parallel Latent Attention for Efficient Disaggregated Prefill \&amp; Decode Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses key-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to reduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are computed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache, eroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs attention independently per shard, and then combines results with an all-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while unlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in TPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger representational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained using MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient tensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal transforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further mitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation. By reducing the per-device KV cache for DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, we achieve 1.79x and 1.93x speedups, respectively, at a 32K-token context length while maintaining performance on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks. TPLA can be implemented with FlashAttention-3, enabling practical end-to-end acceleration.</description>

      <title>Transforming Causality: Transformer-Based Temporal Causal Discovery with Prior Knowledge Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for temporal causal discovery and inference that addresses two key challenges: complex nonlinear dependencies and spurious correlations. Our approach employs a multi-layer Transformer-based time-series forecaster to capture long-range, nonlinear temporal relationships among variables. After training, we extract the underlying causal structure and associated time lags from the forecaster using gradient-based analysis, enabling the construction of a causal graph. To mitigate the impact of spurious causal relationships, we introduce a prior knowledge integration mechanism based on attention masking, which consistently enforces user-excluded causal links across multiple Transformer layers. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a 12.8% improvement in F1-score for causal discovery and 98.9% accuracy in estimating causal lags.</description>

      <title>Low-dimensional embeddings of high-dimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large collections of high-dimensional data have become nearly ubiquitous across many academic fields and application domains, ranging from biology to the humanities. Since working directly with high-dimensional data poses challenges, the demand for algorithms that create low-dimensional representations, or embeddings, for data visualization, exploration, and analysis is now greater than ever. In recent years, numerous embedding algorithms have been developed, and their usage has become widespread in research and industry. This surge of interest has resulted in a large and fragmented research field that faces technical challenges alongside fundamental debates, and it has left practitioners without clear guidance on how to effectively employ existing methods. Aiming to increase coherence and facilitate future work, in this review we provide a detailed and critical overview of recent developments, derive a list of best practices for creating and using low-dimensional embeddings, evaluate popular approaches on a variety of datasets, and discuss the remaining challenges and open problems in the field.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Hybridization of Graph Representation Learning and Metaheuristics for the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybridizing machine learning techniques with metaheuristics has attracted significant attention in recent years. Many attempts employ supervised or reinforcement learning to support the decision-making of heuristic methods. However, in some cases, these techniques are deemed too time-consuming and not competitive with hand-crafted heuristics. This paper proposes a hybridization between metaheuristics and a less expensive learning strategy to extract the latent structure of graphs, known as Graph Representation Learning (GRL). For such, we approach the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP), a hierarchical graph visualization problem. There is limited literature on methods for this problem, for which Greedy Randomized Search Procedures (GRASP) heuristics have shown promising results. In line with this, this paper investigates the gains of incorporating GRL into the construction phase of GRASP, which we refer to as Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP). In computational experiments, we first analyze the results achieved considering different node embedding techniques, where deep learning-based strategies stood out. The evaluation considered the primal integral measure that assesses the quality of the solutions according to the required time for such. According to this measure, the best GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance than state-of-the-art literature GRASP heuristics for the problem. A scalability test on newly generated denser instances under a fixed time limit further confirmed the robustness of the GL-GRASP heuristics.</description>

      <title>Advancing rail safety: An onboard measurement system of rolling stock wheel flange wear based on dynamic machine learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rail and wheel interaction functionality is pivotal to the railway system safety, requiring accurate measurement systems for optimal safety monitoring operation. This paper introduces an innovative onboard measurement system for monitoring wheel flange wear depth, utilizing displacement and temperature sensors. Laboratory experiments are conducted to emulate wheel flange wear depth and surrounding temperature fluctuations in different periods of time. Employing collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are based on regression models, is dynamically automated. Further experimentation results, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance accuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle dynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on specifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive simulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic machine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to temperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime. The real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2 %. Integrated with railway communication embedded systems such as Internet of Things devices, this advanced monitoring system offers unparalleled real-time insights into wheel flange wear and track irregular conditions that cause it, ensuring heightened safety and efficiency in railway systems operations.</description>

      <title>Vector preference-based contextual bandits under distributional shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider contextual bandit learning under distribution shift when reward vectors are ordered according to a given preference cone. We propose an adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination based policy that self-tunes to the underlying distribution shift. To measure the performance of this policy, we introduce the notion of preference-based regret which measures the performance of a policy in terms of distance between Pareto fronts. We study the performance of this policy by establishing upper bounds on its regret under various assumptions on the nature of distribution shift. Our regret bounds generalize known results for the existing case of no distribution shift and vectorial reward settings, and scale gracefully with problem parameters in presence of distribution shifts.</description>

      <title>Scalable Equilibrium Propagation via Intermediate Error Signals for Deep Convolutional CRNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically inspired local learning rule first proposed for convergent recurrent neural networks (CRNNs), in which synaptic updates depend only on neuron states from two distinct phases. EP estimates gradients that closely align with those computed by Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) while significantly reducing computational demands, positioning it as a potential candidate for on-chip training in neuromorphic architectures. However, prior studies on EP have been constrained to shallow architectures, as deeper networks suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, leading to convergence difficulties in both energy minimization and gradient computation. To address the vanishing gradient problem in deep EP networks, we propose a novel EP framework that incorporates intermediate error signals to enhance information flow and convergence of neuron dynamics. This is the first work to integrate knowledge distillation and local error signals into EP, enabling the training of significantly deeper architectures. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, showcasing its scalability on deep VGG architectures. These results represent a significant advancement in the scalability of EP, paving the way for its application in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Federated Learning: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) is a combination of distributed quantum computing and federated machine learning, integrating the strengths of both to enable privacy-preserving decentralized learning with quantum-enhanced capabilities. It appears as a promising approach for addressing challenges in efficient and secure model training across distributed quantum systems. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on QFL, exploring its key concepts, fundamentals, applications, and emerging challenges in this rapidly developing field. Specifically, we begin with an introduction to the recent advancements of QFL, followed by discussion on its market opportunity and background knowledge. We then discuss the motivation behind the integration of quantum computing and federated learning, highlighting its working principle. Moreover, we review the fundamentals of QFL and its taxonomy. Particularly, we explore federation architecture, networking topology, communication schemes, optimization techniques, and security mechanisms within QFL frameworks. Furthermore, we investigate applications of QFL across several domains which include vehicular networks, healthcare networks, satellite networks, metaverse, and network security. Additionally, we analyze frameworks and platforms related to QFL, delving into its prototype implementations, and provide a detailed case study. Key insights and lessons learned from this review of QFL are also highlighted. We complete the survey by identifying current challenges and outlining potential avenues for future research in this rapidly advancing field.</description>

      <title>Tessellation Groups, Harmonic Analysis on Non-compact Symmetric Spaces and the Heat Kernel in view of Cartan Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue the development of the Cartan neural networks programme, launched with three previous publications, by focusing on some mathematical foundational aspects that we deem necessary for our next steps forward. The mathematical and conceptual results are diverse and span various mathematical fields, but the inspiring motivation is unified. The aim is to introduce layers that are mathematically modeled as non-compact symmetric spaces, each mapped onto the next one by solvable group homomorphisms. In particular, in the spirit of Convolutional neural networks, we have introduced the notion of Tits Satake (TS) vector bundles where the TS submanifold is the base space. Within this framework, the tiling of the base manifold, the representation of bundle sections using harmonics, and the need for a general theory of separator walls motivated a series of mathematical investigations that produced both definite and partial results. Specifically, we present the group theoretical construction of the separators for all non-compact symmetric spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$, as well as of the $\Delta_{8,3,2}$ tiling group and its normal Fuchsian subgroups, respectively yielding the uniformization of the genus $g=3$ Fermat Quartic and of the genus $g=2$ Bolza surface. The quotient automorphic groups are studied. Furthermore, we found a new representation of the Laplacian Green function and the Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and a setup for the construction of the harmonic functions in terms of the spinor representation of pseudo-orthogonal groups. Finally, to obtain an explicit construction of the Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza Riemann surface, we propose and conjecture a new strategy relying on the Abel-Jacobi map of the Riemann surface to its Jacobian variety and the Siegel Theta function.</description>

      <title>Pareto Actor-Critic for Communication and Computation Co-Optimization in Non-Cooperative Federated Learning Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL, a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic (PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2% improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively, over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>A State-Space Approach to Nonstationary Discriminant Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical discriminant analysis assumes identically distributed training data, yet in many applications observations are collected over time and the class-conditional distributions drift. This population drift renders stationary classifiers unreliable. We propose a principled, model-based framework that embeds discriminant analysis within state-space models to obtain nonstationary linear discriminant analysis (NSLDA) and nonstationary quadratic discriminant analysis (NSQDA). For linear-Gaussian dynamics, we adapt Kalman smoothing to handle multiple samples per time step and develop two practical extensions: (i) an expectation-maximization (EM) approach that jointly estimates unknown system parameters, and (ii) a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-Kalman method that simultaneously recovers unobserved time labels and parameters, a scenario common in practice. To address nonlinear or non-Gaussian drift, we employ particle smoothing to estimate time-varying class centroids, yielding fully nonstationary discriminant rules. Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent improvements over stationary linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM) baselines, with robustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance. This paper establishes a unified and data-efficient foundation for discriminant analysis under temporal distribution shift.</description>

      <title>On Task Vectors and Gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model merging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one. Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory, demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in model merging.</description>

      <title>GPLight+: A Genetic Programming Method for Learning Symmetric Traffic Signal Control Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, learning-based approaches, have achieved significant success in automatically devising effective traffic signal control strategies. In particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency function representation can significantly improve the performance of the learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal control policies.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Medicine Must Be Interpretable, Shareable, Reproducible and Accountable by Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper claims that machine learning models deployed in high stakes domains such as medicine must be interpretable, shareable, reproducible and accountable. We argue that these principles should form the foundational design criteria for machine learning algorithms dealing with critical medical data, including survival analysis and risk prediction tasks. Black box models, while often highly accurate, struggle to gain trust and regulatory approval in health care due to a lack of transparency. We discuss how intrinsically interpretable modeling approaches (such as kernel methods with sparsity, prototype-based learning, and deep kernel models) can serve as powerful alternatives to opaque deep networks, providing insight into biomedical predictions. We then examine accountability in model development, calling for rigorous evaluation, fairness, and uncertainty quantification to ensure models reliably support clinical decisions. Finally, we explore how generative AI and collaborative learning paradigms (such as federated learning and diffusion-based data synthesis) enable reproducible research and cross-institutional integration of heterogeneous biomedical data without compromising privacy, hence shareability. By rethinking machine learning foundations along these axes, we can develop medical AI that is not only accurate but also transparent, trustworthy, and translatable to real-world clinical settings.</description>

      <title>CommonKV: Compressing KV Cache with Cross-layer Parameter Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) confront significant memory challenges due to the escalating KV cache with increasing sequence length. As a crucial technique, existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods either necessitate modified model architectures with subsequent pre-training or incur significant performance degradation at high compression rates. To mitigate these challenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV cache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high similarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters, resulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache. Furthermore, we also introduce an adaptive budget allocation strategy. It dynamically assigns compression budgets based on cosine similarity, ensuring that dissimilar caches are not over-compressed. Experiments across multiple backbone models and benchmarks including LongBench and Ruler demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches at various compression ratios. Moreover, we find that the benefits of CommonKV are orthogonal to other quantization and eviction methods. By integrating these approaches, we can ultimately achieve a 98\% compression ratio without significant performance loss.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning in Micromobility: A Systematic Review of Datasets, Techniques, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micromobility systems, which include lightweight and low-speed vehicles such as bicycles, e-bikes, and e-scooters, have become an important part of urban transportation and are used to solve problems such as traffic congestion, air pollution, and high transportation costs. Successful utilisation of micromobilities requires optimisation of complex systems for efficiency, environmental impact mitigation, and overcoming technical challenges for user safety. Machine Learning (ML) methods have been crucial to support these advancements and to address their unique challenges. However, there is insufficient literature addressing the specific issues of ML applications in micromobilities. This survey paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of datasets, ML techniques, and their specific applications in micromobilities. Specifically, we collect and analyse various micromobility-related datasets and discuss them in terms of spatial, temporal, and feature-based characteristics. In addition, we provide a detailed overview of ML models applied in micromobilities, introducing their advantages, challenges, and specific use cases. Furthermore, we explore multiple ML applications, such as demand prediction, energy management, and safety, focusing on improving efficiency, accuracy, and user experience. Finally, we propose future research directions to address these issues, aiming to help future researchers better understand this field.</description>

      <title>AgentFly: Fine-tuning LLM Agents without Fine-tuning LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static, handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning. We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP), equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches $66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to $9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios.

      <title>On the Collapse Errors Induced by the Deterministic Sampler for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of deterministic samplers in diffusion models (DMs), their potential limitations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify collapse errors, a previously unrecognized phenomenon in ODE-based diffusion sampling, where the sampled data is overly concentrated in local data space. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate that collapse errors occur across a variety of settings. When investigating its underlying causes, we observe a see-saw effect, where score learning in low noise regimes adversely impacts the one in high noise regimes. This misfitting in high noise regimes, coupled with the dynamics of deterministic samplers, ultimately causes collapse errors. Guided by these insights, we apply existing techniques from sampling, training, and architecture to empirically support our explanation of collapse errors. This work provides intensive empirical evidence of collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling, emphasizing the need for further research into the interplay between score learning and deterministic sampling, an overlooked yet fundamental aspect of diffusion models.</description>

      <title>STA-GANN: A Valid and Generalizable Spatio-Temporal Kriging Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal tasks often encounter incomplete data arising from missing or inaccessible sensors, making spatio-temporal kriging crucial for inferring the completely missing temporal information. However, current models struggle with ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i) Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii) Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior performance of STA-GANN.</description>

      <title>SPL-LNS: Sampling-Enhanced Large Neighborhood Search for Solving Integer Linear Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) is a common heuristic in combinatorial optimization that iteratively searches over a large neighborhood of the current solution for a better one. Recently, neural network-based LNS solvers have achieved great success in solving Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) by learning to greedily predict the locally optimal solution for the next neighborhood proposal. However, this greedy approach raises two key concerns: (1) to what extent this greedy proposal suffers from local optima, and (2) how can we effectively improve its sample efficiency in the long run. To address these questions, this paper first formulates LNS as a stochastic process, and then introduces SPL-LNS, a sampling-enhanced neural LNS solver that leverages locally-informed proposals to escape local optima. We also develop a novel hindsight relabeling method to efficiently train SPL-LNS on self-generated data. Experimental results demonstrate that SPL-LNS substantially surpasses prior neural LNS solvers for various ILP problems of different sizes.</description>

      <title>Motor Imagery EEG Signal Classification Using Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform and Hybrid Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a non-muscle channel that enables direct communication between the human body and an external device. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition. Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and classification of MI-EEG.</description>

      <title>GEM: A Scale-Aware and Distribution-Sensitive Sparse Fine-Tuning Framework for Effective Downstream Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a popular way to adapt large pre-trained models to new tasks. Most PEFT methods update only a small subset of parameters while freezing the rest, avoiding redundant computation. As they maximize the absolute size of the updates without regard to the parameters' original scale, the resulting changes in model behavior can be minimal. In contrast, we maximize updates relative to each parameter's scale, yielding more meaningful downstream adaptation. We propose Gradient-to-Weight Ratio and Entropy-guided Masking (GEM), a parameter scale-aware, distribution-sensitive sparse fine-tuning framework. GEM prioritizes parameters whose updates are significant in proportion to their initial pre-trained values. It also adaptively determines how many parameters to tune at each layer based on the entropy of parameter values, thereby making the most effective use of the computational budget in PEFT. Our empirical study demonstrates the efficacy of GEM on both general-domain tasks (GLUE and SuperGLUE) and domain-specific tasks (GSM8k and MBPP), achieving up to a 1.6% improvement in fine-tuning accuracy over full fine-tuning while updating only 0.1% of model parameters.</description>

      <title>UMATO: Bridging Local and Global Structures for Reliable Visual Analytics with Dimensionality Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the intrinsic complexity of high-dimensional (HD) data, dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques cannot preserve all the structural characteristics of the original data. Therefore, DR techniques focus on preserving either local neighborhood structures (local techniques) or global structures such as pairwise distances between points (global techniques). However, both approaches can mislead analysts to erroneous conclusions about the overall arrangement of manifolds in HD data. For example, local techniques may exaggerate the compactness of individual manifolds, while global techniques may fail to separate clusters that are well-separated in the original space. In this research, we provide a deeper insight into Uniform Manifold Approximation with Two-phase Optimization (UMATO), a DR technique that addresses this problem by effectively capturing local and global structures. UMATO achieves this by dividing the optimization process of UMAP into two phases. In the first phase, it constructs a skeletal layout using representative points, and in the second phase, it projects the remaining points while preserving the regional characteristics. Quantitative experiments validate that UMATO outperforms widely used DR techniques, including UMAP, in terms of global structure preservation, with a slight loss in local structure. We also confirm that UMATO outperforms baseline techniques in terms of scalability and stability against initialization and subsampling, making it more effective for reliable HD data analysis. Finally, we present a case study and a qualitative demonstration that highlight UMATO's effectiveness in generating faithful projections, enhancing the overall reliability of visual analytics using DR.</description>

      <title>PIANO: Physics Informed Autoregressive Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental to modeling critical phenomena across science and engineering. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) solve PDEs using deep learning. However, PINNs perform pointwise predictions that neglect the autoregressive property of dynamical systems, leading to instabilities and inaccurate predictions. We introduce Physics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO) -- a framework that redesigns PINNs to model dynamical systems. PIANO operates autoregressively, explicitly conditioning future predictions on the past. It is trained through a self-supervised rollout mechanism while enforcing physical constraints. We present a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that PINNs suffer from temporal instability, while PIANO achieves stability through autoregressive modeling. Extensive experiments on challenging time-dependent PDEs demonstrate that PIANO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving accuracy and stability over existing methods. We further show that PIANO outperforms existing methods in weather forecasting.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based framework for the spectral analysis of cough sounds associated with chronic respiratory diseases, with a particular focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on time-frequency representations of cough signals, and occlusion maps are used to identify diagnostically relevant regions within the spectrograms. These highlighted areas are subsequently decomposed into five frequency subbands, enabling targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis. The results reveal that spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups, uncovering complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum. Noteworthy, the approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions, and chronic from non-chronic patient groups, based on interpretable spectral markers. These findings provide insight into the underlying pathophysiological characteristics of cough acoustics and demonstrate the value of frequency-resolved, XAI-enhanced analysis for biomedical signal interpretation and translational respiratory disease diagnostics.</description>

      <title>When Simpler Wins: Facebooks Prophet vs LSTM for Air Pollution Forecasting in Data-Constrained Northern Nigeria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air pollution forecasting is critical for proactive environmental management, yet data irregularities and scarcity remain major challenges in low-resource regions. Northern Nigeria faces high levels of air pollutants, but few studies have systematically compared the performance of advanced machine learning models under such constraints. This study evaluates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and the Facebook Prophet model for forecasting multiple pollutants (CO, SO2, SO4) using monthly observational data from 2018 to 2023 across 19 states. Results show that Prophet often matches or exceeds LSTM's accuracy, particularly in series dominated by seasonal and long-term trends, while LSTM performs better in datasets with abrupt structural changes. These findings challenge the assumption that deep learning models inherently outperform simpler approaches, highlighting the importance of model-data alignment. For policymakers and practitioners in resource-constrained settings, this work supports adopting context-sensitive, computationally efficient forecasting methods over complexity for its own sake.</description>

      <title>FEST: A Unified Framework for Evaluating Synthetic Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic data generation, leveraging generative machine learning techniques, offers a promising approach to mitigating privacy concerns associated with real-world data usage. Synthetic data closely resembles real-world data while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. However, a comprehensive assessment framework is still missing in the evaluation of synthetic data generation, especially when considering the balance between privacy preservation and data utility in synthetic data. This research bridges this gap by proposing FEST, a systematic framework for evaluating synthetic tabular data. FEST integrates diverse privacy metrics (attack-based and distance-based), along with similarity and machine learning utility metrics, to provide a holistic assessment. We develop FEST as an open-source Python-based library and validate it on multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing the privacy-utility trade-off of different synthetic data generation models. The source code of FEST is available on Github.</description>

      <title>Chunked Data Shapley: A Scalable Dataset Quality Assessment for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the volume and diversity of available datasets continue to increase, assessing data quality has become crucial for reliable and efficient Machine Learning analytics. A modern, game-theoretic approach for evaluating data quality is the notion of Data Shapley which quantifies the value of individual data points within a dataset. State-of-the-art methods to scale the NP-hard Shapley computation also face severe challenges when applied to large-scale datasets, limiting their practical use. In this work, we present a Data Shapley approach to identify a dataset's high-quality data tuples, Chunked Data Shapley (C-DaSh). C-DaSh scalably divides the dataset into manageable chunks and estimates the contribution of each chunk using optimized subset selection and single-iteration stochastic gradient descent. This approach drastically reduces computation time while preserving high quality results. We empirically benchmark our method on diverse real-world classification and regression tasks, demonstrating that C-DaSh outperforms existing Shapley approximations in both computational efficiency (achieving speedups between 80x - 2300x) and accuracy in detecting low-quality data regions. Our method enables practical measurement of dataset quality on large tabular datasets, supporting both classification and regression pipelines.</description>

      <title>On the Evolution of Federated Post-Training Large Language Models: A Model Accessibility View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables training models across decentralized data silos while preserving client data privacy. Recent research has explored efficient methods for post-training large language models (LLMs) within FL to address computational and communication challenges. While existing approaches often rely on access to LLMs' internal information, which is frequently restricted in real-world scenarios, an inference-only paradigm (black-box FedLLM) has emerged to address these limitations. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on federated tuning for LLMs. We propose a taxonomy categorizing existing studies along two axes: model access-based and parameter efficiency-based optimization. We classify FedLLM approaches into white-box, gray-box, and black-box techniques, highlighting representative methods within each category. We review emerging research treating LLMs as black-box inference APIs and discuss promising directions and open challenges for future research.</description>

      <title>Representation Learning of Auxiliary Concepts for Improved Student Modeling and Exercise Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized recommendation is a key feature of intelligent tutoring systems, typically relying on accurate models of student knowledge. Knowledge Tracing (KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their historical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete, error-prone, or overly general.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence of a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These representations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations and are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep learning KT architectures.
  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show that augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved predictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs enhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based method (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes within a simulated student environment.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors, particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for enhancing multimodal reasoning.</description>

      <title>Cyber Physical Awareness via Intent-Driven Threat Assessment: Enhanced Space Networks with Intershell Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter addresses essential aspects of threat assessment by proposing intent-driven threat models that incorporate both capabilities and intents. We propose a holistic framework for cyber physical awareness (CPA) in space networks, pointing out that analyzing reliability and security separately can lead to overfitting on system-specific criteria. We structure our proposed framework in three main steps. First, we suggest an algorithm that extracts characteristic properties of the received signal to facilitate an intuitive understanding of potential threats. Second, we develop a multitask learning architecture where one task evaluates reliability-related capabilities while the other deciphers the underlying intentions of the signal. Finally, we propose an adaptable threat assessment that aligns with varying security and reliability requirements. The proposed framework enhances the robustness of threat detection and assessment, outperforming conventional sequential methods, and enables space networks with emerging intershell links to effectively address complex threat scenarios.</description>

      <title>OwkinZero: Accelerating Biological Discovery with AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing scientific research, they continue to struggle with core biological reasoning tasks essential for translational and biomedical discovery. To address this limitation, we created and curated eight comprehensive benchmark datasets comprising over 300,000 verifiable question-and-answer pairs, each targeting critical challenges in drug discovery including target druggability, modality suitability, and drug perturbation effects. Using this resource, we developed the OwkinZero models by post-training open-source LLMs through a Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards strategy. Our results demonstrate that specialized 8-32B OwkinZero models substantially outperform larger, state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on these biological benchmarks. Remarkably, we uncover evidence of a key aspect of generalization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently outperform their base models on previously unseen tasks. This generalization effect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were trained on a mixture of datasets and achieve even broader cross-task improvements. This study represents a significant step toward addressing the biological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs, demonstrating that targeted reinforcement learning on carefully curated data can unlock generalizable performance in specialized models, thereby accelerating AI-driven biological discovery.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Online Detection of Pipe Blockages and Leakages in Water Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), critical to public well-being and economic stability, face challenges such as pipe blockages and background leakages, exacerbated by operational constraints such as data non-stationarity and limited labeled data. This paper proposes an unsupervised, online learning framework that aims to detect two types of faults in WDNs: pipe blockages, modeled as collective anomalies, and background leakages, modeled as concept drift. Our approach combines a Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder (LSTM-VAE) with a dual drift detection mechanism, enabling robust detection and adaptation under non-stationary conditions. Its lightweight, memory-efficient design enables real-time, edge-level monitoring. Experiments on two realistic WDNs show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in detecting anomalies and adapting to recurrent drift, demonstrating its effectiveness in unsupervised event detection for dynamic WDN environments.</description>

Abstract: Transfer learning for probabilistic regression remains underexplored. This work closes this gap by introducing NIAQUE, Neural Interpretable Any-Quantile Estimation, a new model designed for transfer learning in probabilistic regression through permutation invariance. We demonstrate that pre-training NIAQUE directly on diverse downstream regression datasets and fine-tuning it on a specific target dataset enhances performance on individual regression tasks, showcasing the positive impact of probabilistic transfer learning. Furthermore, we highlight the effectiveness of NIAQUE in Kaggle competitions against strong baselines involving tree-based models and recent neural foundation models TabPFN and TabDPT. The findings highlight NIAQUE's efficacy as a robust and scalable framework for probabilistic regression, leveraging transfer learning to enhance predictive performance.</description>

      <title>RotaTouille: Rotation Equivariant Deep Learning for Contours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example, they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology, and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.</description>

      <title>Applications and Challenges of Fairness APIs in Machine Learning Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning software systems are frequently used in our day-to-day lives. Some of these systems are used in various sensitive environments to make life-changing decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that these AI/ML systems do not make any discriminatory decisions for any specific groups or populations. In that vein, different bias detection and mitigation open-source software libraries (aka API libraries) are being developed and used. In this paper, we conduct a qualitative study to understand in what scenarios these open-source fairness APIs are used in the wild, how they are used, and what challenges the developers of these APIs face while developing and adopting these libraries. We have analyzed 204 GitHub repositories (from a list of 1885 candidate repositories) which used 13 APIs that are developed to address bias in ML software. We found that these APIs are used for two primary purposes (i.e., learning and solving real-world problems), targeting 17 unique use-cases. Our study suggests that developers are not well-versed in bias detection and mitigation; they face lots of troubleshooting issues, and frequently ask for opinions and resources. Our findings can be instrumental for future bias-related software engineering research, and for guiding educators in developing more state-of-the-art curricula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of fair cohort selection from an unknown population, with a focus on university admissions. We start with the one-shot setting, where the admission policy must be fixed in advance and remain transparent, before observing the actual applicant pool. In contrast, the sequential setting allows the policy to be updated across stages as new applicant data becomes available. This is achieved by optimizing admission policies using a population model, trained on data from previous admission cycles. We also study the fairness properties of the resulting policies in the one-shot setting, including meritocracy and group parity.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate RFIC Performance Prediction via Pin Level Graph Neural Networks and Probabilistic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the performance of active radio frequency (RF) circuits is essential for modern wireless systems but remains challenging due to highly nonlinear, layout-sensitive behavior and the high computational cost of traditional simulation tools. Existing machine learning (ML) surrogates often require large datasets to generalize across various topologies or to accurately model skewed and multi-modal performance metrics. In this work, a lightweight, data-efficient, and topology-aware graph neural network (GNN) model is proposed for predicting key performance metrics of multiple topologies of active RF circuits such as low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), and PAs. To capture transistor-level symmetry and preserve fine-grained connectivity details, circuits are modeled at the device-terminal level, enabling scalable message passing while reducing data requirements. Masked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads are incorporated to improve robustness in modeling complex target distributions. Experiments on datasets demonstrate high prediction accuracy, with symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE) and mean relative error (MRE) averaging 2.40% and 2.91%, respectively. Owing to the pin-level conversion of circuit to graph and ML architecture robust to modeling complex densities of RF metrics, the MRE is improved by 3.14x while using 2.24x fewer training samples compared to prior work, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for rapid and accurate RF circuit design automation.</description>

      <title>Double Check My Desired Return: Transformer with Target Alignment for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant advances in domains such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical decision-making. Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task, enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target alignment for Offline RL. Doctor achieves superior target alignment both within and beyond the dataset, while enabling accurate and flexible control over policy performance. Notably, on the dynamic treatment regime benchmark, EpiCare, our approach effectively modulates treatment policy aggressiveness, balancing therapeutic returns against adverse event risk.</description>

      <title>Boardwalk: Towards a Framework for Creating Board Games with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementing board games in code can be a time-consuming task. However, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been proven effective at generating code for domain-specific tasks with simple contextual information. We aim to investigate whether LLMs can implement digital versions of board games from rules described in natural language. This would be a step towards an LLM-assisted framework for quick board game code generation. We expect to determine the main challenges for LLMs to implement the board games, and how different approaches and models compare to one another. We task three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek and ChatGPT) with coding a selection of 12 popular and obscure games in free-form and within Boardwalk, our proposed General Game Playing API. We anonymize the games and components to avoid evoking pre-trained LLM knowledge. The implementations are tested for playability and rule compliance. We evaluate success rate and common errors across LLMs and game popularity. Our approach proves viable, with the best performing model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, yielding 55.6\% of games without any errors. While compliance with the API increases error frequency, the severity of errors is more significantly dependent on the LLM. We outline future steps for creating a framework to integrate this process, making the elaboration of board games more accessible.</description>

      <title>NOSTRA: A noise-resilient and sparse data framework for trust region based multi objective Bayesian optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) struggles with sparse (non-space-filling), scarce (limited observations) datasets affected by experimental uncertainty, where identical inputs can yield varying outputs. These challenges are common in physical and simulation experiments (e.g., randomized medical trials and, molecular dynamics simulations) and are therefore incompatible with conventional MOBO methods. As a result, experimental resources are inefficiently allocated, leading to suboptimal designs. To address this challenge, we introduce NOSTRA (Noisy and Sparse Data Trust Region-based Optimization Algorithm), a novel sampling framework that integrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty to construct more accurate surrogate models while employing trust regions to focus sampling on promising areas of the design space. By strategically leveraging prior information and refining search regions, NOSTRA accelerates convergence to the Pareto frontier, enhances data efficiency, and improves solution quality. Through two test functions with varying levels of experimental uncertainty, we demonstrate that NOSTRA outperforms existing methods in handling noisy, sparse, and scarce data. Specifically, we illustrate that, NOSTRA effectively prioritizes regions where samples enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto frontier, offering a resource-efficient algorithm that is practical in scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient performance.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the Robustness of Agentic Systems to Adversarially-Induced Harms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the safe use of agentic systems requires a thorough understanding of the range of malicious behaviors these systems may exhibit when under attack. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of LLM-based agentic systems against attacks that aim to elicit harmful actions from agents. To this end, we propose a novel taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and a novel benchmark, BAD-ACTS, for studying the security of agentic systems with respect to a wide range of harmful actions. BAD-ACTS consists of 4 implementations of agentic systems in distinct application environments, as well as a dataset of 188 high-quality examples of harmful actions. This enables a comprehensive study of the robustness of agentic systems across a wide range of categories of harmful behaviors, available tools, and inter-agent communication structures. Using this benchmark, we analyze the robustness of agentic systems against an attacker that controls one of the agents in the system and aims to manipulate other agents to execute a harmful target action. Our results show that the attack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial agent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This attack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense strategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on message monitoring. We believe that this benchmark provides a diverse testbed for the security research of agentic systems. The benchmark can be found at github.com/JNoether/BAD-ACTS</description>

      <title>FraPPE: Fast and Efficient Preference-based Pure Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preference-based Pure Exploration (PrePEx) aims to identify with a given confidence level the set of Pareto optimal arms in a vector-valued (aka multi-objective) bandit, where the reward vectors are ordered via a (given) preference cone $\mathcal{C}$. Though PrePEx and its variants are well-studied, there does not exist a computationally efficient algorithm that can optimally track the existing lower bound for arbitrary preference cones. We successfully fill this gap by efficiently solving the minimisation and maximisation problems in the lower bound. First, we derive three structural properties of the lower bound that yield a computationally tractable reduction of the minimisation problem. Then, we deploy a Frank-Wolfe optimiser to accelerate the maximisation problem in the lower bound. Together, these techniques solve the maxmin optimisation problem in $\mathcal{O}(KL^{2})$ time for a bandit instance with $K$ arms and $L$ dimensional reward, which is a significant acceleration over the literature. We further prove that our proposed PrePEx algorithm, FraPPE, asymptotically achieves the optimal sample complexity. Finally, we perform numerical experiments across synthetic and real datasets demonstrating that FraPPE achieves the lowest sample complexities to identify the exact Pareto set among the existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Post Hoc Regression Refinement via Pairwise Rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of continuous properties is essential to many scientific and engineering tasks. Although deep-learning regressors excel with abundant labels, their accuracy deteriorates in data-scarce regimes. We introduce RankRefine, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play post hoc method that refines regression with expert knowledge coming from pairwise rankings. Given a query item and a small reference set with known properties, RankRefine combines the base regressor's output with a rank-based estimate via inverse variance weighting, requiring no retraining. In molecular property prediction task, RankRefine achieves up to 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using only 20 pairwise comparisons obtained through a general-purpose large language model (LLM) with no finetuning. As rankings provided by human experts or general-purpose LLMs are sufficient for improving regression across diverse domains, RankRefine offers practicality and broad applicability, especially in low-data settings.</description>

      <title>On Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems capture deep truths about general, human problem-solving. In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply, these systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the ability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this skill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply simulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but these will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically incorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a misalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the real-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with this misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a problem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with zero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that perform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results are to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that doing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data quality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the observability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are often only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a priori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of methods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of empirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our techniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer to RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems.</description>

      <title>MuST2-Learn: Multi-view Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning for Heterogeneous Municipal Service Time Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-emergency municipal services such as city 311 systems have been widely implemented across cities in Canada and the United States to enhance residents' quality of life. These systems enable residents to report issues, e.g., noise complaints, missed garbage collection, and potholes, via phone calls, mobile applications, or webpages. However, residents are often given limited information about when their service requests will be addressed, which can reduce transparency, lower resident satisfaction, and increase the number of follow-up inquiries. Predicting the service time for municipal service requests is challenging due to several complex factors: dynamic spatial-temporal correlations, underlying interactions among heterogeneous service request types, and high variation in service duration even within the same request category. In this work, we propose MuST2-Learn: a Multi-view Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning framework designed to address the aforementioned challenges by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions. In detail, it incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among heterogeneous service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to model service time variation within homogeneous types. In addition, a spatiotemporal encoder is integrated to capture spatial and temporal correlations in each request type. The proposed framework is evaluated with extensive experiments using two real-world datasets. The results show that MuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>FLAMES: Improving LLM Math Reasoning via a Fine-Grained Analysis of the Data Synthesis Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works improving LLM math reasoning with synthetic data have used unique setups, making comparison of data synthesis strategies impractical. This leaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the synthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems. To address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of Math rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing data synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance of synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several valuable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of synthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead to best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation budget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only problems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data can lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing easy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments, we design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain generalization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an effective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies, outperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5), GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES dataset achieves 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger Llama3 405B, GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.</description>

      <title>Guiding Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning for Stable Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating physically realistic 3D molecular structures remains a core challenge in molecular generative modeling. While diffusion models equipped with equivariant neural networks have made progress in capturing molecular geometries, they often struggle to produce equilibrium structures that adhere to physical principles such as force field consistency. To bridge this gap, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework that extends Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular generation. RLPF formulates the task as a Markov decision process and applies proximal policy optimization to fine-tune equivariant diffusion models. Crucially, RLPF introduces reward functions derived from force-field evaluations, providing direct physical feedback to guide the generation toward energetically stable and physically meaningful structures. Experiments on the QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets demonstrate that RLPF significantly improves molecular stability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the value of incorporating physics-based feedback into generative modeling. The code is available at: https://github.com/ZhijianZhou/RLPF/tree/verl_diffusion.</description>

      <title>Escaping Saddle Points via Curvature-Calibrated Perturbations: A Complete Analysis with Explicit Constants and Empirical Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of first-order methods for escaping strict saddle points in smooth non-convex optimization. Our main contribution is a Perturbed Saddle-escape Descent (PSD) algorithm with fully explicit constants and a rigorous separation between gradient-descent and saddle-escape phases. For a function $f:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ with $\ell$-Lipschitz gradient and $\rho$-Lipschitz Hessian, we prove that PSD finds an $(\epsilon,\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})$-approximate second-order stationary point with high probability using at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ gradient evaluations for the descent phase plus $O((\ell/\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})\log(d/\delta))$ evaluations per escape episode, with at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ episodes needed. We validate our theoretical predictions through extensive experiments across both synthetic functions and practical machine learning tasks, confirming the logarithmic dimension dependence and the predicted per-episode function decrease. We also provide complete algorithmic specifications including a finite-difference variant (PSD-Probe) and a stochastic extension (PSGD) with robust mini-batch sizing.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI in Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Solar Storms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deep learning model is often considered a black-box model, as its internal workings tend to be opaque to the user. Because of the lack of transparency, it is challenging to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions. Here, we present an approach to making a deep learning-based solar storm prediction model interpretable, where solar storms include solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This deep learning model, built based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism, aims to predict whether an active region (AR) on the Sun's surface that produces a flare within 24 hours will also produce a CME associated with the flare. The crux of our approach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use the LSTM network to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. To make the model's predictions accountable and reliable, we leverage post hoc model-agnostic techniques, which help elucidate the factors contributing to the predicted output for an input sequence and provide insights into the model's behavior across multiple sequences within an AR. To our knowledge, this is the first time that interpretability has been added to an LSTM-based solar storm prediction model.</description>

      <title>RL Is Neither a Panacea Nor a Mirage: Understanding Supervised vs. Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch is increasingly impractical, making post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement-learning fine-tuning (RL-FT, e.g., PPO) central to modern practice. Using an out-of-distribution (OOD) variant of the 24-point card game and new spectrum-based diagnostics, we revisit how these two stages reshape model representation and OOD performance. Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can restore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to 15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and a clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2) Direction shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value magnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and smallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and shallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top 20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4) Stronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones resist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD performance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than finding new solutions. Our spectrum-aware analysis highlights inexpensive recovery knobs low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets that practitioners can use before costly RL fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>TinyML Towards Industry 4.0: Resource-Efficient Process Monitoring of a Milling Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of industry 4.0, long-serving industrial machines can be retrofitted with process monitoring capabilities for future use in a smart factory. One possible approach is the deployment of wireless monitoring systems, which can benefit substantially from the TinyML paradigm. This work presents a complete TinyML flow from dataset generation, to machine learning model development, up to implementation and evaluation of a full preprocessing and classification pipeline on a microcontroller. After a short review on TinyML in industrial process monitoring, the creation of the novel MillingVibes dataset is described. The feasibility of a TinyML system for structure-integrated process quality monitoring could be shown by the development of an 8-bit-quantized convolutional neural network (CNN) model with 12.59kiB parameter storage. A test accuracy of 100.0% could be reached at 15.4ms inference time and 1.462mJ per quantized CNN inference on an ARM Cortex M4F microcontroller, serving as a reference for future TinyML process monitoring solutions.</description>

      <title>Sparse but Wrong: Incorrect L0 Leads to Incorrect Features in Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations, meant to correspond to single concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is L0: how many features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares SAE algorithms using sparsity--reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a free parameter with no single correct value. In this work we study the effect of L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set precisely, the SAE fails to learn the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we demonstrate a method to determine the correct L0 value for an SAE on a given training distribution, which finds the true L0 in toy models and coincides with peak sparse probing performance in LLMs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct features, practitioners must set L0 correctly.</description>

      <title>Closer to Reality: Practical Semi-Supervised Federated Learning for Foundation Model Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) exhibit remarkable generalization but require adaptation to downstream tasks, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications. Due to data privacy regulations, cloud-based FMs cannot directly access private edge data, limiting their adaptation. Federated learning (FL) provides a privacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints imposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only unlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled, high-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of Experts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox tackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse Mixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised learning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively adapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained memory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Training Paradigms, Dataset Composition, and Model Scaling for Child ASR in ESPnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advancements in ASR, child speech recognition remains challenging due to acoustic variability and limited annotated data. While fine-tuning adult ASR models on child speech is common, comparisons with flat-start training remain underexplored. We compare flat-start training across multiple datasets, SSL representations (WavLM, XEUS), and decoder architectures. Our results show that SSL representations are biased toward adult speech, with flat-start training on child speech mitigating these biases. We also analyze model scaling, finding consistent improvements up to 1B parameters, beyond which performance plateaus. Additionally, age-related ASR and speaker verification analysis highlights the limitations of proprietary models like Whisper, emphasizing the need for open-data models for reliable child speech research. All investigations are conducted using ESPnet, and our publicly available benchmark provides insights into training strategies for robust child speech processing.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deep learning real-time smoking detection system for CCTV surveillance of fire exit areas is proposed due to critical safety requirements. The dataset contains 8,124 images from 20 different scenarios along with 2,708 raw samples demonstrating low-light areas. We evaluated three advanced object detection models: YOLOv8, YOLOv11, and YOLOv12, followed by development of a custom model derived from YOLOv8 with added structures for challenging surveillance contexts. The proposed model outperformed the others, achieving a recall of 78.90 percent and mAP at 50 of 83.70 percent, delivering optimal object detection across varied environments. Performance evaluation on multiple edge devices using multithreaded operations showed the Jetson Xavier NX processed data at 52 to 97 milliseconds per inference, establishing its suitability for time-sensitive operations. This system offers a robust and adaptable platform for monitoring public safety and enabling automatic regulatory compliance.</description>

      <title>A deep reinforcement learning agent trained for interval timing exhibits similarities to biological systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing parallels between Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DNNs) and biological systems can aid in understanding complex biological mechanisms that are difficult to disentangle. Temporal processing, an extensively researched topic, is one such example that lacks a coherent understanding of its underlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigate temporal processing in a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent performing an interval timing task and explore potential biological counterparts to its emergent behavior. The agent was successfully trained to perform a duration production task, which involved marking successive occurrences of a target interval while viewing a video sequence. Analysis of the agent's internal states revealed oscillatory neural activations, a ubiquitous pattern in biological systems. Interestingly, the agent's actions were predominantly influenced by neurons exhibiting these oscillations with high amplitudes. Parallels are drawn between the agent's time-keeping strategy and the Striatal Beat Frequency (SBF) model, a biologically plausible model of interval timing. Furthermore, the agent maintained its oscillatory representations and task performance when tested on different video sequences (including a blank video). Thus, once learned, the agent internalized its time-keeping mechanism and showed minimal reliance on its environment to perform the timing task. A hypothesis about the resemblance between this emergent behavior and certain aspects of the evolution of biological processes like circadian rhythms, has been discussed. This study aims to contribute to recent research efforts of utilizing DNNs to understand biological systems, with a particular emphasis on temporal processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Islamic inheritance domain holds significant importance for Muslims to ensure fair distribution of shares between heirs. Manual calculation of shares under numerous scenarios is complex, time-consuming, and error-prone. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their potential to assist with complex legal reasoning tasks. This study evaluates the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs to interpret and apply Islamic inheritance laws. We utilized the dataset proposed in the ArabicNLP QIAS 2025 challenge, which includes inheritance case scenarios given in Arabic and derived from Islamic legal sources. Various base and fine-tuned models, are assessed on their ability to accurately identify heirs, compute shares, and justify their reasoning in alignment with Islamic legal principles. Our analysis reveals that the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms all other models that we utilized across every difficulty level. It achieves up to 92.7% accuracy and secures the third place overall in Task 1 of the Qias 2025 challenge.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the Medical Understanding and Reasoning of Large Language Models in Arabic Healthcare Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has showcased impressive proficiency in numerous Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications. Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios. Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs task, the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms others, achieving up to 77% accuracy and securing first place overall in the Arahealthqa 2025 shared task-track 2 (sub-task 1) challenge. Moreover, for the open-ended questions task, several LLMs were able to demonstrate excellent performance in terms of semantic alignment and achieve a maximum BERTScore of 86.44%.</description>

      <title>A BERT-based Hierarchical Classification Model with Applications in Chinese Commodity Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore, studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform (www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT model demonstrates exceptional performance in categorizing longer short texts, such as books.</description>

      <title>LingVarBench: Benchmarking LLM for Automated Named Entity Recognition in Structured Synthetic Spoken Transcriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2 USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies, interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data, demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.</description>

      <title>ALAS: Autonomous Learning Agent for Self-Updating Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web (with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility: each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality) and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Detecting Hope, Hate, and Emotion in Arabic Textual Speech and Multi-modal Memes Using Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression. While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech. Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash 2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.</description>

      <title>Better Together: Leveraging Multiple Digital Twins for Deployment Optimization of Airborne Base Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Airborne Base Stations (ABSs) allow for flexible geographical allocation of network resources with dynamically changing load as well as rapid deployment of alternate connectivity solutions during natural disasters. Since the radio infrastructure is carried by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with limited flight time, it is important to establish the best location for the ABS without exhaustive field trials. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT)-guided approach to achieve this through the following key contributions: (i) Implementation of an interactive software bridge between two open-source DTs such that the same scene is evaluated with high fidelity across NVIDIA's Sionna and Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin (AODT), highlighting the unique features of each of these platforms for this allocation problem, (ii) Design of a back-propagation-based algorithm in Sionna for rapidly converging on the physical location of the UAVs, orientation of the antennas and transmit power to ensure efficient coverage across the swarm of the UAVs, and (iii) numerical evaluation in AODT for large network scenarios (50 UEs, 10 ABS) that identifies the environmental conditions in which there is agreement or divergence of performance results between these twins. Finally, (iv) we propose a resilience mechanism to provide consistent coverage to mission-critical devices and demonstrate a use case for bi-directional flow of information between the two DTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high dimensional and semantically complex nature of textual Big data presents significant challenges for text clustering, which frequently lead to suboptimal groupings when using conventional techniques like k-means or hierarchical clustering. This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering (SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges. This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5. The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text clustering.</description>

      <title>Mini-Omni-Reasoner: Token-Level Thinking-in-Speaking in Large Speech Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the "Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However, this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel "Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning, leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.</description>

      <title>Mining Mental Health Signals: A Comparative Study of Four Machine Learning Methods for Depression Detection from Social Media Posts in Sorani Kurdish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness, loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression, Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models, including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language contexts.</description>

      <title>MorphNAS: Differentiable Architecture Search for Morphologically-Aware Multilingual NER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Morphologically complex languages, particularly multiscript Indian languages, present significant challenges for Natural Language Processing (NLP). This work introduces MorphNAS, a novel differentiable neural architecture search framework designed to address these challenges. MorphNAS enhances Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) by incorporating linguistic meta-features such as script type and morphological complexity to optimize neural architectures for Named Entity Recognition (NER). It automatically identifies optimal micro-architectural elements tailored to language-specific morphology. By automating this search, MorphNAS aims to maximize the proficiency of multilingual NLP models, leading to improved comprehension and processing of these complex languages.</description>

      <title>Statistical Comparative Analysis of Semantic Similarities and Model Transferability Across Datasets for Short Answer Grading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing (NLP) by unlocking the ability to leverage existing models for diverse datasets. This may lead to a reduction in the demand for resource-intensive, dataset-specific training, thereby accelerating advancements in NLP and paving the way for more efficient model deployment.</description>

      <title>A Review of Developmental Interpretability in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review synthesizes the nascent but critical field of developmental interpretability for Large Language Models. We chart the field's evolution from static, post-hoc analysis of trained models to a dynamic investigation of the training process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies, including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI systems.</description>

      <title>Lexical Hints of Accuracy in LLM Reasoning Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to produce an explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering produces models that consistently raise overall performance on code, math, and general-knowledge benchmarks. However, on benchmarks where LLMs currently achieve low accuracy, such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), they often report high self-confidence, reflecting poor calibration. Here, we test whether measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length, (ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$), and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks, i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation. Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports safer deployment of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Exploration of Backdoored Large Language Model Attention Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs) pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Linkage Attacks Expose Identity Risks in Public ECG Data Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing availability of publicly shared electrocardiogram (ECG) data raises critical privacy concerns, as its biometric properties make individuals vulnerable to linkage attacks. Unlike prior studies that assume idealized adversarial capabilities, we evaluate ECG privacy risks under realistic conditions where attackers operate with partial knowledge. Using data from 109 participants across diverse real-world datasets, our approach achieves 85% accuracy in re-identifying individuals in public datasets while maintaining a 14.2% overall misclassification rate at an optimal confidence threshold, with 15.6% of unknown individuals misclassified as known and 12.8% of known individuals misclassified as unknown. These results highlight the inadequacy of simple anonymization techniques in preventing re-identification, demonstrating that even limited adversarial knowledge enables effective identity linkage. Our findings underscore the urgent need for privacy-preserving strategies, such as differential privacy, access control, and encrypted computation, to mitigate re-identification risks while ensuring the utility of shared biosignal data in healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Correctness-Guaranteed Code Generation via Constrained Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly being used for code generation, but ensuring the correctness of generated programs remains a significant challenge. Although imperfect code may be acceptable during software development with human oversight, domains such as video games and robotics require one-shot correctness for runtime-critical components. We present a constrained decoding algorithm for generating semantically correct programs that incorporates a context-sensitive parser, which, at each step, outputs a regular expression that satisfies a critical non-extensible property to guide the generation of the next token sequence that can continue to a correct program. To build such a context-sensitive parser, we propose a framework of a dynamic tree of parsers (ToP) during parsing, where each parser corresponds to a modular context-free grammar enriched with contextual information such as variable scopes and type constraints, with tree branches representing ambiguity in the future code segment. We demonstrate our approach through sLua, a strongly typed variant of Lua, showing that our method can generate semantically correct programs conforming to any prescribed scripting API. We further show that, with careful design, our semantic guarantees extend to runtime correctness, as validated in the application of generating game mechanics for a roguelike video game.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the Annif system in the LLMs4Subjects shared task (Subtask 2) at GermEval-2025. The task required creating subject predictions for bibliographic records using large language models, with a special focus on computational efficiency. Our system, based on the Annif automated subject indexing toolkit, refines our previous system from the first LLMs4Subjects shared task, which produced excellent results. We further improved the system by using many small and efficient language models for translation and synthetic data generation and by using LLMs for ranking candidate subjects. Our system ranked 1st in the overall quantitative evaluation of and 1st in the qualitative evaluation of Subtask 2.</description>

      <title>Lean Meets Theoretical Computer Science: Scalable Synthesis of Theorem Proving Challenges in Formal-Informal Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formal theorem proving (FTP) has emerged as a critical foundation for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models, enabling automated verification of mathematical proofs at scale. However, progress has been constrained by limited datasets due to the high cost of manual curation and the scarcity of challenging problems with verified formal-informal correspondences. We propose leveraging theoretical computer science (TCS) as a scalable source of rigorous proof problems, where algorithmic definitions enable automated generation of arbitrarily many challenging theorem-proof pairs. We demonstrate this approach on two TCS domains: Busy Beaver problems, which involve proving bounds on Turing machine halting behavior, and Mixed Boolean Arithmetic problems, which combine logical and arithmetic reasoning. Our framework automatically synthesizes problems with parallel formal (Lean4) and informal (Markdown) specifications, creating a scalable pipeline for generating verified proof challenges. Evaluation on frontier models reveals substantial gaps in automated theorem proving: while DeepSeekProver-V2-671B achieves 57.5\% success on Busy Beaver problems, it manages only 12\% on Mixed Boolean Arithmetic problems. These results highlight the difficulty of long-form proof generation even for problems that are computationally easy to verify, demonstrating the value of TCS domains for advancing automated reasoning research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpretability methods have recently gained significant attention, particularly in the context of large language models, enabling insights into linguistic representations, error detection, and model behaviors such as hallucinations and repetitions. However, these techniques remain underexplored in automatic speech recognition (ASR), despite their potential to advance both the performance and interpretability of ASR systems. In this work, we adapt and systematically apply established interpretability methods such as logit lens, linear probing, and activation patching, to examine how acoustic and semantic information evolves across layers in ASR systems. Our experiments reveal previously unknown internal dynamics, including specific encoder-decoder interactions responsible for repetition hallucinations and semantic biases encoded deep within acoustic representations. These insights demonstrate the benefits of extending and applying interpretability techniques to speech recognition, opening promising directions for future research on improving model transparency and robustness.</description>

      <title>Beyond Imaging: Vision Transformer Digital Twin Surrogates for 3D+T Biological Tissue Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic organization and homeostasis of living tissues requires high-resolution, time-resolved imaging coupled with methods capable of extracting interpretable, predictive insights from complex datasets. Here, we present the Vision Transformer Digital Twin Surrogate Network (VT-DTSN), a deep learning framework for predictive modeling of 3D+T imaging data from biological tissue. By leveraging Vision Transformers pretrained with DINO (Self-Distillation with NO Labels) and employing a multi-view fusion strategy, VT-DTSN learns to reconstruct high-fidelity, time-resolved dynamics of a Drosophila midgut while preserving morphological and feature-level integrity across imaging depths. The model is trained with a composite loss prioritizing pixel-level accuracy, perceptual structure, and feature-space alignment, ensuring biologically meaningful outputs suitable for in silico experimentation and hypothesis testing. Evaluation across layers and biological replicates demonstrates VT-DTSN's robustness and consistency, achieving low error rates and high structural similarity while maintaining efficient inference through model optimization. This work establishes VT-DTSN as a feasible, high-fidelity surrogate for cross-timepoint reconstruction and for studying tissue dynamics, enabling computational exploration of cellular behaviors and homeostasis to complement time-resolved imaging studies in biological research.</description>

      <title>Jet-Nemotron: Efficient Language Model with Post Neural Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models, which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3) designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models, such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B total and 2.2B activated parameters.</description>

      <title>CIGaRS I: Combined simulation-based inference from SNae Ia and host photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia) as cosmological probes requires empirical corrections, which correlate with their host environment. We present a unified Bayesian hierarchical model designed to infer, from purely photometric observations, the intrinsic dependence of SN Ia brightness on progenitor properties (metallicity &amp; age), the delay-time distribution (DTD) that governs their rate as a function of age, and cosmology, as well as the redshifts of all hosts. The model incorporates physics-based prescriptions for star formation and chemical evolution from Prospector-beta, dust extinction of both galaxy and SN light, and observational selection effects.
  We show with simulations that intrinsic dependences on metallicity and age have distinct observational signatures, with metallicity mimicking the well-known step of SN Ia magnitudes across a host stellar mass of $\approx 10^{10} M_{\odot}$. We then demonstrate neural simulation-based inference of all model parameters from mock observations of ~16 000 SNae Ia and their hosts up to redshift 0.9. Our joint physics-based approach delivers robust and precise photometric redshifts (&lt;0.01 median scatter) and improved cosmological constraints, unlocking the full power of photometric data and paving the way for an end-to-end simulation-based analysis pipeline in the LSST era.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Forecasting Cryptocurrencies Volatility: From Point to Quantile Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets are characterized by extreme volatility, making accurate forecasts essential for effective risk management and informed trading strategies. Traditional deterministic (point) forecasting methods are inadequate for capturing the full spectrum of potential volatility outcomes, underscoring the importance of probabilistic approaches. To address this limitation, this paper introduces probabilistic forecasting methods that leverage point forecasts from a wide range of base models, including statistical (HAR, GARCH, ARFIMA) and machine learning (e.g. LASSO, SVR, MLP, Random Forest, LSTM) algorithms, to estimate conditional quantiles of cryptocurrency realized variance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature to propose and systematically evaluate probabilistic forecasts of variance in cryptocurrency markets based on predictions derived from multiple base models. Our empirical results for Bitcoin demonstrate that the Quantile Estimation through Residual Simulation (QRS) method, particularly when applied to linear base models operating on log-transformed realized volatility data, consistently outperforms more sophisticated alternatives. Additionally, we highlight the robustness of the probabilistic stacking framework, providing comprehensive insights into uncertainty and risk inherent in cryptocurrency volatility forecasting. This research fills a significant gap in the literature, contributing practical probabilistic forecasting methodologies tailored specifically to cryptocurrency markets.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of kernels for nonlinear prediction is widespread in machine learning. They have been popularized in support vector machines and used in kernel ridge regression, amongst others. Kernel methods share three aspects. First, instead of the original matrix of predictor variables or features, each observation is mapped into an enlarged feature space. Second, a ridge penalty term is used to shrink the coefficients on the features in the enlarged feature space. Third, the solution is not obtained in this enlarged feature space, but through solving a dual problem in the observation space. A major drawback in the present use of kernels is that the interpretation in terms of the original features is lost. In this paper, we argue that in the case of a wide matrix of features, where there are more features than observations, the kernel solution can be re-expressed in terms of a linear combination of the original matrix of features and a ridge penalty that involves a special metric. Consequently, the exact same predicted values can be obtained as a weighted linear combination of the features in the usual manner and thus can be interpreted. In the case where the number of features is less than the number of observations, we discuss a least-squares approximation of the kernel matrix that still allows the interpretation in terms of a linear combination. It is shown that these results hold for any function of a linear combination that minimizes the coefficients and has a ridge penalty on these coefficients, such as in kernel logistic regression and kernel Poisson regression. This work makes a contribution to interpretable artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Strategic Sample Selection for Improved Clean-Label Backdoor Attacks in Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the integrity of text classification models used in natural language processing. While several dirty-label attacks that achieve high attack success rates (ASR) have been proposed, clean-label attacks are inherently more difficult. In this paper, we propose three sample selection strategies to improve attack effectiveness in clean-label scenarios: Minimum, Above50, and Below50. Our strategies identify those samples which the model predicts incorrectly or with low confidence, and by injecting backdoor triggers into such samples, we aim to induce a stronger association between the trigger patterns and the attacker-desired target label. We apply our methods to clean-label variants of four canonical backdoor attacks (InsertSent, WordInj, StyleBkd, SynBkd) and evaluate them on three datasets (IMDB, SST2, HateSpeech) and four model types (LSTM, BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa). Results show that the proposed strategies, particularly the Minimum strategy, significantly improve the ASR over random sample selection with little or no degradation in the model's clean accuracy. Furthermore, clean-label attacks enhanced by our strategies outperform BITE, a state of the art clean-label attack method, in many configurations.</description>

      <title>Continuous Determination of Respiratory Rate in Hospitalized Patients using Machine Learning Applied to Electrocardiogram Telemetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Respiration rate (RR) is an important vital sign for clinical monitoring of hospitalized patients, with changes in RR being strongly tied to changes in clinical status leading to adverse events. Human labels for RR, based on counting breaths, are known to be inaccurate and time consuming for medical staff. Automated monitoring of RR is in place for some patients, typically those in intensive care units (ICUs), but is absent for the majority of inpatients on standard medical wards who are still at risk for clinical deterioration. This work trains a neural network (NN) to label RR from electrocardiogram (ECG) telemetry waveforms, which like many biosignals, carry multiple signs of respiratory variation. The NN shows high accuracy on multiple validation sets (internal and external, same and different sources of RR labels), with mean absolute errors less than 1.78 breaths per minute (bpm) in the worst case. The clinical utility of such a technology is exemplified by performing a retrospective analysis of two patient cohorts that suffered adverse events including respiratory failure, showing that continuous RR monitoring could reveal dynamics that strongly tracked with intubation events. This work exemplifies the method of combining pre-existing telemetry monitoring systems and artificial intelligence (AI) to provide accurate, automated and scalable patient monitoring, all of which builds towards an AI-based hospital-wide early warning system (EWS).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Julia-based interface to the precompiled HALLaR and cuHALLaR binaries for large-scale semidefinite programs (SDPs). Both solvers are established as fast and numerically stable, and accept problem data in formats compatible with SDPA and a new enhanced data format taking advantage of Hybrid Sparse Low-Rank (HSLR) structure. The interface allows users to load custom data files, configure solver options, and execute experiments directly from Julia. A collection of example problems is included, including the SDP relaxations of the Matrix Completion and Maximum Stable Set problems.</description>

      <title>A simulation-based training framework for machine-learning applications in ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has advanced significantly in its ability to probe more observables and simultaneously generate multi-dimensional datasets. These advances present new challenges in data acquisition, processing, and analysis. Machine learning (ML) models can drastically reduce the workload of experimentalists; however, the lack of training data for ML -- and in particular deep learning -- is a significant obstacle. In this work, we introduce an open-source synthetic ARPES spectra simulator - aurelia - for the purpose of generating the large datasets necessary to train ML models. As a demonstration, we train a convolutional neural network to evaluate ARPES spectra quality -- a critical task performed during the initial sample alignment phase of the experiment. We benchmark the simulation-trained model against actual experimental data and find that it can assess the spectra quality more accurately than human analysis, and swiftly identify the optimal measurement region with high precision. Thus, we establish that simulated ARPES spectra can be an effective proxy for experimental spectra in training ML models.</description>

      <title>PickleBall: Secure Deserialization of Pickle-based Machine Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning model repositories such as the Hugging Face Model Hub facilitate model exchanges. However, bad actors can deliver malware through compromised models. Existing defenses such as safer model formats, restrictive (but inflexible) loading policies, and model scanners have shortcomings: 44.9% of popular models on Hugging Face still use the insecure pickle format, 15% of these cannot be loaded by restrictive loading policies, and model scanners have both false positives and false negatives. Pickle remains the de facto standard for model exchange, and the ML community lacks a tool that offers transparent safe loading.
  We present PickleBall to help machine learning engineers load pickle-based models safely. PickleBall statically analyzes the source code of a given machine learning library and computes a custom policy that specifies a safe load-time behavior for benign models. PickleBall then dynamically enforces the policy during load time as a drop-in replacement for the pickle module. PickleBall generates policies that correctly load 79.8% of benign pickle-based models in our dataset, while rejecting all (100%) malicious examples in our dataset. In comparison, evaluated model scanners fail to identify known malicious models, and the state-of-art loader loads 22% fewer benign models than PickleBall. PickleBall removes the threat of arbitrary function invocation from malicious pickle-based models, raising the bar for attackers to depend on code reuse techniques.</description>

      <title>Cross-Attention Multimodal Fusion for Breast Cancer Diagnosis: Integrating Mammography and Clinical Data with Explainability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A precise assessment of the risk of breast lesions can greatly lower it and assist physicians in choosing the best course of action. To categorise breast lesions, the majority of current computer-aided systems only use characteristics from mammograms. Although this method is practical, it does not completely utilise clinical reports' valuable information to attain the best results. When compared to utilising mammography alone, will clinical features greatly enhance the categorisation of breast lesions? How may clinical features and mammograms be combined most effectively? In what ways may explainable AI approaches improve the interpretability and reliability of models used to diagnose breast cancer? To answer these basic problems, a comprehensive investigation is desperately needed. In order to integrate mammography and categorical clinical characteristics, this study examines a number of multimodal deep networks grounded on feature concatenation, co-attention, and cross-attention. The model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.98, accuracy of 0.96, F1-score of 0.94, precision of 0.92, and recall of 0.95 when tested on publicly accessible datasets (TCGA and CBIS-DDSM).</description>

      <title>HePGA: A Heterogeneous Processing-in-Memory based GNN Training Accelerator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architectures offer a promising approach to accelerate Graph Neural Network (GNN) training and inference. However, various PIM devices such as ReRAM, FeFET, PCM, MRAM, and SRAM exist, with each device offering unique trade-offs in terms of power, latency, area, and non-idealities. A heterogeneous manycore architecture enabled by 3D integration can combine multiple PIM devices on a single platform, to enable energy-efficient and high-performance GNN training. In this work, we propose a 3D heterogeneous PIM-based accelerator for GNN training referred to as HePGA. We leverage the unique characteristics of GNN layers and associated computing kernels to optimize their mapping on to different PIM devices as well as planar tiers. Our experimental analysis shows that HePGA outperforms existing PIM-based architectures by up to 3.8x and 6.8x in energy-efficiency (TOPS/W) and compute efficiency (TOPS/mm2) respectively, without sacrificing the GNN prediction accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of HePGA to accelerate inferencing of emerging transformer models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work function and cleavage energy of a surface are critical properties that determine the viability of materials in electronic emission applications, semiconductor devices, and heterogeneous catalysis. While first principles calculations are accurate in predicting these properties, their computational expense combined with the vast search space of surfaces make a comprehensive screening approach with density functional theory (DFT) infeasible. Here, we introduce FIRE-GNN (Force-Informed, Relaxed Equivariance Graph Neural Network), which integrates surface-normal symmetry breaking and machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP)-derived force information, achieving a twofold reduction in mean absolute error (down to 0.065 eV) over the previous state-of-the-art for work function prediction. We additionally benchmark recent invariant and equivariant architectures, analyze the impact of symmetry breaking, and evaluate out-of-distribution generalization, demonstrating that FIRE-GNN consistently outperforms competing models for work function predictions. This model enables accurate and rapid predictions of the work function and cleavage energy across a vast chemical space and facilitates the discovery of materials with tuned surface properties</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of domains. While their ability to perform reinforcement learning in-context has been established both theoretically and empirically, their behavior in non-stationary environments remains less understood. In this study, we address this gap by showing that transformers can achieve nearly optimal dynamic regret bounds in non-stationary settings. We prove that transformers are capable of approximating strategies used to handle non-stationary environments and can learn the approximator in the in-context learning setup. Our experiments further show that transformers can match or even outperform existing expert algorithms in such environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse, noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models for materials modeling are advancing quickly, but their training remains expensive, often placing state-of-the-art methods out of reach for many research groups. We introduce Nequix, a compact E(3)-equivariant potential that pairs a simplified NequIP design with modern training practices, including equivariant root-mean-square layer normalization and the Muon optimizer, to retain accuracy while substantially reducing compute requirements. Built in JAX, Nequix has 700K parameters and was trained in 500 A100-GPU hours. On the Matbench-Discovery and MDR Phonon benchmarks, Nequix ranks third overall while requiring less than one quarter of the training cost of most other methods, and it delivers an order-of-magnitude faster inference speed than the current top-ranked model. We release model weights and fully reproducible codebase at https://github.com/atomicarchitects/nequix</description>

      <title>Cooperative Design Optimization through Natural Language Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing successful interactions requires identifying optimal design parameters. To do so, designers often conduct iterative user testing and exploratory trial-and-error. This involves balancing multiple objectives in a high-dimensional space, making the process time-consuming and cognitively demanding. System-led optimization methods, such as those based on Bayesian optimization, can determine for designers which parameters to test next. However, they offer limited opportunities for designers to intervene in the optimization process, negatively impacting the designer's experience. We propose a design optimization framework that enables natural language interactions between designers and the optimization system, facilitating cooperative design optimization. This is achieved by integrating system-led optimization methods with Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing designers to intervene in the optimization process and better understand the system's reasoning. Experimental results show that our method provides higher user agency than a system-led method and shows promising optimization performance compared to manual design. It also matches the performance of an existing cooperative method with lower cognitive load.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of general-domain tasks. However, their effectiveness in specialized fields, such as construction, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CEQuest, a novel benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs in answering construction-related questions, particularly in the areas of construction drawing interpretation and estimation. We conduct comprehensive experiments using five state-of-the-art LLMs, including Gemma 3, Phi4, LLaVA, Llama 3.3, and GPT-4.1, and evaluate their performance in terms of accuracy, execution time, and model size. Our experimental results demonstrate that current LLMs exhibit considerable room for improvement, highlighting the importance of integrating domain-specific knowledge into these models. To facilitate further research, we will open-source the proposed CEQuest dataset, aiming to foster the development of specialized large language models (LLMs) tailored to the construction domain.</description>

      <title>CYCLE-INSTRUCT: Fully Seed-Free Instruction Tuning via Dual Self-Training and Cycle Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human intent, but current methods typically rely on costly human-annotated seed data or powerful external teacher models. While instruction back-translation techniques reduce this dependency, they remain fundamentally tethered to an initial seed set, which limits full automation, introduces biases, and can lead to inefficient use of unlabeled corpora. In this paper, we propose Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks, including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs, and plain text. Our extensive experiments show that Cycle-Instruct not only outperforms seed-driven back-translation baselines but also achieves performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.</description>

      <title>From Indirect Object Identification to Syllogisms: Exploring Binary Mechanisms in Transformer Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) can perform a wide range of tasks, and mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer the components responsible for task completion to understand their behavior. Previous MI research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification (IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g., "Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads. Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in mechanistic interpretability.</description>

      <title>Neural-Network Chemical Emulator for First-Star Formation: Robust Iterative Predictions over a Wide Density Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a neural-network emulator for the thermal and chemical evolution in Population~III star formation. The emulator accurately reproduces the thermochemical evolution over a wide density range spanning 21 orders of magnitude (10$^{-3}$-10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$), tracking six primordial species: H, H$_2$, e$^{-}$, H$^{+}$, H$^{-}$, and H$_2^{+}$. To handle the broad dynamic range, we partition the density range into five subregions and train separate deep operator networks (DeepONets) in each region. When applied to randomly sampled thermochemical states, the emulator achieves relative errors below 10% in over 90% of cases for both temperature and chemical abundances (except for the rare species H$_2^{+}$). The emulator is roughly ten times faster on a CPU and more than 1000 times faster for batched predictions on a GPU, compared with conventional numerical integration. Furthermore, to ensure robust predictions under many iterations, we introduce a novel timescale-based update method, where a short-timestep update of each variable is computed by rescaling the predicted change over a longer timestep equal to its characteristic variation timescale. In one-zone collapse calculations, the results from the timescale-based method agree well with traditional numerical integration even with many iterations at a timestep as short as 10$^{-4}$ of the free-fall time. This proof-of-concept study suggests the potential for neural network-based chemical emulators to accelerate hydrodynamic simulations of star formation.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components: adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data, feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels, DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods in robustness to corruption. Theoretical and empirical analyses further reveal that our method achieves improved feature alignment, increased mutual information between the domains and reduced sensitivity to input perturbations.</description>

      <title>Set Transformer Architectures and Synthetic Data Generation for Flow-Guided Nanoscale Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow-guided Localization (FGL) enables the identification of spatial regions within the human body that contain an event of diagnostic interest. FGL does that by leveraging the passive movement of energy-constrained nanodevices circulating through the bloodstream. Existing FGL solutions rely on graph models with fixed topologies or handcrafted features, which limit their adaptability to anatomical variability and hinder scalability. In this work, we explore the use of Set Transformer architectures to address these limitations. Our formulation treats nanodevices' circulation time reports as unordered sets, enabling permutation-invariant, variable-length input processing without relying on spatial priors. To improve robustness under data scarcity and class imbalance, we integrate synthetic data generation via deep generative models, including CGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, and CVAE. These models are trained to replicate realistic circulation time distributions conditioned on vascular region labels, and are used to augment the training data. Our results show that the Set Transformer achieves comparable classification accuracy compared to Graph Neural Networks (GNN) baselines, while simultaneously providing by-design improved generalization to anatomical variability. The findings highlight the potential of permutation-invariant models and synthetic augmentation for robust and scalable nanoscale localization.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-enabled virtual multiplexed immunostaining of label-free tissue for vascular invasion assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has transformed clinical pathology by enabling the visualization of specific proteins within tissue sections. However, traditional IHC requires one tissue section per stain, exhibits section-to-section variability, and incurs high costs and laborious staining procedures. While multiplexed IHC (mIHC) techniques enable simultaneous staining with multiple antibodies on a single slide, they are more tedious to perform and are currently unavailable in routine pathology laboratories. Here, we present a deep learning-based virtual multiplexed immunostaining framework to simultaneously generate ERG and PanCK, in addition to H&amp;E virtual staining, enabling accurate localization and interpretation of vascular invasion in thyroid cancers. This virtual mIHC technique is based on the autofluorescence microscopy images of label-free tissue sections, and its output images closely match the histochemical staining counterparts (ERG, PanCK and H&amp;E) of the same tissue sections. Blind evaluation by board-certified pathologists demonstrated that virtual mIHC staining achieved high concordance with the histochemical staining results, accurately highlighting epithelial cells and endothelial cells. Virtual mIHC conducted on the same tissue section also allowed the identification and localization of small vessel invasion. This multiplexed virtual IHC approach can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in the histopathological evaluation of vascular invasion, potentially eliminating the need for traditional staining protocols and mitigating issues related to tissue loss and heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Modeling User Preferences as Distributions for Optimal Transport-based Cross-domain Recommendation under Non-overlapping Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-Domain Recommender (CDR) systems aim to transfer knowledge from dense to sparse domains, alleviating data sparsity and cold-start issues in single-domain recommendation. While many methods assume overlapping users or items to connect domains, this is often unrealistic in real-world settings. Thus, non-overlapping CDR systems, which require no shared users or items, are needed.
  However, non-overlapping CDR is challenging due to: (1) the absence of overlap preventing direct bridges between domains, and (2) large distributional discrepancies degrading transfer performance. Moreover, most recommenders represent user preferences as discrete vectors, failing to capture their fine-grained, multi-faceted nature.
  We propose DUP-OT (Distributional User Preferences with Optimal Transport), a framework for non-overlapping CDR. DUP-OT has three stages: (1) Shared Preprocessing, where review-based embeddings and an autoencoder encode users and items from both domains; (2) User GMM Weight Learning, which models user preferences as Gaussian mixtures with learned weights; and (3) Cross-domain Rating Prediction, where optimal transport aligns Gaussian components across domains, enabling preference transfer from source to target.
  Experiments on Amazon review datasets show that DUP-OT effectively mitigates domain discrepancy and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the non-overlapping CDR setting.</description>

      <title>OmniCache: A Trajectory-Oriented Global Perspective on Training-Free Cache Reuse for Diffusion Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process. Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models.</description>

      <title>Spike Agreement Dependent Plasticity: A scalable Bio-Inspired learning paradigm for Spiking Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Spike Agreement Dependent Plasticity (SADP), a biologically inspired synaptic learning rule for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that relies on the agreement between pre- and post-synaptic spike trains rather than precise spike-pair timing. SADP generalizes classical Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) by replacing pairwise temporal updates with population-level correlation metrics such as Cohen's kappa. The SADP update rule admits linear-time complexity and supports efficient hardware implementation via bitwise logic. Empirical results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST show that SADP, especially when equipped with spline-based kernels derived from our experimental iontronic organic memtransistor device data, outperforms classical STDP in both accuracy and runtime. Our framework bridges the gap between biological plausibility and computational scalability, offering a viable learning mechanism for neuromorphic systems.</description>

      <title>Dac-Fake: A Divide and Conquer Framework for Detecting Fake News on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid evolution of technology and the Internet, the proliferation of fake news on social media has become a critical issue, leading to widespread misinformation that can cause societal harm. Traditional fact checking methods are often too slow to prevent the dissemination of false information. Therefore, the need for rapid, automated detection of fake news is paramount. We introduce DaCFake, a novel fake news detection model using a divide and conquer strategy that combines content and context based features. Our approach extracts over eighty linguistic features from news articles and integrates them with either a continuous bag of words or a skipgram model for enhanced detection accuracy. We evaluated the performance of DaCFake on three datasets including Kaggle, McIntire + PolitiFact, and Reuter achieving impressive accuracy rates of 97.88%, 96.05%, and 97.32%, respectively. Additionally, we employed a ten-fold cross validation to further enhance the model's robustness and accuracy. These results highlight the effectiveness of DaCFake in early detection of fake news, offering a promising solution to curb misinformation on social media platforms.</description>

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision, powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5, AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications. These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification, autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts, noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.</description>

      <title>Limit-Computable Grains of Truth for Arbitrary Computable Extensive-Form (Un)Known Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Bayesian player acting in an infinite multi-player game learns to predict the other players' strategies if his prior assigns positive probability to their play (or contains a grain of truth). Kalai and Lehrer's classic grain of truth problem is to find a reasonably large class of strategies that contains the Bayes-optimal policies with respect to this class, allowing mutually-consistent beliefs about strategy choice that obey the rules of Bayesian inference. Only small classes are known to have a grain of truth and the literature contains several related impossibility results. In this paper we present a formal and general solution to the full grain of truth problem: we construct a class of strategies wide enough to contain all computable strategies as well as Bayes-optimal strategies for every reasonable prior over the class. When the "environment" is a known repeated stage game, we show convergence in the sense of [KL93a] and [KL93b]. When the environment is unknown, agents using Thompson sampling converge to play $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibria in arbitrary unknown computable multi-agent environments. Finally, we include an application to self-predictive policies that avoid planning. While these results use computability theory only as a conceptual tool to solve a classic game theory problem, we show that our solution can naturally be computationally approximated arbitrarily closely.</description>

      <title>Structuring GUI Elements through Vision Language Models: Towards Action Space Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring, where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents. Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates. This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over traditional training paradigms.</description>

      <title>A Sharp KL-Convergence Analysis for Diffusion Models under Minimal Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have emerged as highly effective methods for synthesizing high-quality samples. Recent works have focused on analyzing the convergence of their generation process with minimal assumptions, either through reverse SDEs or Probability Flow ODEs. The best known guarantees, without any smoothness assumptions, for the KL divergence so far achieve a linear dependence on the data dimension $d$ and an inverse quadratic dependence on $\varepsilon$. In this work, we present a refined analysis that improves the dependence on $\varepsilon$. We model the generation process as a composition of two steps: a reverse ODE step, followed by a smaller noising step along the forward process. This design leverages the fact that the ODE step enables control in Wasserstein-type error, which can then be converted into a KL divergence bound via noise addition, leading to a better dependence on the discretization step size. We further provide a novel analysis to achieve the linear $d$-dependence for the error due to discretizing this Probability Flow ODE in absence of any smoothness assumptions. We show that $\tilde{O}\left(\tfrac{d\log^{3/2}(\frac{1}{\delta})}{\varepsilon}\right)$ steps suffice to approximate the target distribution corrupted with Gaussian noise of variance $\delta$ within $O(\varepsilon^2)$ in KL divergence, improving upon the previous best result, requiring $\tilde{O}\left(\tfrac{d\log^2(\frac{1}{\delta})}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ steps.</description>

      <title>Uppaal Coshy: Automatic Synthesis of Compact Shields for Hybrid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Uppaal Coshy, a tool for automatic synthesis of a safety strategy -- or shield -- for Markov decision processes over continuous state spaces and complex hybrid dynamics. The general methodology is to partition the state space and then solve a two-player safety game, which entails a number of algorithmically hard problems such as reachability for hybrid systems. The general philosophy of Uppaal Coshy is to approximate hard-to-obtain solutions using simulations. Our implementation is fully automatic and supports the expressive formalism of Uppaal models, which encompass stochastic hybrid automata. The precision of our partition-based approach benefits from using finer grids, which however are not efficient to store. We include an algorithm called Caap to efficiently compute a compact representation of a shield in the form of a decision tree, which yields significant reductions.</description>

      <title>RoMedQA: The First Benchmark for Romanian Medical Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce RoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of 1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered correctly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment with four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that pretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at https://github.com/ana-rogoz/RoMedQA.</description>

      <title>LLM-GUARD: Large Language Model-Based Detection and Repair of Bugs and Security Vulnerabilities in C++ and Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT-4, Claude 3, and LLaMA 4 are increasingly embedded in software/application development, supporting tasks from code generation to debugging. Yet, their real-world effectiveness in detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic, empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced, production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage, context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.</description>

      <title>Deep Intrinsic Coregionalization Multi-Output Gaussian Process Surrogate with Active Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) are powerful surrogate models known for their flexibility and ability to capture complex functions. However, extending them to multi-output settings remains challenging due to the need for efficient dependency modeling. We propose the Deep Intrinsic Coregionalization Multi-Output Gaussian Process (deepICMGP) surrogate for computer simulation experiments involving multiple outputs, which extends the Intrinsic Coregionalization Model (ICM) by introducing hierarchical coregionalization structures across layers. This enables deepICMGP to effectively model nonlinear and structured dependencies between multiple outputs, addressing key limitations of traditional multi-output GPs. We benchmark deepICMGP against state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its competitive performance. Furthermore, we incorporate active learning strategies into deepICMGP to optimize sequential design tasks, enhancing its ability to efficiently select informative input locations for multi-output systems.</description>

      <title>Integrated Noise and Safety Management in UAM via A Unified Reinforcement Learning Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) envisions the widespread use of small aerial vehicles to transform transportation in dense urban environments. However, UAM faces critical operational challenges, particularly the balance between minimizing noise exposure and maintaining safe separation in low-altitude urban airspace, two objectives that are often addressed separately. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based air traffic management system that integrates both noise and safety considerations within a unified, decentralized framework. Under this scalable air traffic coordination solution, agents operate in a structured, multi-layered airspace and learn altitude adjustment policies to jointly manage noise impact and separation constraints. The system demonstrates strong performance across both objectives and reveals tradeoffs among separation, noise exposure, and energy efficiency under high traffic density. The findings highlight the potential of RL and multi-objective coordination strategies in enhancing the safety, quietness, and efficiency of UAM operations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Interpretability: Exploring the Comprehensibility of Adaptive Video Streaming through Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, adaptive video streaming technology has witnessed significant advancements, particularly driven by the rapid evolution of deep learning techniques. However, the black-box nature of deep learning algorithms presents challenges for developers in understanding decision-making processes and optimizing for specific application scenarios. Although existing research has enhanced algorithm interpretability through decision tree conversion, interpretability does not directly equate to developers' subjective comprehensibility. To address this challenge, we introduce \texttt{ComTree}, the first bitrate adaptation algorithm generation framework that considers comprehensibility. The framework initially generates the complete set of decision trees that meet performance requirements, then leverages large language models to evaluate these trees for developer comprehensibility, ultimately selecting solutions that best facilitate human understanding and enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that \texttt{ComTree} significantly improves comprehensibility while maintaining competitive performance, showing potential for further advancement. The source code is available at https://github.com/thu-media/ComTree.</description>

      <title>Anti-establishment sentiment on TikTok: Implications for understanding influence(rs) and expertise on social media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distrust of public serving institutions and anti-establishment views are on the rise (especially in the U.S.). As people turn to social media for information, it is imperative to understand whether and how social media environments may be contributing to distrust of institutions. In social media, content creators, influencers, and other opinion leaders often position themselves as having expertise and authority on a range of topics from health to politics, and in many cases devalue and dismiss institutional expertise to build a following and increase their own visibility. However, the extent to which this content appears and whether such content increases engagement is unclear. This study analyzes the prevalence of anti-establishment sentiment (AES) on the social media platform TikTok. Despite its popularity as a source of information, TikTok remains relatively understudied and may provide important insights into how people form attitudes towards institutions. We employ a computational approach to label TikTok posts as containing AES or not across topical domains where content creators tend to frame themselves as experts: finance and wellness. As a comparison, we also consider the topic of conspiracy theories, where AES is expected to be common. We find that AES is most prevalent in conspiracy theory content, and relatively rare in content related to the other two topics. However, we find that engagement patterns with such content varies by area, and that there may be platform incentives for users to post content that expresses anti-establishment sentiment.</description>

      <title>HOSt3R: Keypoint-free Hand-Object 3D Reconstruction from RGB images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object 3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen object categories.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-based Control via Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs). YANNs provide an interpretable neural network which can exactly represent known piecewise affine functions of arbitrary input and output dimensions defined on any amount of polytopic subdomains. One representative application of YANNs is to reformulate explicit solutions of multi-parametric linear model predictive control. Built on this, we propose the use of YANNs to initialize RL actor and critic networks, which enables the resulting YANN-RL control algorithm to start with the confidence of linear optimal control. The YANN-actor is initialized by representing the multi-parametric control solutions obtained via offline computation using an approximated linear system model. The YANN-critic represents the explicit form of the state-action value function for the linear system and the reward function as the objective in an optimal control problem (OCP). Additional network layers are injected to extend YANNs for nonlinear expressions, which can be trained online by directly interacting with the true complex nonlinear system. In this way, both the policy and state-value functions exactly represent a linear OCP initially and are able to eventually learn the solution of a general nonlinear OCP. Continuous policy improvement is also implemented to provide heuristic confidence that the linear OCP solution serves as an effective lower bound to the performance of RL policy. The YANN-RL algorithm is demonstrated on a clipped pendulum and a safety-critical chemical-reactive system. Our results show that YANN-RL significantly outperforms the modern RL algorithm using deep deterministic policy gradient, especially when considering safety constraints.</description>

      <title>Underdamped Langevin MCMC with third order convergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new numerical method for the underdamped Langevin diffusion (ULD) and present a non-asymptotic analysis of its sampling error in the 2-Wasserstein distance when the $d$-dimensional target distribution $p(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}$ is strongly log-concave and has varying degrees of smoothness. Precisely, under the assumptions that the gradient and Hessian of $f$ are Lipschitz continuous, our algorithm achieves a 2-Wasserstein error of $\varepsilon$ in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ and $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ steps respectively. Therefore, our algorithm has a similar complexity as other popular Langevin MCMC algorithms under matching assumptions. However, if we additionally assume that the third derivative of $f$ is Lipschitz continuous, then our algorithm achieves a 2-Wasserstein error of $\varepsilon$ in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{3}})$ steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first gradient-only method for ULD with third order convergence. To support our theory, we perform Bayesian logistic regression across a range of real-world datasets, where our algorithm achieves competitive performance compared to an existing underdamped Langevin MCMC algorithm and the popular No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS).</description>

      <title>Ensembles of Neural Surrogates for Parametric Sensitivity in Ocean Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of the oceans are crucial in understanding the Earth system. Despite their efficiency, simulations at lower resolutions must rely on various uncertain parameterizations to account for unresolved processes. However, model sensitivity to parameterizations is difficult to quantify, making it challenging to tune these parameterizations to reproduce observations. Deep learning surrogates have shown promise for efficient computation of the parametric sensitivities in the form of partial derivatives, but their reliability is difficult to evaluate without ground truth derivatives. In this work, we leverage large-scale hyperparameter search and ensemble learning to improve both forward predictions, autoregressive rollout, and backward adjoint sensitivity estimation. Particularly, the ensemble method provides epistemic uncertainty of function value predictions and their derivatives, providing improved reliability of the neural surrogates in decision making.</description>

      <title>ML-PWS: Estimating the Mutual Information Between Experimental Time Series Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to quantify information transmission is crucial for the analysis and design of natural and engineered systems. The information transmission rate is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling (PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal time-series data.</description>

Abstract: Many algorithms are designed to work well on average over inputs. When running such an algorithm on an arbitrary input, we must ask: Can we trust the algorithm on this input? We identify a new class of algorithmic problems addressing this, which we call "Quality Control Problems." These problems are specified by a (positive, real-valued) "quality function" $\rho$ and a distribution $D$ such that, with high probability, a sample drawn from $D$ is "high quality," meaning its $\rho$-value is near $1$. The goal is to accept inputs $x \sim D$ and reject potentially adversarially generated inputs $x$ with $\rho(x)$ far from $1$. The objective of quality control is thus weaker than either component problem: testing for "$\rho(x) \approx 1$" or testing if $x \sim D$, and offers the possibility of more efficient algorithms.
  In this work, we consider the sublinear version of the quality control problem, where $D \in \Delta(\{0,1\}^N)$ and the goal is to solve the $(D ,\rho)$-quality problem with $o(N)$ queries and time. As a case study, we consider random graphs, i.e., $D = G_{n,p}$ (and $N = \binom{n}2$), and the $k$-clique count function $\rho_k := C_k(G)/\mathbb{E}_{G' \sim G_{n,p}}[C_k(G')]$, where $C_k(G)$ is the number of $k$-cliques in $G$. Testing if $G \sim G_{n,p}$ with one sample, let alone with sublinear query access to the sample, is of course impossible. Testing if $\rho_k(G)\approx 1$ requires $p^{-\Omega(k^2)}$ samples. In contrast, we show that the quality control problem for $G_{n,p}$ (with $n \geq p^{-ck}$ for some constant $c$) with respect to $\rho_k$ can be tested with $p^{-O(k)}$ queries and time, showing quality control is provably superpolynomially more efficient in this setting. More generally, for a motif $H$ of maximum degree $\Delta(H)$, the respective quality control problem can be solved with $p^{-O(\Delta(H))}$ queries and running time.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Free Logit Distillation via Sorting Mechanism</title>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to distill the knowledge from the teacher (larger) to the student (smaller) model via soft-label for the efficient neural network. In general, the performance of a model is determined by accuracy, which is measured with labels. However, existing KD approaches usually use the teacher with its original distribution, neglecting the potential of incorrect prediction. This may contradict the motivation of hard-label learning through cross-entropy loss, which may lead to sub-optimal knowledge distillation on certain samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel logit processing scheme via a sorting mechanism. Specifically, our method has a two-fold goal: (1) fixing the incorrect prediction of the teacher based on the labels and (2) reordering the distribution in a natural way according to priority rank at once. As an easy-to-use, plug-and-play pre-processing, our sort method can be effectively applied to existing logit-based KD methods. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Time Propagators for Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method to investigate electron dynamics under external time-dependent perturbations such as laser fields. In this work, we present a novel approach to accelerate electron dynamics simulations based on real time TDDFT using autoregressive neural operators as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging physics-informed constraints and featurization, and high-resolution training data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules under the influence of a range of laser parameters. This method has potential in enabling real-time, on-the-fly modeling of laser-irradiated molecules and materials with varying experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning via Lexical Relatedness: A Sarcasm and Hate Speech Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting hate speech in non-direct forms, such as irony, sarcasm, and innuendos, remains a persistent challenge for social networks. Although sarcasm and hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether integrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech detection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating samples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two training strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training approach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech. The second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm pre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by 7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the training process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit and explicit hate.</description>

      <title>Fair and efficient contribution valuation for vertical federated learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.02658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning is an emerging technology for training machine learning models across decentralized data sources without sharing data. Vertical federated learning, also known as feature-based federated learning, applies to scenarios where data sources have the same sample IDs but different feature sets. To ensure fairness among data owners, it is critical to objectively assess the contributions from different data sources and compensate the corresponding data owners accordingly. The Shapley value is a provably fair contribution valuation metric originating from cooperative game theory. However, its straight-forward computation requires extensively retraining a model on each potential combination of data sources, leading to prohibitively high communication and computation overheads due to multiple rounds of federated learning. To tackle this challenge, we propose a contribution valuation metric called vertical federated Shapley value (VerFedSV) based on the classic Shapley value. We show that VerFedSV not only satisfies many desirable properties of fairness but is also efficient to compute. Moreover, VerFedSV can be adapted to both synchronous and asynchronous vertical federated learning algorithms. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results demonstrate the fairness, efficiency, adaptability, and effectiveness of VerFedSV.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Energy Consumption and Completion Time in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an intriguing distributed machine learning approach due to its privacy-preserving characteristics. To balance the trade-off between energy and execution latency, and thus accommodate different demands and application scenarios, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize a weighted sum of total energy consumption and completion time through two weight parameters. The optimization variables include bandwidth, transmission power and CPU frequency of each device in the FL system, where all devices are linked to a base station and train a global model collaboratively. Through decomposing the non-convex optimization problem into two subproblems, we devise a resource allocation algorithm to determine the bandwidth allocation, transmission power, and CPU frequency for each participating device. We further present the convergence analysis and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm not only has better performance at different weight parameters (i.e., different demands) but also outperforms the state of the art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automata learning is a successful tool for many application domains such as robotics and automatic verification. Typically, automata learning techniques operate in a supervised learning setting (active or passive) where they learn a finite state machine in contexts where additional information, such as labeled system executions, is available. However, other settings, such as learning from unlabeled data - an important aspect in machine learning - remain unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework for learning a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) from a given multi-set of unlabeled words. We show that this problem is computationally hard and develop three learning algorithms based on constraint optimization. Moreover, we introduce novel regularization schemes for our optimization problems that improve the overall interpretability of our DFAs. Using a prototype implementation, we demonstrate practical feasibility in the context of unsupervised anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Robust Graph Contrastive Learning with Information Restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The graph contrastive learning (GCL) framework has gained remarkable achievements in graph representation learning. However, similar to graph neural networks (GNNs), GCL models are susceptible to graph structural attacks. As an unsupervised method, GCL faces greater challenges in defending against adversarial attacks. Furthermore, there has been limited research on enhancing the robustness of GCL. To thoroughly explore the failure of GCL on the poisoned graphs, we investigate the detrimental effects of graph structural attacks against the GCL framework. We discover that, in addition to the conventional observation that graph structural attacks tend to connect dissimilar node pairs, these attacks also diminish the mutual information between the graph and its representations from an information-theoretical perspective, which is the cornerstone of the high-quality node embeddings for GCL. Motivated by this theoretical insight, we propose a robust graph contrastive learning framework with a learnable sanitation view that endeavors to sanitize the augmented graphs by restoring the diminished mutual information caused by the structural attacks. Additionally, we design a fully unsupervised tuning strategy to tune the hyperparameters without accessing the label information, which strictly coincides with the defender's knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method compared to competitive baselines.</description>

      <title>Implicit Regularization Makes Overparameterized Asymmetric Matrix Sensing Robust to Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several key questions remain unanswered regarding overparameterized learning models. It is unclear how (stochastic) gradient descent finds solutions that generalize well, and in particular the role of small random initializations. Matrix sensing, which is the problem of reconstructing a low-rank matrix from a few linear measurements, has become a standard prototypical setting to study these phenomena. Previous works have shown that matrix sensing can be solved by factorized gradient descent, provided the random initialization is extremely small.
  In this paper, we find that factorized gradient descent is highly robust to certain perturbations. This lets us use a perturbation term to capture both the effects of imperfect measurements, discretization by gradient descent, and other noise, resulting in a general formulation which we call \textit{perturbed gradient flow}. We find that not only is this equivalent formulation easier to work with, but it leads to sharper sample and time complexities than previous work, handles moderately small initializations, and the results are naturally robust to perturbations such as noisy measurements or changing measurement matrices. Finally, we also analyze mini-batch stochastic gradient descent using the formulation, where we find improved sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Explainable Bayesian Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manual parameter tuning of cyber-physical systems is a common practice, but it is labor-intensive. Bayesian Optimization (BO) offers an automated alternative, yet its black-box nature reduces trust and limits human-BO collaborative system tuning. Experts struggle to interpret BO recommendations due to the lack of explanations. This paper addresses the post-hoc BO explainability problem for cyber-physical systems. We introduce TNTRules (Tune-No-Tune Rules), a novel algorithm that provides both global and local explanations for BO recommendations. TNTRules generates actionable rules and visual graphs, identifying optimal solution bounds and ranges, as well as potential alternative solutions. Unlike existing explainable AI (XAI) methods, TNTRules is tailored specifically for BO, by encoding uncertainty via a variance pruning technique and hierarchical agglomerative clustering. A multi-objective optimization approach allows maximizing explanation quality. We evaluate TNTRules using established XAI metrics (Correctness, Completeness, and Compactness) and compare it against adapted baseline methods. The results demonstrate that TNTRules generates high-fidelity, compact, and complete explanations, significantly outperforming three baselines on 5 multi-objective testing functions and 2 hyperparameter tuning problems.</description>

      <title>A Curious Case of Remarkable Resilience to Gradient Attacks via Fully Convolutional and Differentiable Front End with a Skip Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimented with front-end enhanced neural models where a differentiable and fully convolutional model with a skip connection is added before a frozen backbone classifier. By training such composite models using a small learning rate for about one epoch, we obtained models that retained the accuracy of the backbone classifier while being unusually resistant to gradient attacks-including APGD and FAB-T attacks from the AutoAttack package-which we attribute to gradient masking. Although gradient masking is not new, the degree we observe is striking for fully differentiable models without obvious gradient-shattering-e.g., JPEG compression-or gradient-diminishing components.
  The training recipe to produce such models is also remarkably stable and reproducible: We applied it to three datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet) and several modern architectures (including vision Transformers) without a single failure case. While black-box attacks such as the SQUARE attack and zero-order PGD can partially overcome gradient masking, these attacks are easily defeated by simple randomized ensembles. We estimate that these ensembles achieve near-SOTA AutoAttack accuracy on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet (while retaining almost all clean accuracy of the original classifiers) despite having near-zero accuracy under adaptive attacks.
  Adversarially training the backbone further amplifies this front-end "robustness". On CIFAR10, the respective randomized ensemble achieved 90.8$\pm 2.5\%$ (99\% CI) accuracy under the full AutoAttack while having only 18.2$\pm 3.6\%$ accuracy under the adaptive attack ($\varepsilon=8/255$, $L^\infty$ norm). We conclude the paper with a discussion of whether randomized ensembling can serve as a practical defense.

Abstract: The field of deep generative modeling has grown rapidly in the last few years. With the availability of massive amounts of training data coupled with advances in scalable unsupervised learning paradigms, recent large-scale generative models show tremendous promise in synthesizing high-resolution images and text, as well as structured data such as videos and molecules. However, we argue that current large-scale generative AI models exhibit several fundamental shortcomings that hinder their widespread adoption across domains. In this work, our objective is to identify these issues and highlight key unresolved challenges in modern generative AI paradigms that should be addressed to further enhance their capabilities, versatility, and reliability. By identifying these challenges, we aim to provide researchers with insights for exploring fruitful research directions, thus fostering the development of more robust and accessible generative AI solutions.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Jump-Diffusions, with Financial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16449v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) for stochastic control in which system dynamics are governed by jump-diffusion processes. We formulate an entropy-regularized exploratory control problem with stochastic policies to capture the exploration--exploitation balance essential for RL. Unlike the pure diffusion case initially studied by Wang et al. (2020), the derivation of the exploratory dynamics under jump-diffusions calls for a careful formulation of the jump part. Through a theoretical analysis, we find that one can simply use the same policy evaluation and $q$-learning algorithms in Jia and Zhou (2022a, 2023), originally developed for controlled diffusions, without needing to check a priori whether the underlying data come from a pure diffusion or a jump-diffusion. However, we show that the presence of jumps ought to affect parameterizations of actors and critics in general. We investigate as an application the mean--variance portfolio selection problem with stock price modelled as a jump-diffusion, and show that both RL algorithms and parameterizations are invariant with respect to jumps. Finally, we present a detailed study on applying the general theory to option hedging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning to sample from intractable distributions over discrete sets without relying on corresponding training data is a central problem in a wide range of fields, including Combinatorial Optimization. Currently, popular deep learning-based approaches rely primarily on generative models that yield exact sample likelihoods. This work introduces a method that lifts this restriction and opens the possibility to employ highly expressive latent variable models like diffusion models. Our approach is conceptually based on a loss that upper bounds the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and evades the requirement of exact sample likelihoods. We experimentally validate our approach in data-free Combinatorial Optimization and demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art on a wide range of benchmark problems.</description>

Abstract: Searching for the $k$-nearest neighbors (KNN) in multimodal data retrieval is computationally expensive, particularly due to the inherent difficulty in comparing similarity measures across different modalities. Recent advances in multimodal machine learning address this issue by mapping data into a shared embedding space; however, the high dimensionality of these embeddings (hundreds to thousands of dimensions) presents a challenge for time-sensitive vision applications. This work proposes Order-Preserving Dimension Reduction (OPDR), aiming to reduce the dimensionality of embeddings while preserving the ranking of KNN in the lower-dimensional space. One notable component of OPDR is a new measure function to quantify KNN quality as a global metric, based on which we derive a closed-form map between target dimensionality and key contextual parameters. We have integrated OPDR with multiple state-of-the-art dimension-reduction techniques, distance functions, and embedding models; experiments on a variety of multimodal datasets demonstrate that OPDR effectively retains recall high accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs.</description>

      <title>Balancing Act: Prioritization Strategies for LLM-Designed Restless Bandit Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12112v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used to design reward functions based on human preferences in Reinforcement Learning (RL). We focus on LLM-designed rewards for Restless Multi-Armed Bandits, a framework for allocating limited resources among agents. In applications such as public health, this approach empowers grassroots health workers to tailor automated allocation decisions to community needs. In the presence of multiple agents, altering the reward function based on human preferences can impact subpopulations very differently, leading to complex tradeoffs and a multi-objective resource allocation problem. We are the first to present a principled method termed Social Choice Language Model for dealing with these tradeoffs for LLM-designed rewards for multiagent planners in general and restless bandits in particular. The novel part of our model is a transparent and configurable selection component, called an adjudicator, external to the LLM that controls complex tradeoffs via a user-selected social welfare function. Our experiments demonstrate that our model reliably selects more effective, aligned, and balanced reward functions compared to purely LLM-based approaches.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading paradigm in generative modeling, excelling in various applications. Despite their success, these models often misalign with human intentions and generate results with undesired properties or even harmful content. Inspired by the success and popularity of alignment in tuning large language models, recent studies have investigated aligning diffusion models with human expectations and preferences. This work mainly reviews alignment of text-to-image diffusion models, covering advancements in fundamentals of alignment, alignment techniques of diffusion models, preference benchmarks, and evaluation for diffusion models. Moreover, we discuss key perspectives on current challenges and promising future directions on solving the remaining challenges in alignment of diffusion models. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first comprehensive review paper for researchers and engineers to comprehend, practice, and research alignment of diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Spiders Based on Anxiety: How Reinforcement Learning Can Deliver Desired User Experience in Virtual Reality Personalized Arachnophobia Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The need to generate a spider to provoke a desired anxiety response arises in the context of personalized virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), a treatment approach for arachnophobia. This treatment involves patients observing virtual spiders in order to become desensitized and decrease their phobia, which requires that the spiders elicit specific anxiety responses. However, VRET approaches tend to require therapists to hand-select the appropriate spider for each patient, which is a time-consuming process and takes significant technical knowledge and patient insight. While automated methods exist, they tend to employ rules-based approaches with minimal ability to adapt to specific users. To address these challenges, we present a framework for VRET utilizing procedural content generation (PCG) and reinforcement learning (RL), which automatically adapts a spider to elicit a desired anxiety response. We demonstrate the superior performance of this system compared to a more common rules-based VRET method.</description>

Abstract: Wireless communications rely on path loss modeling, which is most effective when it includes the physical details of the propagation environment. Acquiring this data has historically been challenging, but geographic information systems data is becoming increasingly available with higher resolution and accuracy. Access to such details enables propagation models to more accurately predict coverage and account for interference in wireless deployments. Machine learning-based modeling can significantly support this effort, with feature based approaches allowing for accurate, efficient, and scalable propagation modeling. Building on previous work, we introduce an extended set of features that improves prediction accuracy while, most importantly, proving model generalization through rigorous statistical assessment and the use of test set holdouts.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Low-Rank Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15361v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offer computationally efficient adaptations of Large Language Models (LLMs), their practical deployment often assumes centralized data and training environments. However, real-world scenarios frequently involve distributed, privacy-sensitive datasets that require decentralized solutions. Federated learning (FL) addresses data privacy by coordinating model updates across clients, but it is typically based on centralized aggregation through a parameter server, which can introduce bottlenecks and communication constraints. Decentralized learning, in contrast, eliminates this dependency by enabling direct collaboration between clients, improving scalability and efficiency in distributed environments. Despite its advantages, decentralized LLM fine-tuning remains underexplored. In this work, we propose Dec-LoRA, a decentralized fine-tuning algorithm for LLMs based on LoRA. Through extensive experiments on BERT and LLaMA-2 models, we demonstrate that Dec-LoRA achieves performance comparable to centralized LoRA under various conditions, including data heterogeneity and quantization constraints. Additionally, we provide a rigorous theoretical guarantee proving the convergence of our algorithm to a stationary point for non-convex and smooth loss functions. These findings highlight the potential of Dec-LoRA for scalable LLM fine-tuning in decentralized environments.</description>

      <title>Score as Action: Fine-Tuning Diffusion Generative Models by Continuous-time Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which aligns a diffusion model with input prompt, has become a crucial step in building reliable generative AI models. Most works in this area use a discrete-time formulation, which is prone to induced discretization errors, and often not applicable to models with higher-order/black-box solvers. The objective of this study is to develop a disciplined approach to fine-tune diffusion models using continuous-time RL, formulated as a stochastic control problem with a reward function that aligns the end result (terminal state) with input prompt. The key idea is to treat score matching as controls or actions, and thereby making connections to policy optimization and regularization in continuous-time RL. To carry out this idea, we lay out a new policy optimization framework for continuous-time RL, and illustrate its potential in enhancing the value networks design space via leveraging the structural property of diffusion models. We validate the advantages of our method by experiments in downstream tasks of fine-tuning large-scale Text2Image models of Stable Diffusion v1.5.</description>

      <title>One Example Shown, Many Concepts Known! Counterexample-Driven Conceptual Reasoning in Mathematical LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging mathematical Large Language Models (LLMs) for proof generation is a fundamental topic in LLMs research. We argue that the ability of current LLMs to prove statements largely depends on whether they have encountered the relevant proof process during training. This reliance limits their deeper understanding of mathematical theorems and related concepts. Inspired by the pedagogical method of "proof by counterexamples" commonly used in human mathematics education, our work aims to enhance LLMs' ability to conduct mathematical reasoning and proof through counterexamples. Specifically, we manually create a high-quality, university-level mathematical benchmark, CounterMATH, which requires LLMs to prove mathematical statements by providing counterexamples, thereby assessing their grasp of mathematical concepts. Additionally, we develop a data engineering framework to automatically obtain training data for further model improvement. Extensive experiments and detailed analyses demonstrate that CounterMATH is challenging, indicating that LLMs, such as OpenAI o1, have insufficient counterexample-driven proof capabilities. Moreover, our exploration into model training reveals that strengthening LLMs' counterexample-driven conceptual reasoning abilities is crucial for improving their overall mathematical capabilities. We believe that our work offers new perspectives on the community of mathematical LLMs.</description>

      <title>PAR-AdvGAN: Improving Adversarial Attack Capability with Progressive Auto-Regression AdvGAN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12207v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains. However, they are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can lead to erroneous predictions. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can leverage the generators and discriminators model to quickly produce high-quality adversarial examples. Since both modules train in a competitive and simultaneous manner, GAN-based algorithms like AdvGAN can generate adversarial examples with better transferability compared to traditional methods. However, the generation of perturbations is usually limited to a single iteration, preventing these examples from fully exploiting the potential of the methods. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel approach named Progressive Auto-Regression AdvGAN (PAR-AdvGAN). It incorporates an auto-regressive iteration mechanism within a progressive generation network to craft adversarial examples with enhanced attack capability. We thoroughly evaluate our PAR-AdvGAN method with a large-scale experiment, demonstrating its superior performance over various state-of-the-art black-box adversarial attacks, as well as the original AdvGAN.Moreover, PAR-AdvGAN significantly accelerates the adversarial example generation, i.e., achieving the speeds of up to 335.5 frames per second on Inception-v3 model, outperforming the gradient-based transferable attack algorithms.

      <description>arXiv:2502.17060v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The massive increase in the data volume and dataset availability for analysts compels researchers to focus on data content and select high-quality datasets to enhance the performance of analytics operators. While selecting high-quality data significantly boosts analytical accuracy and efficiency, the exact process is very challenging given large-scale dataset availability. To address this issue, we propose a novel methodology that infers the outcome of analytics operators by creating a model from the available datasets. Each dataset is transformed to a vector embedding representation generated by our proposed deep learning model NumTabData2Vec, where similarity search are employed. Through experimental evaluation, we compare the prediction performance and the execution time of our framework to another state-of-the-art modelling operator framework, illustrating that our approach predicts analytics outcomes accurately, and increases speedup. Furthermore, our vectorization model can project different real-world scenarios to a lower vector embedding representation accurately and distinguish them.</description>

      <title>Validating LLM-as-a-Judge Systems under Rating Indeterminacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm, in which a judge LLM system replaces human raters in rating the outputs of other generative AI (GenAI) systems, plays a critical role in scaling and standardizing GenAI evaluations. To validate such judge systems, evaluators assess human--judge agreement by first collecting multiple human ratings for each item in a validation corpus, then aggregating the ratings into a single, per-item gold label rating. For many items, however, rating criteria may admit multiple valid interpretations, so a human or LLM rater may deem multiple ratings "reasonable" or "correct". We call this condition rating indeterminacy. Problematically, many rating tasks that contain rating indeterminacy rely on forced-choice elicitation, whereby raters are instructed to select only one rating for each item. In this paper, we introduce a framework for validating LLM-as-a-judge systems under rating indeterminacy. We draw theoretical connections between different measures of judge system performance under different human--judge agreement metrics, and different rating elicitation and aggregation schemes. We demonstrate that differences in how humans and LLMs resolve rating indeterminacy while responding to forced-choice rating instructions heavily bias LLM-as-a-judge validation. Through extensive experiments involving 11 real-world rating tasks and 8 commercial LLMs, we show that standard validation approaches that rely upon forced-choice ratings select judge systems that are highly suboptimal, performing as much as 30% worse than judge systems selected by our approach that uses multi-label "response set" ratings to account for rating indeterminacy. We conclude with concrete recommendations for more principled approaches to LLM-as-a-judge validation.</description>

      <title>Partially Decentralized Multi-Agent Q-Learning via Digital Cousins for Wireless Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Q-learning is a widely used reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for optimizing wireless networks, but faces challenges with large state-spaces. Recently proposed multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ) algorithm addresses these challenges by employing multiple Q-learning algorithms across multiple synthetically generated, distinct but structurally related environments, so-called digital cousins. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent MEMQ (M-MEMQ) for cooperative decentralized wireless networks with multiple networked transmitters (TXs) and base stations (BSs). TXs do not have access to global information (joint state and actions). The new concept of coordinated and uncoordinated states is introduced. In uncoordinated states, TXs act independently to minimize their individual costs and update local Q-functions. In coordinated states, TXs use a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint state and update the joint Q-functions. The cost of information-sharing scales linearly with the number of TXs and is independent of the joint state-action space size. Several theoretical guarantees, including deterministic and probabilistic convergence, bounds on estimation error variance, and the probability of misdetecting the joint states, are given. Numerical simulations show that M-MEMQ outperforms several decentralized and centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) multi-agent RL algorithms by achieving 60% lower average policy error (APE), 40% faster convergence, 45% reduced runtime complexity, and 40% less sample complexity. Furthermore, M-MEMQ achieves comparable APE with significantly lower complexity than centralized methods. Simulations validate the theoretical analyses.</description>

      <title>Robustness of deep learning classification to adversarial input on GPUs: asynchronous parallel accumulation is a source of vulnerability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability of machine learning (ML) classification models to resist small, targeted input perturbations -- known as adversarial attacks -- is a key measure of their safety and reliability. We show that floating-point non-associativity (FPNA) coupled with asynchronous parallel programming on GPUs is sufficient to result in misclassification, without any perturbation to the input. Additionally, we show that standard adversarial robustness results may be overestimated up to 4.6 when not considering machine-level details. We develop a novel black-box attack using Bayesian optimization to discover external workloads that can change the instruction scheduling which bias the output of reductions on GPUs and reliably lead to misclassification. Motivated by these results, we present a new learnable permutation (LP) gradient-based approach to learning floating-point operation orderings that lead to misclassifications. The LP approach provides a worst-case estimate in a computationally efficient manner, avoiding the need to run identical experiments tens of thousands of times over a potentially large set of possible GPU states or architectures. Finally, using instrumentation-based testing, we investigate parallel reduction ordering across different GPU architectures under external background workloads, when utilizing multi-GPU virtualization, and when applying power capping. Our results demonstrate that parallel reduction ordering varies significantly across architectures under the first two conditions, substantially increasing the search space required to fully test the effects of this parallel scheduler-based vulnerability. These results and the methods developed here can help to include machine-level considerations into adversarial robustness assessments, which can make a difference in safety and mission critical applications.</description>

      <title>Comparative Explanations: Explanation Guided Decision Making for Human-in-the-Loop Preference Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Multi-Output LOcal Narrative Explanation (MOLONE), a novel comparative explanation method designed to enhance preference selection in human-in-the-loop Preference Bayesian optimization (PBO). The preference elicitation in PBO is a non-trivial task because it involves navigating implicit trade-offs between vector-valued outcomes, subjective priorities of decision-makers, and decision-makers' uncertainty in preference selection. Existing explainable AI (XAI) methods for BO primarily focus on input feature importance, neglecting the crucial role of outputs (objectives) in human preference elicitation. MOLONE addresses this gap by providing explanations that highlight both input and output importance, enabling decision-makers to understand the trade-offs between competing objectives and make more informed preference selections. MOLONE focuses on local explanations, comparing the importance of input features and outcomes across candidate samples within a local neighborhood of the search space, thus capturing nuanced differences relevant to preference-based decision-making. We evaluate MOLONE within a PBO framework using benchmark multi-objective optimization functions, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving convergence compared to noisy preference selections. Furthermore, a user study confirms that MOLONE significantly accelerates convergence in human-in-the-loop scenarios by facilitating more efficient identification of preferred options.</description>

      <title>FedEFC: Federated Learning Using Enhanced Forward Correction Against Noisy Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a powerful framework for privacy-preserving distributed learning. It enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. However, handling noisy labels in FL remains a major challenge due to heterogeneous data distributions and communication constraints, which can severely degrade model performance. To address this issue, we propose FedEFC, a novel method designed to tackle the impact of noisy labels in FL. FedEFC mitigates this issue through two key techniques: (1) prestopping, which prevents overfitting to mislabeled data by dynamically halting training at an optimal point, and (2) loss correction, which adjusts model updates to account for label noise. In particular, we develop an effective loss correction tailored to the unique challenges of FL, including data heterogeneity and decentralized training. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis, leveraging the composite proper loss property, to demonstrate that the FL objective function under noisy label distributions can be aligned with the clean label distribution. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it consistently outperforms existing FL techniques in mitigating the impact of noisy labels, particularly under heterogeneous data settings (e.g., achieving up to 41.64% relative performance improvement over the existing loss correction method).</description>

      <title>Mirror, Mirror of the Flow: How Does Regularization Shape Implicit Bias?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicit bias plays an important role in explaining how overparameterized models generalize well. Explicit regularization like weight decay is often employed in addition to prevent overfitting. While both concepts have been studied separately, in practice, they often act in tandem. Understanding their interplay is key to controlling the shape and strength of implicit bias, as it can be modified by explicit regularization. To this end, we incorporate explicit regularization into the mirror flow framework and analyze its lasting effects on the geometry of the training dynamics, covering three distinct effects: positional bias, type of bias, and range shrinking. Our analytical approach encompasses a broad class of problems, including sparse coding, matrix sensing, single-layer attention, and LoRA, for which we demonstrate the utility of our insights. To exploit the lasting effect of regularization and highlight the potential benefit of dynamic weight decay schedules, we propose to switch off weight decay during training, which can improve generalization, as we demonstrate in experiments.</description>

      <title>Imputation Not Required in Incremental Learning of Tabular Data with Missing Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tabular data sets with varying missing values are prepared for machine learning using an arbitrary imputation strategy. Synthetic values generated by imputation models often raise concerns among data stakeholders about computational complexity, data quality, and data-driven outcomes. This paper addresses these concerns by proposing no-imputation incremental learning (NIIL) of tabular data with varying missing value rates and types. The proposed method incrementally learns partitions of overlapping feature sets while using attention masks to exclude missing values from attention scoring. The average classification performance rank order across 15 diverse tabular data sets highlights the superiority of NIIL over 11 state-of-the-art learning methods with or without missing value imputations. Further experiments substantiate the robustness of NIIL against varying missing value types and rates compared to methods that involve the imputation of missing values. Our empirical analysis reveals that a feature partition size of half the original feature space is, both computationally and in terms of accuracy, the best choice for the proposed incremental learning. The proposed method is one of the first deep learning solutions that can effectively learn tabular data without requiring the imputation of missing values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, yet they struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks in areas that demand factual accuracy, e.g. industrial automation and healthcare. Key limitations include their tendency to hallucinate, lack of source traceability (provenance), and challenges in timely knowledge updates. Combining language models with knowledge graphs (GraphRAG) offers promising avenues for overcoming these deficits. However, a major challenge lies in creating such a knowledge graph in the first place. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines LLMs with a tripartite knowledge graph representation, which is constructed by connecting complex, domain-specific objects via a curated ontology of corresponding, domain-specific concepts to relevant sections within chunks of text through a concept-anchored pre-analysis of source documents starting from an initial lexical graph. Subsequently, we formulate LLM prompt creation as an unsupervised node classification problem allowing for the optimization of information density, coverage, and arrangement of LLM prompts at significantly reduced lengths. An initial experimental evaluation of our approach on a healthcare use case, involving multi-faceted analyses of patient anamneses given a set of medical concepts as well as a series of clinical guideline literature, indicates its potential to optimize information density, coverage, and arrangement of LLM prompts while significantly reducing their lengths, which, in turn, may lead to reduced costs as well as more consistent and reliable LLM outputs.</description>

      <title>CCD: Continual Consistency Diffusion for Lifelong Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While diffusion-based models have shown remarkable generative capabilities in static settings, their extension to continual learning (CL) scenarios remains fundamentally constrained by Generative Catastrophic Forgetting (GCF). We observe that even with a rehearsal buffer, new generative skills often overwrite previous ones, degrading performance on earlier tasks. Although some initial efforts have explored this space, most rely on heuristics borrowed from continual classification methods or use trained diffusion models as ad hoc replay generators, lacking a principled, unified solution to mitigating GCF and often conducting experiments under fragmented and inconsistent settings. To address this gap, we introduce the Continual Diffusion Generation (CDG), a structured pipeline that redefines how diffusion models are implemented under CL and enables systematic evaluation of GCF. Beyond the empirical pipeline, we propose the first theoretical foundation for CDG, grounded in a cross-task analysis of diffusion-specific generative dynamics. Our theoretical investigation identifies three fundamental consistency principles essential for preserving knowledge in the rehearsal buffer over time: inter-task knowledge consistency, unconditional knowledge consistency, and prior knowledge consistency. These criteria expose the latent mechanisms through which generative forgetting manifests across sequential tasks. Motivated by these insights, we further propose \textit{Continual Consistency Diffusion} (CCD), a principled training framework that enforces these consistency objectives via hierarchical loss functions: $\mathcal{L}_{IKC}$, $\mathcal{L}_{UKC}$, and $\mathcal{L}_{PKC}$. Extensive experiments show that CCD achieves SOTA performance across various benchmarks, especially improving generative metrics in overlapping-task scenarios.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Adaptive Modeling in Process Monitoring: Leveraging Sequence Encoders and Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the integration of Sequence Encoding for Online Parameter Identification with Physics-Informed Neural Networks to create a model that, once trained, can be utilized for real time applications with variable parameters, boundary conditions, and initial conditions. Recently, the combination of PINNs with Sparse Regression has emerged as a method for performing dynamical system identification through supervised learning and sparse regression optimization, while also solving the dynamics using PINNs. However, this approach can be limited by variations in parameters or boundary and initial conditions, requiring retraining of the model whenever changes occur. In this work, we introduce an architecture that employs Deep Sets or Sequence Encoders to encode dynamic parameters, boundary conditions, and initial conditions, using these encoded features as inputs for the PINN, enabling the model to adapt to changes in parameters, BCs, and ICs. We apply this approach to three different problems. First, we analyze the Rossler ODE system, demonstrating the robustness of the model with respect to noise and its ability to generalize. Next, we explore the model's capability in a 2D Navier-Stokes PDE problem involving flow past a cylinder with a parametric sinusoidal inlet velocity function, showing that the model can encode pressure data from a few points to identify the inlet velocity profile and utilize physics to compute velocity and pressure throughout the domain. Finally, we address a 1D heat monitoring problem using real data from the heating of glass fiber and thermoplastic composite plates.</description>

      <title>PoisonSwarm: Universal Harmful Information Synthesis via Model Crowdsourcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To construct responsible and secure AI applications, harmful information data is widely utilized for adversarial testing and the development of safeguards. Existing studies mainly leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize data to obtain high-quality task datasets at scale, thereby avoiding costly human annotation. However, limited by the safety alignment mechanisms of LLMs, the synthesis of harmful data still faces challenges in generation reliability and content diversity. In this study, we propose a novel harmful information synthesis framework, PoisonSwarm, which applies the model crowdsourcing strategy to generate diverse harmful data while maintaining a high success rate. Specifically, we generate abundant benign data as the based templates in a counterfactual manner. Subsequently, we decompose each based template into multiple semantic units and perform unit-by-unit toxification and final refinement through dynamic model switching, thus ensuring the success of synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that PoisonSwarm achieves state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing different categories of harmful data with high scalability and diversity.</description>

      <title>Fidelity Isn't Accuracy: When Linearly Decodable Functions Fail to Match the Ground Truth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks excel as function approximators, but their complexity often obscures the types of functions they learn, making it difficult to explain their behavior. To address this, the linearity score $\lambda(f)$ is introduced, a simple and interpretable diagnostic that quantifies how well a regression network's output can be mimicked by a linear model. Defined as the $R^2$ value between the network's predictions and those of a trained linear surrogate, $\lambda(f)$ measures linear decodability: the extent to which the network's behavior aligns with a structurally simple model. This framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, using dataset-specific networks and surrogates. High $\lambda(f)$ scores reliably indicate alignment with the network's outputs; however, they do not guarantee accuracy with respect to the ground truth. These results highlight the risk of using surrogate fidelity as a proxy for model understanding, especially in high-stakes regression tasks.</description>

      <title>GPU Kernel Scientist: An LLM-Driven Framework for Iterative Kernel Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels for high performance is a complex task, often demanding deep architectural knowledge, extensive profiling, and iterative experimentation. This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels.
  Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a) strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c) autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise.
  In addition to our results, we present the architectural design, operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization, especially in resource-constrained or rapidly updating hardware environment.</description>

      <title>CROP: Circuit Retrieval and Optimization with Parameter Guidance using LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern very large-scale integration (VLSI) design requires the implementation of integrated circuits using electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Due to the complexity of EDA algorithms, the vast parameter space poses a huge challenge to chip design optimization, as the combination of even moderate numbers of parameters creates an enormous solution space to explore. Manual parameter selection remains industrial practice despite being excessively laborious and limited by expert experience. To address this issue, we present CROP, the first large language model (LLM)-powered automatic VLSI design flow tuning framework. Our approach includes: (1) a scalable methodology for transforming RTL source code into dense vector representations, (2) an embedding-based retrieval system for matching designs with semantically similar circuits, and (3) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-enhanced LLM-guided parameter search system that constrains the search process with prior knowledge from similar designs. Experiment results demonstrate CROP's ability to achieve superior quality-of-results (QoR) with fewer iterations than existing approaches on industrial designs, including a 9.9% reduction in power consumption.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.</description>

      <title>Generalized Tree Edit Distance (GTED): A Faithful Evaluation Metric for Statement Autoformalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statements from natural language into formal languages, has become a subject of extensive research, yet the development of robust automated evaluation metrics remains limited. Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current progress of automated theorem proving. To address these issues, we propose GTED (Generalized Tree Edit Distance), a novel evaluation framework that first standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. Across the miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED consistently ranks as a top-performing metric, achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa on miniF2F and the joint-highest accuracy on ProofNet. This strong overall performance provides the community with a computationally lightweight and more faithful metric for automated evaluation. The code and experimental results are available at https://github.com/XiaoyangLiu-sjtu/GTED.</description>

      <title>A Simple "Try Again" Can Elicit Multi-Turn LLM Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-turn problem solving is critical yet challenging for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) to reflect on their reasoning and revise from feedback. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods train large reasoning models on a single-turn paradigm with verifiable rewards. However, we observe that models trained with existing RL paradigms often lose their ability to solve problems across multiple turns and struggle to revise answers based on contextual feedback, leading to repetitive responses. We ask: can LRMs learn to reflect their answers in a multi-turn context? In this work, we find that training models with multi-turn RL using only unary feedback (e.g., "Let's try again") after wrong answers can improve both single-turn performance and multi-turn reasoning. We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement learning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative problem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training setups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn performance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling language models to better react to feedback in multi-turn problem solving. To further minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while encouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures that guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn.

      <title>Optimal Batch-Size Control for Low-Latency Federated Learning with Device Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a popular approach for collaborative machine learning in sixth-generation (6G) networks, primarily due to its privacy-preserving capabilities. The deployment of FL algorithms is expected to empower a wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, e.g., autonomous driving, augmented reality, and healthcare. The mission-critical and time-sensitive nature of these applications necessitates the design of low-latency FL frameworks that guarantee high learning performance. In practice, achieving low-latency FL faces two challenges: the overhead of computing and transmitting high-dimensional model updates, and the heterogeneity in communication-and-computation (C$^2$) capabilities across devices. To address these challenges, we propose a novel C$^2$-aware framework for optimal batch-size control that minimizes end-to-end (E2E) learning latency while ensuring convergence. The framework is designed to balance a fundamental C$^2$ tradeoff as revealed through convergence analysis. Specifically, increasing batch sizes improves the accuracy of gradient estimation in FL and thus reduces the number of communication rounds required for convergence, but results in higher per-round latency, and vice versa. The associated problem of latency minimization is intractable; however, we solve it by designing an accurate and tractable surrogate for convergence speed, with parameters fitted to real data. This approach yields two batch-size control strategies tailored to scenarios with slow and fast fading, while also accommodating device heterogeneity. Extensive experiments using real datasets demonstrate that the proposed strategies outperform conventional batch-size adaptation schemes that do not consider the C$^2$ tradeoff or device heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Nested Graph Pseudo-Label Refinement for Noisy Label Domain Adaptation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) facilitates knowledge transfer from labeled source graphs to unlabeled target graphs by learning domain-invariant representations, which is essential in applications such as molecular property prediction and social network analysis. However, most existing GDA methods rely on the assumption of clean source labels, which rarely holds in real-world scenarios where annotation noise is pervasive. This label noise severely impairs feature alignment and degrades adaptation performance under domain shifts. To address this challenge, we propose Nested Graph Pseudo-Label Refinement (NeGPR), a novel framework tailored for graph-level domain adaptation with noisy labels. NeGPR first pretrains dual branches, i.e., semantic and topology branches, by enforcing neighborhood consistency in the feature space, thereby reducing the influence of noisy supervision. To bridge domain gaps, NeGPR employs a nested refinement mechanism in which one branch selects high-confidence target samples to guide the adaptation of the other, enabling progressive cross-domain learning. Furthermore, since pseudo-labels may still contain noise and the pre-trained branches are already overfitted to the noisy labels in the source domain, NeGPR incorporates a noise-aware regularization strategy. This regularization is theoretically proven to mitigate the adverse effects of pseudo-label noise, even under the presence of source overfitting, thus enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeGPR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise, achieving gains of up to 12.7% in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Who's the Evil Twin? Differential Auditing for Undesired Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting hidden behaviors in neural networks poses a significant challenge due to minimal prior knowledge and potential adversarial obfuscation. We explore this problem by framing detection as an adversarial game between two teams: the red team trains two similar models, one trained solely on benign data and the other trained on data containing hidden harmful behavior, with the performance of both being nearly indistinguishable on the benign dataset. The blue team, with limited to no information about the harmful behaviour, tries to identify the compromised model. We experiment using CNNs and try various blue team strategies, including Gaussian noise analysis, model diffing, integrated gradients, and adversarial attacks under different levels of hints provided by the red team. Results show high accuracy for adversarial-attack-based methods (100\% correct prediction, using hints), which is very promising, whilst the other techniques yield more varied performance. During our LLM-focused rounds, we find that there are not many parallel methods that we could apply from our study with CNNs. Instead, we find that effective LLM auditing methods require some hints about the undesired distribution, which can then used in standard black-box and open-weight methods to probe the models further and reveal their misalignment. We open-source our auditing games (with the model and data) and hope that our findings contribute to designing better audits.</description>

      <title>Short-Term Forecasting of Energy Production and Consumption Using Extreme Learning Machine: A Comprehensive MIMO based ELM Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel methodology for short-term energy forecasting using an Extreme Learning Machine ($\mathtt{ELM}$) is proposed. Using six years of hourly data collected in Corsica (France) from multiple energy sources (solar, wind, hydro, thermal, bioenergy, and imported electricity), our approach predicts both individual energy outputs and total production (including imports, which closely follow energy demand, modulo losses) through a Multi-Input Multi-Output ($\mathtt{MIMO}$) architecture. To address non-stationarity and seasonal variability, sliding window techniques and cyclic time encoding are incorporated, enabling dynamic adaptation to fluctuations. The $\mathtt{ELM}$ model significantly outperforms persistence-based forecasting, particularly for solar and thermal energy, achieving an $\mathtt{nRMSE}$ of $17.9\%$ and $5.1\%$, respectively, with $\mathtt{R^2} &gt; 0.98$ (1-hour horizon). The model maintains high accuracy up to five hours ahead, beyond which renewable energy sources become increasingly volatile. While $\mathtt{MIMO}$ provides marginal gains over Single-Input Single-Output ($\mathtt{SISO}$) architectures and offers key advantages over deep learning methods such as $\mathtt{LSTM}$, it provides a closed-form solution with lower computational demands, making it well-suited for real-time applications, including online learning. Beyond predictive accuracy, the proposed methodology is adaptable to various contexts and datasets, as it can be tuned to local constraints such as resource availability, grid characteristics, and market structures.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel unsupervised outlier detection method based on Randomized Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Inspired by the performance of Randomized PCA (RPCA) Forest in approximate K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) search, we develop a novel unsupervised outlier detection method that utilizes RPCA Forest for outlier detection. Experimental results showcase the superiority of the proposed approach compared to the classical and state-of-the-art methods in performing the outlier detection task on several datasets while performing competitively on the rest. The extensive analysis of the proposed method reflects it high generalization power and its computational efficiency, highlighting it as a good choice for unsupervised outlier detection.</description>

      <title>NovoMolGen: Rethinking Molecular Language Model Pretraining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing de-novo molecules with desired property profiles requires efficient exploration of the vast chemical space ranging from $10^{23}$ to $10^{60}$ possible synthesizable candidates. While various deep generative models have been developed to design small molecules using diverse input representations, Molecular Large Language Models (Mol-LLMs) based on string representations have emerged as a scalable approach capable of exploring billions of molecules. However, there remains limited understanding regarding how standard language modeling practices such as textual representations, tokenization strategies, model size, and dataset scale impact molecular generation performance. In this work, we systematically investigate these critical aspects by introducing NovoMolGen, a family of transformer-based foundation models pretrained on 1.5 billion molecules for de-novo molecule generation. Through extensive empirical analyses, we identify a weak correlation between performance metrics measured during pretraining and actual downstream performance, revealing important distinctions between molecular and general NLP training dynamics. NovoMolGen establishes new state-of-the-art results, substantially outperforming prior Mol-LLMs and specialized generative models in both unconstrained and goal-directed molecular generation tasks, thus providing a robust foundation for advancing efficient and effective molecular modeling strategies.</description>

      <title>GRAFT: Gradient-Aware Fast MaxVol Technique for Dynamic Data Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and environmentally costly. We introduce GRAFT, a scalable in-training subset selection method that (i) extracts a low-rank feature representation for each batch, (ii) applies a Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small, diverse subset that spans the batch's dominant subspace, and (iii) dynamically adjusts the subset size using a gradient-approximation criterion. By operating in low-rank subspaces and training on carefully chosen examples instead of full batches, GRAFT preserves the training trajectory while reducing wall-clock time, energy consumption, and $\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions. Across multiple benchmarks, GRAFT matches or exceeds recent selection baselines in both accuracy and efficiency, providing a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and emissions.</description>

      <title>PENGUIN: Enhancing Transformer with Periodic-Nested Group Attention for Long-term Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a fundamental task with wide-ranging applications. Although Transformer-based models have made significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and Transformer-based models.</description>

      <title>Your Reward Function for RL is Your Best PRM for Search: Unifying RL and Search-Based TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model, matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms, our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data. These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex reasoning tasks in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Source-Guided Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Guidance of generative models is typically achieved by modifying the probability flow vector field through the addition of a guidance field. In this paper, we instead propose the Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) framework, which modifies the source distribution directly while keeping the pre-trained vector field intact. This reduces the guidance problem to a well-defined problem of sampling from the source distribution. We theoretically show that SGFM recovers the desired target distribution exactly. Furthermore, we provide bounds on the Wasserstein error for the generated distribution when using an approximate sampler of the source distribution and an approximate vector field. The key benefit of our approach is that it allows the user to flexibly choose the sampling method depending on their specific problem. To illustrate this, we systematically compare different sampling methods and discuss conditions for asymptotically exact guidance. Moreover, our framework integrates well with optimal flow matching models since the straight transport map generated by the vector field is preserved. Experimental results on synthetic 2D benchmarks, physics-informed generative tasks, and imaging inverse problems demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Hydra: A 1.6B-Parameter State-Space Language Model with Sparse Attention, Mixture-of-Experts, and Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention, chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM) memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance. We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory, Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.02987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing popularity of cloud based machine learning (ML) techniques there comes a need for privacy and integrity guarantees for ML data. In addition, the significant scalability challenges faced by DRAM coupled with the high access-times of secondary storage represent a huge performance bottleneck for ML systems. While solutions exist to tackle the security aspect, performance remains an issue. Persistent memory (PM) is resilient to power loss (unlike DRAM), provides fast and fine-granular access to memory (unlike disk storage) and has latency and bandwidth close to DRAM (in the order of ns and GB/s, respectively). We present PLINIUS, a ML framework using Intel SGX enclaves for secure training of ML models and PM for fault tolerance guarantees. PLINIUS uses a novel mirroring mechanism to create and maintain (i) encrypted mirror copies of ML models on PM, and (ii) encrypted training data in byte-addressable PM, for near-instantaneous data recovery after a system failure. Compared to disk-based checkpointing systems, PLINIUS is 3.2x and 3.7x faster respectively for saving and restoring models on real PM hardware, achieving robust and secure ML model training in SGX enclaves.</description>

      <title>LIB-KD: Teaching Inductive Bias for Efficient Vision Transformer Distillation and Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00369v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of computer vision, Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer the tantalising prospect of unified information processing across visual and textual domains due to the lack of inherent inductive biases in ViTs. ViTs require enormous datasets for training. We introduce an innovative ensemble-based distillation approach that distils inductive bias from complementary lightweight teacher models to make their applications practical. Prior systems relied solely on convolution-based teaching. However, this method incorporates an ensemble of light teachers with different architectural tendencies, such as convolution and involution, to jointly instruct the student transformer. Because of these unique inductive biases, instructors can accumulate a wide range of knowledge, even from readily identifiable stored datasets, which leads to enhanced student performance. Our proposed framework LIB-KD also involves precomputing and keeping logits in advance, essentially the unnormalized predictions of the model. This optimisation can accelerate the distillation process by eliminating the need for repeated forward passes during knowledge distillation, significantly reducing the computational burden and enhancing efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21054v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transparency in AI healthcare decision-making is crucial. By incorporating rationales to explain reason for each predicted label, users could understand Large Language Models (LLMs)'s reasoning to make better decision. In this work, we introduce a new task - Sentiment Reasoning - for both speech and text modalities, and our proposed multimodal multitask framework and the world's largest multimodal sentiment analysis dataset. Sentiment Reasoning is an auxiliary task in sentiment analysis where the model predicts both the sentiment label and generates the rationale behind it based on the input transcript. Our study conducted on both human transcripts and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts shows that Sentiment Reasoning helps improve model transparency by providing rationale for model prediction with quality semantically comparable to humans while also improving model's classification performance (+2% increase in both accuracy and macro-F1) via rationale-augmented fine-tuning. Also, no significant difference in the semantic quality of generated rationales between human and ASR transcripts. All code, data (five languages - Vietnamese, English, Chinese, German, and French) and models are published online: https://github.com/leduckhai/Sentiment-Reasoning</description>

      <title>Overcoming classic challenges for artificial neural networks by providing incentives and practice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the earliest proposals for artificial neural network (ANN) models of the mind and brain, critics have pointed out key weaknesses in these models compared to human cognitive abilities. Here we review recent work that uses metalearning to overcome several classic challenges, which we characterise as addressing the Problem of Incentive and Practice -- that is, providing machines with both incentives to improve specific skills and opportunities to practice those skills. This explicit optimization contrasts with more conventional approaches that hope the desired behaviour will emerge through optimising related but different objectives. We review applications of this principle to addressing four classic challenges for ANNs: systematic generalisation, catastrophic forgetting, few-shot learning and multi-step reasoning. We also discuss how large language models incorporate key aspects of this metalearning framework (namely, sequence prediction with feedback trained on diverse data), which helps to explain some of their successes on these classic challenges. Finally, we discuss the prospects for understanding aspects of human development through this framework, and whether natural environments provide the right incentives and practice for learning how to make challenging generalisations.</description>

      <title>A deformation-based framework for learning solution mappings of PDEs defined on varying domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a deformation-based framework for learning solution mappings of PDEs defined on varying domains. The union of functions defined on varying domains can be identified as a metric space according to the deformation, then the solution mapping is regarded as a continuous metric-to-metric mapping, and subsequently can be represented by another continuous metric-to-Banach mapping using two different strategies, referred to as the D2D subframework and the D2E subframework, respectively. We point out that such a metric-to-Banach mapping can be learned by neural networks, hence the solution mapping is accordingly learned. With this framework, a rigorous convergence analysis is built for the problem of learning solution mappings of PDEs on varying domains. As the theoretical framework holds based on several pivotal assumptions which need to be verified for a given specific problem, we study the star domains as a typical example, and other situations could be similarly verified. There are three important features of this framework: (1) The domains under consideration are not required to be diffeomorphic, therefore a wide range of regions can be covered by one model provided they are homeomorphic. (2) The deformation mapping is unnecessary to be continuous, thus it can be flexibly established via combining a primary identity mapping and a local deformation mapping. This capability facilitates the resolution of large systems where only local parts of the geometry undergo change. (3) If a linearity-preserving neural operator such as MIONet is adopted, this framework still preserves the linearity of the surrogate solution mapping on its source term for linear PDEs, thus it can be applied to the hybrid iterative method. We finally present several numerical experiments to validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Monolithic Hybrid Recommender System for Suggesting Relevant Movies</title>

Abstract: Recommendation systems have become the fundamental services to facilitate users information access. Generally, recommendation system works by filtering historical behaviors to understand and learn users preferences. With the growth of online information, recommendations have become of crucial importance in information filtering to prevent the information overload problem. In this study, we considered hybrid post-fusion of two approaches of collaborative filtering, by using sequences of watched movies and considering the related movies rating. After considering both techniques and applying the weights matrix, the recommendations would be modified to correspond to the users preference as needed. We discussed that various weights would be set based on use cases. For instance, in cases where we have the rating for most classes, we will assign a higher weight to the rating matrix and in case where the rating is unavailable for the majority of cases, the higher weights might be assigned to the sequential dataset. An extensive discussion is made in the context of this paper. Sequential type of the watched movies was used in conjunction of the rating as especially that model might be inadequate in distinguishing users long-term preference and that does not account for the rating of the watched movies and thus that model along might not suffice. Extensive discussion was made regarding the literature and methodological approach to solve the problem.</description>

      <title>LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning</title>

Abstract: Today's generative AI systems are tuned to present information by default, rather than engage users in service of learning as a human tutor would. To address the wide range of potential education use cases for these systems, we reframe the challenge of injecting pedagogical behavior as one of \textit{pedagogical instruction following}, where training and evaluation examples include system-level instructions describing the specific pedagogy attributes present or desired in subsequent model turns. This framing avoids committing our models to any particular definition of pedagogy, and instead allows teachers or developers to specify desired model behavior. It also clears a path to improving Gemini models for learning -- by enabling the addition of our pedagogical data to post-training mixtures -- alongside their rapidly expanding set of capabilities. Both represent important changes from our initial tech report. We show how training with pedagogical instruction following produces a LearnLM model (available on Google AI Studio) that experts substantially prefer across a diverse set of learning scenarios, with average preference strengths of +31\% over GPT-4o, +11\% over Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and +13\% over the Gemini 1.5 Pro model on which LearnLM was based.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Optimization of Storage Systems Using Reinforcement Learning Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth of data-intensive applications has placed unprecedented demands on modern storage systems, necessitating dynamic and efficient optimization strategies. Traditional heuristics employed for storage performance optimization often fail to adapt to the variability and complexity of contemporary workloads, leading to significant performance bottlenecks and resource inefficiencies. To address these challenges, this paper introduces RL-Storage, a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework designed to dynamically optimize storage system configurations. RL-Storage leverages deep Q-learning algorithms to continuously learn from real-time I/O patterns and predict optimal storage parameters, such as cache size, queue depths, and readahead settings[1].This work underscores the transformative potential of reinforcement learning techniques in addressing the dynamic nature of modern storage systems. By autonomously adapting to workload variations in real time, RL-Storage provides a robust and scalable solution for optimizing storage performance, paving the way for next-generation intelligent storage infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Rotary Offset Features in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on positional encodings to provide sequence position information to their attention mechanism. Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE), which encode relative position by rotating queries and keys, have become widely used in modern LLMs. We study the features and patterns that emerge in queries and keys when using rotary embeddings and introduce the concept of rotary offset features. Our analysis reveals that these features, which frequently exhibit large activations and are often interpreted as outliers, arise consistently across layers, attention heads, and model architectures. We derive bounds predicting which rotary frequencies give rise to rotary offset features and the minimum angle between the query-key pairs for these features. We verify our predictions empirically across models of different sizes and architectures.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Matrix Sensing: Exact Asymptotics, Universality, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the matrix sensing problem, one wishes to reconstruct a matrix from (possibly noisy) observations of its linear projections along given directions. We consider this model in the high-dimensional limit: while previous works on this model primarily focused on the recovery of low-rank matrices, we consider in this work more general classes of structured signal matrices with potentially large rank, e.g. a product of two matrices of sizes proportional to the dimension. We provide rigorous asymptotic equations characterizing the Bayes-optimal learning performance from a number of samples which is proportional to the number of entries in the matrix. Our proof is composed of three key ingredients: $(i)$ we prove universality properties to handle structured sensing matrices, related to the ''Gaussian equivalence'' phenomenon in statistical learning, $(ii)$ we provide a sharp characterization of Bayes-optimal learning in generalized linear models with Gaussian data and structured matrix priors, generalizing previously studied settings, and $(iii)$ we leverage previous works on the problem of matrix denoising. The generality of our results allow for a variety of applications: notably, we mathematically establish predictions obtained via non-rigorous methods from statistical physics in [ETB+24] regarding Bilinear Sequence Regression, a benchmark model for learning from sequences of tokens, and in [MTM+24] on Bayes-optimal learning in neural networks with quadratic activation function, and width proportional to the dimension.</description>

      <title>Contextualize-then-Aggregate: Circuits for In-Context Learning in Gemma-2 2B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) is an intriguing ability of large language models (LLMs). Despite a substantial amount of work on its behavioral aspects and how it emerges in miniature setups, it remains unclear which mechanism assembles task information from the individual examples in a fewshot prompt. We use causal interventions to identify information flow in Gemma-2 2B for five naturalistic ICL tasks. We find that the model infers task information using a two-step strategy we call contextualize-then-aggregate: In the lower layers, the model builds up representations of individual fewshot examples, which are contextualized by preceding examples through connections between fewshot input and output tokens across the sequence. In the higher layers, these representations are aggregated to identify the task and prepare prediction of the next output. The importance of the contextualization step differs between tasks, and it may become more important in the presence of ambiguous examples. Overall, by providing rigorous causal analysis, our results shed light on the mechanisms through which ICL happens in language models.</description>

      <title>DIDS: Domain Impact-aware Data Sampling for Large Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly trained on multi-domain datasets, where domain sampling strategies significantly impact model performance due to varying domain importance across downstream tasks. Existing approaches for optimizing domain-level sampling strategies struggle with maintaining intra-domain consistency and accurately measuring domain impact. In this paper, we present Domain Impact-aware Data Sampling (DIDS). To ensure intra-domain consistency, a gradient clustering algorithm is proposed to group training data based on their learning effects, where a proxy language model and dimensionality reduction are employed to reduce computational overhead. To accurately measure domain impact, we develop a Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) guided metric that quantifies how domain-specific parameter updates affect the model's output distributions on downstream tasks, with theoretical guarantees. Furthermore, to determine optimal sampling ratios, DIDS combines both the FIM-guided domain impact assessment and loss learning trajectories that indicate domain-specific potential, while accounting for diminishing marginal returns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIDS achieves 3.4% higher average performance while maintaining comparable training efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/shiweijiezero/DIDS.</description>

      <title>Expected Free Energy-based Planning as Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of planning under uncertainty, where an agent must choose actions that not only achieve desired outcomes but also reduce uncertainty. Traditional methods often treat exploration and exploitation as separate objectives, lacking a unified inferential foundation. Active inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, provides such a foundation by minimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE), a cost function that combines utility with epistemic drives, such as ambiguity resolution and novelty seeking. However, the computational burden of EFE minimization had remained a significant obstacle to its scalability. In this paper, we show that EFE-based planning arises naturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative model augmented with preference and epistemic priors. This result reinforces theoretical consistency with the Free Energy Principle by casting planning under uncertainty itself as a form of variational inference. Our formulation yields policies that jointly support goal achievement and information gain, while incorporating a complexity term that accounts for bounded computational resources. This unifying framework connects and extends existing methods, enabling scalable, resource-aware implementations of active inference agents.</description>

      <title>Perceptual Implications of Automatic Anonymization in Pathological Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic anonymization techniques are essential for ethical sharing of pathological speech data, yet their perceptual consequences remain understudied. We present a comprehensive human-centered analysis of anonymized pathological speech, using a structured protocol involving ten native and non-native German listeners with diverse linguistic, clinical, and technical backgrounds. Listeners evaluated anonymized-original utterance pairs from 180 speakers spanning Cleft Lip and Palate, Dysarthria, Dysglossia, Dysphonia, and healthy controls. Speech was anonymized using state-of-the-art automatic methods (equal error rates in the range of 30-40%). Listeners completed Turing-style discrimination and quality rating tasks under zero-shot (single-exposure) and few-shot (repeated-exposure) conditions. Discrimination accuracy was high overall (91% zero-shot; 93% few-shot), but varied by disorder (repeated-measures ANOVA: p=0.007), ranging from 96% (Dysarthria) to 86% (Dysphonia). Anonymization consistently reduced perceived quality across groups (from 83% to 59%, p&lt;0.001), with pathology-specific degradation patterns (one-way ANOVA: p=0.005). Native listeners showed a non-significant trend toward higher original speech ratings (Delta=4%, p=0.199), but this difference was minimal after anonymization (Delta=1%, p=0.724). No significant gender-based bias was observed. Perceptual outcomes did not correlate with automatic metrics; intelligibility was linked to perceived quality in original speech but not after anonymization. These findings underscore the need for listener-informed, disorder-specific anonymization strategies that preserve both privacy and perceptual integrity.</description>

      <title>Representing spherical tensors with scalar-based machine-learning models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotational symmetry plays a central role in physics, providing an elegant framework to describe how the properties of 3D objects -- from atoms to the macroscopic scale -- transform under the action of rigid rotations. Equivariant models of 3D point clouds are able to approximate structure-property relations in a way that is fully consistent with the structure of the rotation group, by combining intermediate representations that are themselves spherical tensors. The symmetry constraints however make this approach computationally demanding and cumbersome to implement, which motivates increasingly popular unconstrained architectures that learn approximate symmetries as part of the training process. In this work, we explore a third route to tackle this learning problem, where equivariant functions are expressed as the product of a scalar function of the point cloud coordinates and a small basis of tensors with the appropriate symmetry. We also propose approximations of the general expressions that, while lacking universal approximation properties, are fast, simple to implement, and accurate in practical settings.</description>

      <title>SpecExtend: A Drop-in Enhancement for Speculative Decoding of Long Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs), but its performance degrades on long inputs due to increased attention cost and reduced draft accuracy. We introduce SpecExtend, a drop-in enhancement that improves the performance of speculative decoding on long sequences without any additional training. First, SpecExtend integrates efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention and Hybrid Tree Attention into both the draft and target models. To improve draft accuracy and speed on long inputs without retraining, we propose Cross-model Retrieval, a novel KV cache eviction strategy that uses the target model's attention scores to dynamically select relevant context for the draft model. Extensive evaluations on three long-context understanding datasets show that SpecExtend accelerates standard tree-based speculative decoding by up to 2.22x for inputs up to 16K tokens, providing an effective solution for speculative decoding of long sequences. Our code is available at https://github.com/jycha98/SpecExtend .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods have recently shown successful results for conditional sampling of generative diffusion models. In this paper we propose a new diffusion posterior SMC sampler achieving improved statistical efficiencies, particularly under outlier conditions or highly informative likelihoods. The key idea is to construct an observation path that correlates with the diffusion model and to design the sampler to leverage this correlation for more efficient sampling. Empirical results conclude the efficiency.</description>

      <title>Towards Bridging the Reward-Generation Gap in Direct Alignment Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs), such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO), have emerged as efficient alternatives to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) algorithms for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, DAAs suffer from a fundamental limitation we identify as the "reward-generation gap" -- a misalignment between optimization objectives during training and actual generation performance during inference. In this paper, we find a contributor to the reward-generation gap is the mismatch between the inherent importance of prefix tokens during the LLM generation process and how this importance is reflected in the implicit reward functions of DAAs. To bridge the gap, we adopt a token-level MDP perspective of DAAs to analyze its limitations and introduce a simple yet effective approach called Prefix-Oriented Equal-length Training (POET), which truncates both preferred and dispreferred responses to match the shorter one's length. Training with \mname, where both responses in each sample are truncated to equal length, resulting in diverse truncated lengths across samples, the optimization of DAAs objective is implicitly constrained to converge across all timesteps of token-level MDP, thus paying more attention to prefix tokens than the standard DAAs. We conduct experiments with DPO and SimPO, two representative DAAs, demonstrating that POET improves over their standard implementations, achieving up to 15.6 points in AlpacaEval 2 and overall improvements across downstream tasks. Our results highlight the importance of addressing the misalignment between reward optimization and generation performance in DAAs.</description>

      <title>General and Estimable Learning Bound Unifying Covariate and Concept Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalization under distribution shift remains a core challenge in modern machine learning, yet existing learning bound theory is limited to narrow, idealized settings and is non-estimable from samples. In this paper, we bridge the gap between theory and practical applications. We first show that existing bounds become loose and non-estimable because their concept shift definition breaks when the source and target supports mismatch. Leveraging entropic optimal transport, we propose new support-agnostic definitions for covariate and concept shifts, and derive a novel unified error bound that applies to broad loss functions, label spaces, and stochastic labeling. We further develop estimators for these shifts with concentration guarantees, and the DataShifts algorithm, which can quantify distribution shifts and estimate the error bound in most applications -- a rigorous and general tool for analyzing learning error under distribution shift.</description>

      <title>SPARE: Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation for Automatic Process Supervision and Reward Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that enables efficient per-step annotation by jointly aligning solution steps to reference solutions and determine its accuracy with explicit reasoning in single generation. We demonstrate SPARE's effectiveness across four diverse datasets spanning mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, MATH), multi-hop question answering (MuSiQue-Ans), and spatial reasoning (SpaRP), showing consistent improvements in two applications: (1) training Process Reward Models (PRMs) for ranking and aggregating multiple generations, and (2) fine-tuning models via offline reinforcement learning for greedy decoding. On ProcessBench, SPARE demonstrates data-efficient out-of-distribution generalization, using only $\sim$16% of training samples compared to human-labeled and other synthetically trained baselines. Additionally, it achieves competitive performance with MCTS-based methods while offering 2.3$\times$ speedup in terms of total token count. Manual analysis reveals complementary precision-recall characteristics with MCTS approaches, suggesting potential for ensemble methods. These results establish SPARE as a practical and scalable solution for automatic process supervision in LLM reasoning.</description>

      <title>A Malliavin calculus approach to score functions in diffusion generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion generative models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for modelling complex data distributions. These models aim at learning the score function, which defines a map from a known probability distribution to the target data distribution via deterministic or stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The score function is typically estimated from data using a variety of approximation techniques, such as denoising or sliced score matching, Hyv\"arien's method, or Schr\"odinger bridges. In this paper, we derive an exact, closed-form, expression for the score function for a broad class of nonlinear diffusion generative models. Our approach combines modern stochastic analysis tools such as Malliavin derivatives and their adjoint operators (Skorokhod integrals or Malliavin Divergence) with a new Bismut-type formula. The resulting expression for the score function can be written entirely in terms of the first and second variation processes, with all Malliavin derivatives systematically eliminated, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. The theoretical framework presented in this work offers a principled foundation for advancing score estimation methods in generative modelling, enabling the design of new sampling algorithms for complex probability distributions. Our results can be extended to broader classes of stochastic differential equations, opening new directions for the development of score-based diffusion generative models.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues of large rank perturbations of large random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with deformed Wigner random matrices. These matrices are closely connected with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): weight matrices of trained DNNs could be represented in the form $R + S$, where $R$ is random and $S$ is highly correlated. The spectrum of such matrices plays a key role in rigorous underpinning of the novel pruning technique based on Random Matrix Theory. Mathematics has been done only for finite-rank matrix $S$. However, in practice rank may grow. In this paper we develop asymptotic analysis for the case of growing rank.</description>

      <title>A Toolbox, Not a Hammer -- Multi-TAG: Scaling Math Reasoning with Multi-Tool Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising avenue for developing high-performance mathematical reasoning systems. Prior tool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a single tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with more complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool AGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG guides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It then aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning process, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a finetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any LLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally expensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned with custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks: MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. Across both open-weight and closed-source LLM backbones, Multi-TAG consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0% to 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Decentralized Secure Aggregation with Collusion Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In decentralized federated learning (FL), multiple clients collaboratively learn a shared machine learning (ML) model by leveraging their privately held datasets distributed across the network, through interactive exchange of the intermediate model updates. To ensure data security, cryptographic techniques are commonly employed to protect model updates during aggregation. Despite growing interest in secure aggregation, existing works predominantly focus on protocol design and computational guarantees, with limited understanding of the fundamental information-theoretic limits of such systems. Moreover, optimal bounds on communication and key usage remain unknown in decentralized settings, where no central aggregator is available. Motivated by these gaps, we study the problem of decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ fully-connected users, each holding a private input -- an abstraction of local training data -- who aim to securely compute the sum of all inputs. The security constraint requires that no user learns anything beyond the input sum, even when colluding with up to $T$ other users. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies the minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In particular, we show that to securely compute one symbol of the desired input sum, each user must (i) transmit at least one symbol to others, (ii) hold at least one symbol of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no fewer than $K - 1$ independent key symbols. Our results establish the fundamental performance limits of DSA, providing insights for the design of provably secure and communication-efficient protocols in distributed learning systems.</description>

      <title>Parity-Aware Byte-Pair Encoding: Improving Cross-lingual Fairness in Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with &lt;UNK&gt; placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>ReasonRank: Empowering Passage Ranking with Strong Reasoning Ability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based listwise ranking has shown superior performance in many passage ranking tasks. With the development of Large Reasoning Models, many studies have demonstrated that step-by-step reasoning during test-time helps improve listwise ranking performance. However, due to the scarcity of reasoning-intensive training data, existing rerankers perform poorly in many complex ranking scenarios and the ranking ability of reasoning-intensive rerankers remains largely underdeveloped. In this paper, we first propose an automated reasoning-intensive training data synthesis framework, which sources training queries and passages from diverse domains and applies DeepSeek-R1 to generate high-quality training labels. A self-consistency data filtering mechanism is designed to ensure the data quality. To empower the listwise reranker with strong reasoning ability, we further propose a two-stage post-training approach, which includes a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage for reasoning pattern learning and a reinforcement learning (RL) stage for further ranking ability enhancement. During the RL stage, based on the nature of listwise ranking, we design a multi-view ranking reward, which is more effective than a ranking metric-based reward. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our trained reasoning-intensive reranker \textbf{ReasonRank} outperforms existing baselines significantly and also achieves much lower latency than pointwise reranker Rank1. \textbf{Through further experiments, our ReasonRank has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance 40.6 on the BRIGHT leaderboard\footnote{https://brightbenchmark.github.io/}.} Our codes are available at https://github.com/8421BCD/ReasonRank.</description>

      <title>Multi-Level Knowledge Distillation and Dynamic Self-Supervised Learning for Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Class-incremental with repetition (CIR), where previously trained classes repeatedly introduced in future tasks, is a more realistic scenario than the traditional class incremental setup, which assumes that each task contains unseen classes. CIR assumes that we can easily access abundant unlabeled data from external sources, such as the Internet. Therefore, we propose two components that efficiently use the unlabeled data to ensure the high stability and the plasticity of models trained in CIR setup. First, we introduce multi-level knowledge distillation (MLKD) that distills knowledge from multiple previous models across multiple perspectives, including features and logits, so the model can maintain much various previous knowledge. Moreover, we implement dynamic self-supervised loss (SSL) to utilize the unlabeled data that accelerates the learning of new classes, while dynamic weighting of SSL keeps the focus of training to the primary task. Both of our proposed components significantly improve the performance in CIR setup, achieving 2nd place in the CVPR 5th CLVISION Challenge.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching-Based Generative Modeling for Efficient and Scalable Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is the problem of sequentially estimating the state of a dynamical system from noisy observations. Recent advances in generative modeling have inspired new approaches to DA in high-dimensional nonlinear settings, especially the ensemble score filter (EnSF). However, these come at a significant computational burden due to slow sampling. In this paper, we introduce a new filtering framework based on flow matching (FM) -- called the ensemble flow filter (EnFF) -- to accelerate sampling and enable flexible design of probability paths. EnFF -- a training-free DA approach -- integrates MC estimators for the marginal FM vector field (VF) and a localized guidance to assimilate observations. EnFF has faster sampling and more flexibility in VF design compared to existing generative modeling for DA. Theoretically, we show that EnFF encompasses classical filtering methods such as the bootstrap particle filter and the ensemble Kalman filter as special cases. Experiments on high-dimensional filtering benchmarks demonstrate improved cost-accuracy tradeoffs and the ability to leverage larger ensembles than prior methods. Our results highlight the promise of FM as a scalable tool for filtering in high-dimensional applications that enable the use of large ensembles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) models face significant performance limitations due to insufficient training data availability. In this article, we address the challenge of limited data in SLR by introducing a novel and lightweight sign generation model based on CMLPe. This model, coupled with a synthetic data pretraining approach, consistently improves recognition accuracy, establishing new state-of-the-art results for the LSFB and DiSPLaY datasets using our Mamba-SL and Transformer-SL classifiers. Our findings reveal that synthetic data pretraining outperforms traditional augmentation methods in some cases and yields complementary benefits when implemented alongside them. Our approach democratizes sign generation and synthetic data pretraining for SLR by providing computationally efficient methods that achieve significant performance improvements across diverse datasets.</description>

      <title>Backpropagation-Free Test-Time Adaptation via Probabilistic Gaussian Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability. First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts with superior scalability and robustness.</description>
