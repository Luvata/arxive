      <title>Impact of Inaccurate Contamination Ratio on Robust Unsupervised Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training data sets intended for unsupervised anomaly detection, typically presumed to be anomaly-free, often contain anomalies (or contamination), a challenge that significantly undermines model performance. Most robust unsupervised anomaly detection models rely on contamination ratio information to tackle contamination. However, in reality, contamination ratio may be inaccurate. We investigate on the impact of inaccurate contamination ratio information in robust unsupervised anomaly detection. We verify whether they are resilient to misinformed contamination ratios. Our investigation on 6 benchmark data sets reveals that such models are not adversely affected by exposure to misinformation. In fact, they can exhibit improved performance when provided with such inaccurate contamination ratios.</description>

      <title>Operator Feature Neural Network for Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic regression is a task aimed at identifying patterns in data and representing them through mathematical expressions, generally involving skeleton prediction and constant optimization. Many methods have achieved some success, however they treat variables and symbols merely as characters of natural language without considering their mathematical essence. This paper introduces the operator feature neural network (OF-Net) which employs operator representation for expressions and proposes an implicit feature encoding method for the intrinsic mathematical operational logic of operators. By substituting operator features for numeric loss, we can predict the combination of operators of target expressions. We evaluate the model on public datasets, and the results demonstrate that the model achieves superior recovery rates and high $R^2$ scores. With the discussion of the results, we analyze the merit and demerit of OF-Net and propose optimizing schemes.</description>

      <title>"Normalized Stress" is Not Normalized: How to Interpret Stress Correctly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stress is among the most commonly employed quality metrics and optimization criteria for dimension reduction projections of high dimensional data. Complex, high dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific disciplines, including machine learning, biology, and the social sciences. One of the primary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two dimensional scatter plots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers often use quality metrics to measure projection accuracy or faithfulness to the full data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling of the projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the projection. We investigate the effect of scaling on stress and other distance based quality metrics analytically and empirically by showing just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to make normalized stress scale invariant and show that it accurately captures expected behavior on a small benchmark.</description>

      <title>Graph neural network surrogate for strategic transport planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the complexities of urban environments continue to grow, the modelling of transportation systems become increasingly challenging. This paper explores the application of advanced Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures as surrogate models for strategic transport planning. Building upon a prior work that laid the foundation with graph convolution networks (GCN), our study delves into the comparative analysis of established GCN with the more expressive Graph Attention Network (GAT). Additionally, we propose a novel GAT variant (namely GATv3) to address over-smoothing issues in graph-based models. Our investigation also includes the exploration of a hybrid model combining both GCN and GAT architectures, aiming to investigate the performance of the mixture. The three models are applied to various experiments to understand their limits. We analyse hierarchical regression setups, combining classification and regression tasks, and introduce fine-grained classification with a proposal of a method to convert outputs to precise values. Results reveal the superior performance of the new GAT in classification tasks. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first GAT model in literature to achieve larger depths. Surprisingly, the fine-grained classification task demonstrates the GCN's unexpected dominance with additional training data. This shows that synthetic data generators can increase the training data, without overfitting issues whilst improving model performance. In conclusion, this research advances GNN based surrogate modelling, providing insights for refining GNN architectures. The findings open avenues for investigating the potential of the newly proposed GAT architecture and the modelling setups for other transportation problems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Adversarial Attacks via Parameter Adaptive Adversarial Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent times, the swift evolution of adversarial attacks has captured widespread attention, particularly concerning their transferability and other performance attributes. These techniques are primarily executed at the sample level, frequently overlooking the intrinsic parameters of models. Such neglect suggests that the perturbations introduced in adversarial samples might have the potential for further reduction. Given the essence of adversarial attacks is to impair model integrity with minimal noise on original samples, exploring avenues to maximize the utility of such perturbations is imperative. Against this backdrop, we have delved into the complexities of adversarial attack algorithms, dissecting the adversarial process into two critical phases: the Directional Supervision Process (DSP) and the Directional Optimization Process (DOP). While DSP determines the direction of updates based on the current samples and model parameters, it has been observed that existing model parameters may not always be conducive to adversarial attacks. The impact of models on adversarial efficacy is often overlooked in current research, leading to the neglect of DSP. We propose that under certain conditions, fine-tuning model parameters can significantly enhance the quality of DSP. For the first time, we propose that under certain conditions, fine-tuning model parameters can significantly improve the quality of the DSP. We provide, for the first time, rigorous mathematical definitions and proofs for these conditions, and introduce multiple methods for fine-tuning model parameters within DSP. Our extensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed P3A method. Our code is accessible at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/P3A-A12C/</description>

      <title>Enhancing Model Interpretability with Local Attribution over Global Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of artificial intelligence, AI models are frequently described as `black boxes' due to the obscurity of their internal mechanisms. It has ignited research interest on model interpretability, especially in attribution methods that offers precise explanations of model decisions. Current attribution algorithms typically evaluate the importance of each parameter by exploring the sample space. A large number of intermediate states are introduced during the exploration process, which may reach the model's Out-of-Distribution (OOD) space. Such intermediate states will impact the attribution results, making it challenging to grasp the relative importance of features. In this paper, we firstly define the local space and its relevant properties, and we propose the Local Attribution (LA) algorithm that leverages these properties. The LA algorithm comprises both targeted and untargeted exploration phases, which are designed to effectively generate intermediate states for attribution that thoroughly encompass the local space. Compared to the state-of-the-art attribution methods, our approach achieves an average improvement of 38.21\% in attribution effectiveness. Extensive ablation studies in our experiments also validate the significance of each component in our algorithm. Our code is available at: https://github.com/LMBTough/LA/</description>

      <title>How to Solve Contextual Goal-Oriented Problems with Offline Datasets?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method, Contextual goal-Oriented Data Augmentation (CODA), which uses commonly available unlabeled trajectories and context-goal pairs to solve Contextual Goal-Oriented (CGO) problems. By carefully constructing an action-augmented MDP that is equivalent to the original MDP, CODA creates a fully labeled transition dataset under training contexts without additional approximation error. We conduct a novel theoretical analysis to demonstrate CODA's capability to solve CGO problems in the offline data setup. Empirical results also showcase the effectiveness of CODA, which outperforms other baseline methods across various context-goal relationships of CGO problem. This approach offers a promising direction to solving CGO problems using offline datasets.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Distribution Learning with Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) learning often relies heavily on statistical approaches or predefined assumptions about OOD data distributions, hindering their efficacy in addressing multifaceted challenges of OOD generalization and OOD detection in real-world deployment environments. This paper presents a novel framework for OOD learning with human feedback, which can provide invaluable insights into the nature of OOD shifts and guide effective model adaptation. Our framework capitalizes on the freely available unlabeled data in the wild that captures the environmental test-time OOD distributions under both covariate and semantic shifts. To harness such data, our key idea is to selectively provide human feedback and label a small number of informative samples from the wild data distribution, which are then used to train a multi-class classifier and an OOD detector. By exploiting human feedback, we enhance the robustness and reliability of machine learning models, equipping them with the capability to handle OOD scenarios with greater precision. We provide theoretical insights on the generalization error bounds to justify our algorithm. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method, outperforming the current state-of-the-art by a significant margin.</description>

      <title>MedTsLLM: Leveraging LLMs for Multimodal Medical Time Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity and heterogeneity of data in many real-world applications pose significant challenges for traditional machine learning and signal processing techniques. For instance, in medicine, effective analysis of diverse physiological signals is crucial for patient monitoring and clinical decision-making and yet highly challenging. We introduce MedTsLLM, a general multimodal large language model (LLM) framework that effectively integrates time series data and rich contextual information in the form of text to analyze physiological signals, performing three tasks with clinical relevance: semantic segmentation, boundary detection, and anomaly detection in time series. These critical tasks enable deeper analysis of physiological signals and can provide actionable insights for clinicians. We utilize a reprogramming layer to align embeddings of time series patches with a pretrained LLM's embedding space and make effective use of raw time series, in conjunction with textual context. Given the multivariate nature of medical datasets, we develop methods to handle multiple covariates. We additionally tailor the text prompt to include patient-specific information. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including deep learning models, other LLMs, and clinical methods across multiple medical domains, specifically electrocardiograms and respiratory waveforms. MedTsLLM presents a promising step towards harnessing the power of LLMs for medical time series analysis that can elevate data-driven tools for clinicians and improve patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Kraken: Inherently Parallel Transformers For Efficient Multi-Device Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Transformer networks are increasingly used in settings where low inference latency can improve the end-user experience and enable new applications. However, autoregressive inference is resource intensive and requires parallelism for efficiency. Parallelism introduces collective communication that is both expensive and represents a phase when hardware resources are underutilized. Towards mitigating this, Kraken is an evolution of the standard Transformer architecture that is designed to complement existing tensor parallelism schemes for efficient inference on multi-device systems. By introducing a fixed degree of intra-layer model parallelism, the architecture allows collective operations to be overlapped with compute, decreasing latency and increasing hardware utilization. When trained on OpenWebText, Kraken models reach a similar perplexity as standard Transformers while also preserving their language modeling capabilities when evaluated on the SuperGLUE benchmark. Importantly, when tested on multi-GPU systems using TensorRT-LLM engines, Kraken speeds up Time To First Token by a mean of 35.6% across a range of model sizes, context lengths, and degrees of tensor parallelism.</description>

      <title>Differentiating Policies for Non-Myopic Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) methods choose sample points by optimizing an acquisition function derived from a statistical model of the objective. These acquisition functions are chosen to balance sampling regions with predicted good objective values against exploring regions where the objective is uncertain. Standard acquisition functions are myopic, considering only the impact of the next sample, but non-myopic acquisition functions may be more effective. In principle, one could model the sampling by a Markov decision process, and optimally choose the next sample by maximizing an expected reward computed by dynamic programming; however, this is infeasibly expensive. More practical approaches, such as rollout, consider a parametric family of sampling policies. In this paper, we show how to efficiently estimate rollout acquisition functions and their gradients, enabling stochastic gradient-based optimization of sampling policies.</description>

      <title>SustainDC -- Benchmarking for Sustainable Data Center Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has driven an exponential increase in computational demand, leading to massive data centers that consume significant amounts of energy and contribute to climate change. This makes sustainable data center control a priority. In this paper, we introduce SustainDC, a set of Python environments for benchmarking multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms for data centers (DC). SustainDC supports custom DC configurations and tasks such as workload scheduling, cooling optimization, and auxiliary battery management, with multiple agents managing these operations while accounting for the effects of each other. We evaluate various MARL algorithms on SustainDC, showing their performance across diverse DC designs, locations, weather conditions, grid carbon intensity, and workload requirements. Our results highlight significant opportunities for improvement of data center operations using MARL algorithms. Given the increasing use of DC due to AI, SustainDC provides a crucial platform for the development and benchmarking of advanced algorithms essential for achieving sustainable computing and addressing other heterogeneous real-world challenges.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Equitable Access to AI in Housing and Homelessness System of Care through Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The top priority of a Housing and Homelessness System of Care (HHSC) is to connect people experiencing homelessness to supportive housing. An HHSC typically consists of many agencies serving the same population. Information technology platforms differ in type and quality between agencies, so their data are usually isolated from one agency to another. Larger agencies may have sufficient data to train and test artificial intelligence (AI) tools but smaller agencies typically do not. To address this gap, we introduce a Federated Learning (FL) approach enabling all agencies to train a predictive model collaboratively without sharing their sensitive data. We demonstrate how FL can be used within an HHSC to provide all agencies equitable access to quality AI and further assist human decision-makers in the allocation of resources within HHSC. This is achieved while preserving the privacy of the people within the data by not sharing identifying information between agencies without their consent. Our experimental results using real-world HHSC data from Calgary, Alberta, demonstrate that our FL approach offers comparable performance with the idealized scenario of training the predictive model with data fully shared and linked between agencies.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Evaluation of Generated Time Series and Their Effects in Self-Supervised Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised Pretrained Models (PTMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in computer vision and natural language processing tasks. These successes have prompted researchers to design PTMs for time series data. In our experiments, most self-supervised time series PTMs were surpassed by simple supervised models. We hypothesize this undesired phenomenon may be caused by data scarcity. In response, we test six time series generation methods, use the generated data in pretraining in lieu of the real data, and examine the effects on classification performance. Our results indicate that replacing a real-data pretraining set with a greater volume of only generated samples produces noticeable improvement.</description>

      <title>Incremental Structure Discovery of Classification via Sequential Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) provide a powerful framework for making predictions and understanding uncertainty for classification with kernels and Bayesian non-parametric learning. Building such models typically requires strong prior knowledge to define preselect kernels, which could be ineffective for online applications of classification that sequentially process data because features of data may shift during the process. To alleviate the requirement of prior knowledge used in GPs and learn new features from data that arrive successively, this paper presents a novel method to automatically discover models of classification on complex data with little prior knowledge. Our method adapts a recently proposed technique for GP-based time-series structure discovery, which integrates GPs and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). We extend the technique to handle extra latent variables in GP classification, such that our method can effectively and adaptively learn a-priori unknown structures of classification from continuous input. In addition, our method adapts new batch of data with updated structures of models. Our experiments show that our method is able to automatically incorporate various features of kernels on synthesized data and real-world data for classification. In the experiments of real-world data, our method outperforms various classification methods on both online and offline setting achieving a 10\% accuracy improvement on one benchmark.</description>

      <title>The Nah Bandit: Modeling User Non-compliance in Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommendation systems now pervade the digital world, ranging from advertising to entertainment. However, it remains challenging to implement effective recommendation systems in the physical world, such as in mobility or health. This work focuses on a key challenge: in the physical world, it is often easy for the user to opt out of taking any recommendation if they are not to her liking, and to fall back to her baseline behavior. It is thus crucial in cyber-physical recommendation systems to operate with an interaction model that is aware of such user behavior, lest the user abandon the recommendations altogether. This paper thus introduces the Nah Bandit, a tongue-in-cheek reference to describe a Bandit problem where users can say `nah' to the recommendation and opt for their preferred option instead. As such, this problem lies in between a typical bandit setup and supervised learning. We model the user non-compliance by parameterizing an anchoring effect of recommendations on users. We then propose the Expert with Clustering (EWC) algorithm, a hierarchical approach that incorporates feedback from both recommended and non-recommended options to accelerate user preference learning. In a recommendation scenario with $N$ users, $T$ rounds per user, and $K$ clusters, EWC achieves a regret bound of $O(N\sqrt{T\log K} + NT)$, achieving superior theoretical performance in the short term compared to LinUCB algorithm. Experimental results also highlight that EWC outperforms both supervised learning and traditional contextual bandit approaches. This advancement reveals that effective use of non-compliance feedback can accelerate preference learning and improve recommendation accuracy. This work lays the foundation for future research in Nah Bandit, providing a robust framework for more effective recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>KAN versus MLP on Irregular or Noisy Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compare the performance of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) networks on irregular or noisy functions. We control the number of parameters and the size of the training samples to ensure a fair comparison. For clarity, we categorize the functions into six types: regular functions, continuous functions with local non-differentiable points, functions with jump discontinuities, functions with singularities, functions with coherent oscillations, and noisy functions. Our experimental results indicate that KAN does not always perform best. For some types of functions, MLP outperforms or performs comparably to KAN. Furthermore, increasing the size of training samples can improve performance to some extent. When noise is added to functions, the irregular features are often obscured by the noise, making it challenging for both MLP and KAN to extract these features effectively. We hope these experiments provide valuable insights for future neural network research and encourage further investigations to overcome these challenges.</description>

      <title>CEGRL-TKGR: A Causal Enhanced Graph Representation Learning Framework for Improving Temporal Knowledge Graph Extrapolation Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph reasoning (TKGR) is increasingly gaining attention for its ability to extrapolate new events from historical data, thereby enriching the inherently incomplete temporal knowledge graphs. Existing graph-based representation learning frameworks have made significant strides in developing evolving representations for both entities and relational embeddings. Despite these achievements, there's a notable tendency in these models to inadvertently learn biased data representations and mine spurious correlations, consequently failing to discern the causal relationships between events. This often leads to incorrect predictions based on these false correlations. To address this, we propose an innovative causal enhanced graph representation learning framework for TKGR (named CEGRL-TKGR). This framework introduces causal structures in graph-based representation learning to unveil the essential causal relationships between events, ultimately enhancing task performance. Specifically, we first disentangle the evolutionary representations of entities and relations in a temporal graph sequence into two distinct components, namely causal representations and confounding representations. Then, drawing on causal intervention theory, we advocate the utilization of causal representations for predictions, aiming to mitigate the effects of erroneous correlations caused by confounding features, thus achieving more robust and accurate predictions. Finally, extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model in the link prediction task.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Network for Predicting Out-of-Training-Range TCAD Solution with Minimized Domain Expertise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is promising in assisting technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations to alleviate difficulty in convergence and prolonged simulation time. While ML is widely used in TCAD, they either require access to the internal solver, require extensive domain expertise, are only trained by terminal quantities such as currents and voltages, and/or lack out-of-training-range prediction capability. In this paper, using Si nanowire as an example, we demonstrate that it is possible to use a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to predict out-of-training-range TCAD solutions without accessing the internal solver and with minimal domain expertise. The machine not only can predict a 2.5 times larger range than the training but also can predict the inversion region by only being trained with subthreshold region data. The physics-informed module is also trained with data without the need for human-coded equations making this easier to be extended to more sophisticated systems.</description>

      <title>A Single Channel-Based Neonatal Sleep-Wake Classification using Hjorth Parameters and Improved Gradient Boosting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep plays a crucial role in neonatal development. Monitoring the sleep patterns in neonates in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is imperative for understanding the maturation process. While polysomnography (PSG) is considered the best practice for sleep classification, its expense and reliance on human annotation pose challenges. Existing research often relies on multichannel EEG signals; however, concerns arise regarding the vulnerability of neonates and the potential impact on their sleep quality. This paper introduces a novel approach to neonatal sleep stage classification using a single-channel gradient boosting algorithm with Hjorth features. The gradient boosting parameters are fine-tuned using random search cross-validation (randomsearchCV), achieving an accuracy of 82.35% for neonatal sleep-wake classification. Validation is conducted through 5-fold cross-validation. The proposed algorithm not only enhances existing neonatal sleep algorithms but also opens avenues for broader applications.</description>

      <title>RandomNet: Clustering Time Series Using Untrained Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks are widely used in machine learning and data mining. Typically, these networks need to be trained, implying the adjustment of weights (parameters) within the network based on the input data. In this work, we propose a novel approach, RandomNet, that employs untrained deep neural networks to cluster time series. RandomNet uses different sets of random weights to extract diverse representations of time series and then ensembles the clustering relationships derived from these different representations to build the final clustering results. By extracting diverse representations, our model can effectively handle time series with different characteristics. Since all parameters are randomly generated, no training is required during the process. We provide a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness of the method. To validate its performance, we conduct extensive experiments on all of the 128 datasets in the well-known UCR time series archive and perform statistical analysis of the results. These datasets have different sizes, sequence lengths, and they are from diverse fields. The experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Meta SAC-Lag: Towards Deployable Safe Reinforcement Learning via MetaGradient-based Hyperparameter Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) is one of the prevalently studied subcategories of trial-and-error-based methods with the intention to be deployed on real-world systems. In safe RL, the goal is to maximize reward performance while minimizing constraints, often achieved by setting bounds on constraint functions and utilizing the Lagrangian method. However, deploying Lagrangian-based safe RL in real-world scenarios is challenging due to the necessity of threshold fine-tuning, as imprecise adjustments may lead to suboptimal policy convergence. To mitigate this challenge, we propose a unified Lagrangian-based model-free architecture called Meta Soft Actor-Critic Lagrangian (Meta SAC-Lag). Meta SAC-Lag uses meta-gradient optimization to automatically update the safety-related hyperparameters. The proposed method is designed to address safe exploration and threshold adjustment with minimal hyperparameter tuning requirement. In our pipeline, the inner parameters are updated through the conventional formulation and the hyperparameters are adjusted using the meta-objectives which are defined based on the updated parameters. Our results show that the agent can reliably adjust the safety performance due to the relatively fast convergence rate of the safety threshold. We evaluate the performance of Meta SAC-Lag in five simulated environments against Lagrangian baselines, and the results demonstrate its capability to create synergy between parameters, yielding better or competitive results. Furthermore, we conduct a real-world experiment involving a robotic arm tasked with pouring coffee into a cup without spillage. Meta SAC-Lag is successfully trained to execute the task, while minimizing effort constraints.</description>

      <title>Addressing Skewed Heterogeneity via Federated Prototype Rectification with Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning is an efficient framework designed to facilitate collaborative model training across multiple distributed devices while preserving user data privacy. A significant challenge of federated learning is data-level heterogeneity, i.e., skewed or long-tailed distribution of private data. Although various methods have been proposed to address this challenge, most of them assume that the underlying global data is uniformly distributed across all clients. This paper investigates data-level heterogeneity federated learning with a brief review and redefines a more practical and challenging setting called Skewed Heterogeneous Federated Learning (SHFL). Accordingly, we propose a novel Federated Prototype Rectification with Personalization which consists of two parts: Federated Personalization and Federated Prototype Rectification. The former aims to construct balanced decision boundaries between dominant and minority classes based on private data, while the latter exploits both inter-class discrimination and intra-class consistency to rectify empirical prototypes. Experiments on three popular benchmarks show that the proposed approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and achieves balanced performance in both personalization and generalization.</description>

      <title>Analytical Uncertainty-Based Loss Weighting in Multi-Task Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of neural networks in various domains, multi-task learning (MTL) gained significant relevance. A key challenge in MTL is balancing individual task losses during neural network training to improve performance and efficiency through knowledge sharing across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel task-weighting method by building on the most prevalent approach of Uncertainty Weighting and computing analytically optimal uncertainty-based weights, normalized by a softmax function with tunable temperature. Our approach yields comparable results to the combinatorially prohibitive, brute-force approach of Scalarization while offering a more cost-effective yet high-performing alternative. We conduct an extensive benchmark on various datasets and architectures. Our method consistently outperforms six other common weighting methods. Furthermore, we report noteworthy experimental findings for the practical application of MTL. For example, larger networks diminish the influence of weighting methods, and tuning the weight decay has a low impact compared to the learning rate.</description>

      <title>Experimental evaluation of offline reinforcement learning for HVAC control in buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have been increasingly investigated for dynamic HVAC control in buildings. However, most studies focus on exploring solutions in online or off-policy scenarios without discussing in detail the implementation feasibility or effectiveness of dealing with purely offline datasets or trajectories. The lack of these works limits the real-world deployment of RL-based HVAC controllers, especially considering the abundance of historical data. To this end, this paper comprehensively evaluates the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms by conducting analytical and numerical studies. The analysis is conducted from two perspectives: algorithms and dataset characteristics. As a prerequisite, the necessity of applying offline RL algorithms is first confirmed in two building environments. The ability of observation history modeling to reduce violations and enhance performance is subsequently studied. Next, the performance of RL-based controllers under datasets with different qualitative and quantitative conditions is investigated, including constraint satisfaction and power consumption. Finally, the sensitivity of certain hyperparameters is also evaluated. The results indicate that datasets of a certain suboptimality level and relatively small scale can be utilized to effectively train a well-performed RL-based HVAC controller. Specifically, such controllers can reduce at most 28.5% violation ratios of indoor temperatures and achieve at most 12.1% power savings compared to the baseline controller. In summary, this paper presents our well-structured investigations and new findings when applying offline reinforcement learning to building HVAC systems.</description>

      <title>Inversion-DeepONet: A Novel DeepONet-Based Network with Encoder-Decoder for Full Waveform Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) plays a crucial role in the field of geophysics. There has been lots of research about applying deep learning (DL) methods to FWI. The success of DL-FWI relies significantly on the quantity and diversity of the datasets. Nevertheless, existing FWI datasets, like OpenFWI, where sources have fixed locations or identical frequencies, provide limited information and do not represent the complex real-world scene. For instance, low frequencies help in resolving larger-scale structures. High frequencies allow for a more detailed subsurface features. %A single source frequency is insufficient to describe subsurface structural properties. We consider that simultaneously using sources with different frequencies, instead of performing inversion using low frequencies data and then gradually introducing higher frequencies data, has rationale and potential advantages. Hence, we develop three enhanced datasets based on OpenFWI where each source have varying locations, frequencies or both. Moreover, we propose a novel deep operator network (DeepONet) architecture Inversion-DeepONet for FWI. We utilize convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract the features from seismic data in branch net. Source parameters, such as locations and frequencies, are fed to trunk net. Then another CNN is employed as the decoder of DeepONet to reconstruct the velocity models more effectively. Through experiments, we confirm the superior performance on accuracy and generalization ability of our network, compared with existing data-driven FWI methods.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery from Time-Series Data with Short-Term Invariance-Based Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal discovery from time-series data aims to capture both intra-slice (contemporaneous) and inter-slice (time-lagged) causality between variables within the temporal chain, which is crucial for various scientific disciplines. Compared to causal discovery from non-time-series data, causal discovery from time-series data necessitates more serialized samples with a larger amount of observed time steps. To address the challenges, we propose a novel gradient-based causal discovery approach STIC, which focuses on \textbf{S}hort-\textbf{T}erm \textbf{I}nvariance using \textbf{C}onvolutional neural networks to uncover the causal relationships from time-series data. Specifically, STIC leverages both the short-term time and mechanism invariance of causality within each window observation, which possesses the property of independence, to enhance sample efficiency. Furthermore, we construct two causal convolution kernels, which correspond to the short-term time and mechanism invariance respectively, to estimate the window causal graph. To demonstrate the necessity of convolutional neural networks for causal discovery from time-series data, we theoretically derive the equivalence between convolution and the underlying generative principle of time-series data under the assumption that the additive noise model is identifiable. Experimental evaluations conducted on both synthetic and FMRI benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STIC outperforms baselines significantly and achieves the state-of-the-art performance, particularly when the datasets contain a limited number of observed time steps.

Abstract: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning (RL) platform that enhances end-to-end user journeys in healthcare digital tools through personalization. We explore a case study with SwipeRx, the most popular all-in-one app for pharmacists in Southeast Asia, demonstrating how the platform can be used to personalize and adapt user experiences. Our RL framework is tested through a series of experiments with product recommendations tailored to each pharmacy based on real-time information on their purchasing history and in-app engagement, showing a significant increase in basket size. By integrating adaptive interventions into existing mobile health solutions and enriching user journeys, our platform offers a scalable solution to improve pharmaceutical supply chain management, health worker capacity building, and clinical decision and patient care, ultimately contributing to better healthcare outcomes.</description>

      <title>The Clever Hans Effect in Unsupervised Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised learning has become an essential building block of AI systems. The representations it produces, e.g. in foundation models, are critical to a wide variety of downstream applications. It is therefore important to carefully examine unsupervised models to ensure not only that they produce accurate predictions, but also that these predictions are not "right for the wrong reasons", the so-called Clever Hans (CH) effect. Using specially developed Explainable AI techniques, we show for the first time that CH effects are widespread in unsupervised learning. Our empirical findings are enriched by theoretical insights, which interestingly point to inductive biases in the unsupervised learning machine as a primary source of CH effects. Overall, our work sheds light on unexplored risks associated with practical applications of unsupervised learning and suggests ways to make unsupervised learning more robust.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Continuous Control Perspective for Reinforcement-Learning-based Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation, where user preference is dynamically inferred from sequential historical behaviors, is a critical task in recommender systems (RSs). To further optimize long-term user engagement, offline reinforcement-learning-based RSs have become a mainstream technique as they provide an additional advantage in avoiding global explorations that may harm online users' experiences. However, previous studies mainly focus on discrete action and policy spaces, which might have difficulties in handling dramatically growing items efficiently.
  To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we aim to design an algorithmic framework applicable to continuous policies. To facilitate the control in the low-dimensional but dense user preference space, we propose an \underline{\textbf{E}}fficient \underline{\textbf{Co}}ntinuous \underline{\textbf{C}}ontrol framework (ECoC). Based on a statistically tested assumption, we first propose the novel unified action representation abstracted from normalized user and item spaces. Then, we develop the corresponding policy evaluation and policy improvement procedures. During this process, strategic exploration and directional control in terms of unified actions are carefully designed and crucial to final recommendation decisions. Moreover, beneficial from unified actions, the conservatism regularization for policies and value functions are combined and perfectly compatible with the continuous framework. The resulting dual regularization ensures the successful offline training of RL-based recommendation policies. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our framework. The results show that compared to the discrete baselines, our ECoC is trained far more efficiently. Meanwhile, the final policies outperform baselines in both capturing the offline data and gaining long-term rewards.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observation of the underlying actors that generate event sequences reveals that they often evolve continuously. Most modern methods, however, tend to model such processes through at most piecewise-continuous trajectories. To address this, we adopt a way of viewing events not as standalone phenomena but instead as observations of a Gaussian Process, which in turn governs the actor's dynamics. We propose integrating these obtained dynamics, resulting in a continuous-trajectory modification of the widely successful Neural ODE model. Through Gaussian Process theory, we were able to evaluate the uncertainty in an actor's representation, which arises from not observing them between events. This estimate led us to develop a novel, theoretically backed negative feedback mechanism. Empirical studies indicate that our model with Gaussian process interpolation and negative feedback achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improvements up to 20% AUROC against similar architectures.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) effectively addresses distribution shifts between training and testing data by adjusting models on test samples, which is crucial for improving model inference in real-world applications. However, traditional TTA methods typically follow a fixed pattern to address the dynamic data patterns (low-diversity or high-diversity patterns) often leading to performance degradation and consequently a decline in Quality of Experience (QoE). The primary issues we observed are:Different scenarios require different normalization methods (e.g., Instance Normalization is optimal in mixed domains but not in static domains). Model fine-tuning can potentially harm the model and waste time.Hence, it is crucial to design strategies for effectively measuring and managing distribution diversity to minimize its negative impact on model performance. Based on these observations, this paper proposes a new general method, named Diversity Adaptive Test-Time Adaptation (DATTA), aimed at improving QoE. DATTA dynamically selects the best batch normalization methods and fine-tuning strategies by leveraging the Diversity Score to differentiate between high and low diversity score batches. It features three key components: Diversity Discrimination (DD) to assess batch diversity, Diversity Adaptive Batch Normalization (DABN) to tailor normalization methods based on DD insights, and Diversity Adaptive Fine-Tuning (DAFT) to selectively fine-tune the model. Experimental results show that our method achieves up to a 21% increase in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methodologies, indicating that our method maintains good model performance while demonstrating its robustness. Our code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Maximally Permissive Reward Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward machines allow the definition of rewards for temporally extended tasks and behaviors. Specifying "informative" reward machines can be challenging. One way to address this is to generate reward machines from a high-level abstract description of the learning environment, using techniques such as AI planning. However, previous planning-based approaches generate a reward machine based on a single (sequential or partial-order) plan, and do not allow maximum flexibility to the learning agent. In this paper we propose a new approach to synthesising reward machines which is based on the set of partial order plans for a goal. We prove that learning using such "maximally permissive" reward machines results in higher rewards than learning using RMs based on a single plan. We present experimental results which support our theoretical claims by showing that our approach obtains higher rewards than the single-plan approach in practice.</description>

      <title>Universality of Real Minimal Complexity Reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir Computing (RC) models, a subclass of recurrent neural networks, are distinguished by their fixed, non-trainable input layer and dynamically coupled reservoir, with only the static readout layer being trained. This design circumvents the issues associated with backpropagating error signals through time, thereby enhancing both stability and training efficiency. RC models have been successfully applied across a broad range of application domains. Crucially, they have been demonstrated to be universal approximators of time-invariant dynamic filters with fading memory, under various settings of approximation norms and input driving sources.
  Simple Cycle Reservoirs (SCR) represent a specialized class of RC models with a highly constrained reservoir architecture, characterized by uniform ring connectivity and binary input-to-reservoir weights with an aperiodic sign pattern. For linear reservoirs, given the reservoir size, the reservoir construction has only one degree of freedom -- the reservoir cycle weight. Such architectures are particularly amenable to hardware implementations without significant performance degradation in many practical tasks. In this study we endow these observations with solid theoretical foundations by proving that SCRs operating in real domain are universal approximators of time-invariant dynamic filters with fading memory. Our results supplement recent research showing that SCRs in the complex domain can approximate, to arbitrary precision, any unrestricted linear reservoir with a non-linear readout. We furthermore introduce a novel method to drastically reduce the number of SCR units, making such highly constrained architectures natural candidates for low-complexity hardware implementations. Our findings are supported by empirical studies on real-world time series datasets.</description>

      <title>Independent Policy Mirror Descent for Markov Potential Games: Scaling to Large Number of Players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov Potential Games (MPGs) form an important sub-class of Markov games, which are a common framework to model multi-agent reinforcement learning problems. In particular, MPGs include as a special case the identical-interest setting where all the agents share the same reward function. Scaling the performance of Nash equilibrium learning algorithms to a large number of agents is crucial for multi-agent systems. To address this important challenge, we focus on the independent learning setting where agents can only have access to their local information to update their own policy. In prior work on MPGs, the iteration complexity for obtaining $\epsilon$-Nash regret scales linearly with the number of agents $N$. In this work, we investigate the iteration complexity of an independent policy mirror descent (PMD) algorithm for MPGs. We show that PMD with KL regularization, also known as natural policy gradient, enjoys a better $\sqrt{N}$ dependence on the number of agents, improving over PMD with Euclidean regularization and prior work. Furthermore, the iteration complexity is also independent of the sizes of the agents' action spaces.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Replay for Class-Incremental Learning with Pre-trained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In general class-incremental learning, researchers typically use sample sets as a tool to avoid catastrophic forgetting during continuous learning. At the same time, researchers have also noted the differences between class-incremental learning and Oracle training and have attempted to make corrections. In recent years, researchers have begun to develop class-incremental learning algorithms utilizing pre-trained models, achieving significant results. This paper observes that in class-incremental learning, the steady state among the weight guided by each class center is disrupted, which is significantly correlated with catastrophic forgetting. Based on this, we propose a new method to overcoming forgetting . In some cases, by retaining only a single sample unit of each class in memory for replay and applying simple gradient constraints, very good results can be achieved. Experimental results indicate that under the condition of pre-trained models, our method can achieve competitive performance with very low computational cost and by simply using the cross-entropy loss.</description>

      <title>Adaptation of uncertainty-penalized Bayesian information criterion for parametric partial differential equation discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven discovery of partial differential equations (PDEs) has emerged as a promising approach for deriving governing physics when domain knowledge about observed data is limited. Despite recent progress, the identification of governing equations and their parametric dependencies using conventional information criteria remains challenging in noisy situations, as the criteria tend to select overly complex PDEs. In this paper, we introduce an extension of the uncertainty-penalized Bayesian information criterion (UBIC), which is adapted to solve parametric PDE discovery problems efficiently without requiring computationally expensive PDE simulations. This extended UBIC uses quantified PDE uncertainty over different temporal or spatial points to prevent overfitting in model selection. The UBIC is computed with data transformation based on power spectral densities to discover the governing parametric PDE that truly captures qualitative features in frequency space with a few significant terms and their parametric dependencies (i.e., the varying PDE coefficients), evaluated with confidence intervals. Numerical experiments on canonical PDEs demonstrate that our extended UBIC can identify the true number of terms and their varying coefficients accurately, even in the presence of noise. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Pongpisit-Thanasutives/parametric-discovery}.</description>

      <title>Hearing Your Blood Sugar: Non-Invasive Glucose Measurement Through Simple Vocal Signals, Transforming any Speech into a Sensor with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective diabetes management relies heavily on the continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels, traditionally achieved through invasive and uncomfortable methods. While various non-invasive techniques have been explored, such as optical, microwave, and electrochemical approaches, none have effectively supplanted these invasive technologies due to issues related to complexity, accuracy, and cost. In this study, we present a transformative and straightforward method that utilizes voice analysis to predict blood glucose levels. Our research investigates the relationship between fluctuations in blood glucose and vocal characteristics, highlighting the influence of blood vessel dynamics during voice production. By applying advanced machine learning algorithms, we analyzed vocal signal variations and established a significant correlation with blood glucose levels. We developed a predictive model using artificial intelligence, based on voice recordings and corresponding glucose measurements from participants, utilizing logistic regression and Ridge regularization. Our findings indicate that voice analysis may serve as a viable non-invasive alternative for glucose monitoring. This innovative approach not only has the potential to streamline and reduce the costs associated with diabetes management but also aims to enhance the quality of life for individuals living with diabetes by providing a painless and user-friendly method for monitoring blood sugar levels.</description>

      <title>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Solving Inverse Problems with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding model parameters from data is an essential task in science and engineering, from weather and climate forecasts to plasma control. Previous works have employed neural networks to greatly accelerate finding solutions to inverse problems. Of particular interest are end-to-end models which utilize differentiable simulations in order to backpropagate feedback from the simulated process to the network weights and enable roll-out of multiple time steps. So far, it has been assumed that, while model inference is faster than classical optimization, this comes at the cost of a decrease in solution accuracy. We show that this is generally not true. In fact, neural networks trained to learn solutions to inverse problems can find better solutions than classical optimizers even on their training set. To demonstrate this, we perform both a theoretical analysis as well an extensive empirical evaluation on challenging problems involving local minima, chaos, and zero-gradient regions. Our findings suggest an alternative use for neural networks: rather than generalizing to new data for fast inference, they can also be used to find better solutions on known data.</description>

      <title>EXPLAIN, AGREE, LEARN: Scaling Learning for Neural Probabilistic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural probabilistic logic systems follow the neuro-symbolic (NeSy) paradigm by combining the perceptive and learning capabilities of neural networks with the robustness of probabilistic logic. Learning corresponds to likelihood optimization of the neural networks. However, to obtain the likelihood exactly, expensive probabilistic logic inference is required. To scale learning to more complex systems, we therefore propose to instead optimize a sampling based objective. We prove that the objective has a bounded error with respect to the likelihood, which vanishes when increasing the sample count. Furthermore, the error vanishes faster by exploiting a new concept of sample diversity. We then develop the EXPLAIN, AGREE, LEARN (EXAL) method that uses this objective. EXPLAIN samples explanations for the data. AGREE reweighs each explanation in concordance with the neural component. LEARN uses the reweighed explanations as a signal for learning. In contrast to previous NeSy methods, EXAL can scale to larger problem sizes while retaining theoretical guarantees on the error. Experimentally, our theoretical claims are verified and EXAL outperforms recent NeSy methods when scaling up the MNIST addition and Warcraft pathfinding problems.</description>

      <title>Normalized AOPC: Fixing Misleading Faithfulness Metrics for Feature Attribution Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural network predictions are notoriously difficult to interpret. Feature attribution methods aim to explain these predictions by identifying the contribution of each input feature. Faithfulness, often evaluated using the area over the perturbation curve (AOPC), reflects feature attributions' accuracy in describing the internal mechanisms of deep neural networks. However, many studies rely on AOPC to compare faithfulness across different models, which we show can lead to false conclusions about models' faithfulness. Specifically, we find that AOPC is sensitive to variations in the model, resulting in unreliable cross-model comparisons. Moreover, AOPC scores are difficult to interpret in isolation without knowing the model-specific lower and upper limits. To address these issues, we propose a normalization approach, Normalized AOPC (NAOPC), enabling consistent cross-model evaluations and more meaningful interpretation of individual scores. Our experiments demonstrate that this normalization can radically change AOPC results, questioning the conclusions of earlier studies and offering a more robust framework for assessing feature attribution faithfulness.</description>

      <title>Impact of Comprehensive Data Preprocessing on Predictive Modelling of COVID-19 Mortality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate predictive models are crucial for analysing COVID-19 mortality trends. This study evaluates the impact of a custom data preprocessing pipeline on ten machine learning models predicting COVID-19 mortality using data from Our World in Data (OWID). Our pipeline differs from a standard preprocessing pipeline through four key steps. Firstly, it transforms weekly reported totals into daily updates, correcting reporting biases and providing more accurate estimates. Secondly, it uses localised outlier detection and processing to preserve data variance and enhance accuracy. Thirdly, it utilises computational dependencies among columns to ensure data consistency. Finally, it incorporates an iterative feature selection process to optimise the feature set and improve model performance. Results show a significant improvement with the custom pipeline: the MLP Regressor achieved a test RMSE of 66.556 and a test R-squared of 0.991, surpassing the DecisionTree Regressor from the standard pipeline, which had a test RMSE of 222.858 and a test R-squared of 0.817. These findings highlight the importance of tailored preprocessing techniques in enhancing predictive modelling accuracy for COVID-19 mortality. Although specific to this study, these methodologies offer valuable insights into diverse datasets and domains, improving predictive performance across various contexts.</description>

      <title>Machine learning empowered Modulation detection for OFDM-based signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a blind ML-based modulation detection for OFDM-based technologies. Unlike previous works that assume an ideal environment with precise knowledge of subcarrier count and cyclic prefix location, we consider blind modulation detection while accounting for realistic environmental parameters and imperfections. Our approach employs a ResNet network to simultaneously detect the modulation type and accurately locate the cyclic prefix. Specifically, after eliminating the environmental impact from the signal and accurately extracting the OFDM symbols, we convert these symbols into scatter plots. Due to their unique shapes, these scatter plots are then classified using ResNet. As a result, our proposed modulation classification method can be applied to any OFDM-based technology without prior knowledge of the transmitted signal. We evaluate its performance across various modulation schemes and subcarrier numbers. Simulation results show that our method achieves a modulation detection accuracy exceeding $80\%$ at an SNR of $10$ dB and $95\%$ at an SNR of $25$ dB.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Semi-Gradient Descent for Learning Mean Field Games with Population-Aware Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) model the interactions within a large-population multi-agent system using the population distribution. Traditional learning methods for MFGs are based on fixed-point iteration (FPI), which calculates best responses and induced population distribution separately and sequentially. However, FPI-type methods suffer from inefficiency and instability, due to oscillations caused by the forward-backward procedure. This paper considers an online learning method for MFGs, where an agent updates its policy and population estimates simultaneously and fully asynchronously, resulting in a simple stochastic gradient descent (SGD) type method called SemiSGD. Not only does SemiSGD exhibit numerical stability and efficiency, but it also provides a novel perspective by treating the value function and population distribution as a unified parameter. We theoretically show that SemiSGD directs this unified parameter along a descent direction to the mean field equilibrium. Motivated by this perspective, we develop a linear function approximation (LFA) for both the value function and the population distribution, resulting in the first population-aware LFA for MFGs on continuous state-action space. Finite-time convergence and approximation error analysis are provided for SemiSGD equipped with population-aware LFA.</description>

      <title>Does Reasoning Emerge? Examining the Probabilities of Causation in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI have been significantly driven by the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to solve complex problems in ways that resemble human thinking. However, there is an ongoing debate about the extent to which LLMs are capable of actual reasoning. Central to this debate are two key probabilistic concepts that are essential for connecting causes to their effects: the probability of necessity (PN) and the probability of sufficiency (PS). This paper introduces a framework that is both theoretical and practical, aimed at assessing how effectively LLMs are able to replicate real-world reasoning mechanisms using these probabilistic measures. By viewing LLMs as abstract machines that process information through a natural language interface, we examine the conditions under which it is possible to compute suitable approximations of PN and PS. Our research marks an important step towards gaining a deeper understanding of when LLMs are capable of reasoning, as illustrated by a series of math examples.</description>

      <title>Federated Fairness Analytics: Quantifying Fairness in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-enhancing technology for distributed ML. By training models locally and aggregating updates - a federation learns together, while bypassing centralised data collection. FL is increasingly popular in healthcare, finance and personal computing. However, it inherits fairness challenges from classical ML and introduces new ones, resulting from differences in data quality, client participation, communication constraints, aggregation methods and underlying hardware. Fairness remains an unresolved issue in FL and the community has identified an absence of succinct definitions and metrics to quantify fairness; to address this, we propose Federated Fairness Analytics - a methodology for measuring fairness. Our definition of fairness comprises four notions with novel, corresponding metrics. They are symptomatically defined and leverage techniques originating from XAI, cooperative game-theory and networking engineering. We tested a range of experimental settings, varying the FL approach, ML task and data settings. The results show that statistical heterogeneity and client participation affect fairness and fairness conscious approaches such as Ditto and q-FedAvg marginally improve fairness-performance trade-offs. Using our techniques, FL practitioners can uncover previously unobtainable insights into their system's fairness, at differing levels of granularity in order to address fairness challenges in FL. We have open-sourced our work at: https://github.com/oscardilley/federated-fairness.</description>

      <title>Moving Healthcare AI-Support Systems for Visually Detectable Diseases onto Constrained Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image classification usually requires connectivity and access to the cloud which is often limited in many parts of the world, including hard to reach rural areas. TinyML aims to solve this problem by hosting AI assistants on constrained devices, eliminating connectivity issues by processing data within the device itself, without internet or cloud access. This pilot study explores the use of tinyML to provide healthcare support with low spec devices in low connectivity environments, focusing on diagnosis of skin diseases and the ethical use of AI assistants in a healthcare setting. To investigate this, 10,000 images of skin lesions were used to train a model for classifying visually detectable diseases (VDDs). The model weights were then offloaded to a Raspberry Pi with a webcam attached, to be used for the classification of skin lesions without internet access. It was found that the developed prototype achieved a test accuracy of 78% and a test loss of 1.08.</description>

      <title>RED-CT: A Systems Design Methodology for Using LLM-labeled Data to Train and Deploy Edge Classifiers for Computational Social Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enhanced our ability to rapidly analyze and classify unstructured natural language data. However, concerns regarding cost, network limitations, and security constraints have posed challenges for their integration into work processes. In this study, we adopt a systems design approach to employing LLMs as imperfect data annotators for downstream supervised learning tasks, introducing novel system intervention measures aimed at improving classification performance. Our methodology outperforms LLM-generated labels in seven of eight tests, demonstrating an effective strategy for incorporating LLMs into the design and deployment of specialized, supervised learning models present in many industry use cases.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Sharpness-Aware Minimization by Learning Perturbation Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) is to improve model generalization by searching for flat minima in the loss landscape. The SAM update consists of one step for computing the perturbation and the other for computing the update gradient. Within the two steps, the choice of the perturbation radius is crucial to the performance of SAM, but finding an appropriate perturbation radius is challenging. In this paper, we propose a bilevel optimization framework called LEarning the perTurbation radiuS (LETS) to learn the perturbation radius for sharpness-aware minimization algorithms. Specifically, in the proposed LETS method, the upper-level problem aims at seeking a good perturbation radius by minimizing the squared generalization gap between the training and validation losses, while the lower-level problem is the SAM optimization problem. Moreover, the LETS method can be combined with any variant of SAM. Experimental results on various architectures and benchmark datasets in computer vision and natural language processing demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LETS method in improving the performance of SAM.</description>

      <title>Derivative-Free Guidance in Continuous and Discrete Diffusion Models with Soft Value-Based Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at capturing the natural design spaces of images, molecules, DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. However, rather than merely generating designs that are natural, we often aim to optimize downstream reward functions while preserving the naturalness of these design spaces. Existing methods for achieving this goal often require ``differentiable'' proxy models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier guidance or DPS) or involve computationally expensive fine-tuning of diffusion models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier-free guidance, RL-based fine-tuning). In our work, we propose a new method to address these challenges. Our algorithm is an iterative sampling method that integrates soft value functions, which looks ahead to how intermediate noisy states lead to high rewards in the future, into the standard inference procedure of pre-trained diffusion models. Notably, our approach avoids fine-tuning generative models and eliminates the need to construct differentiable models. This enables us to (1) directly utilize non-differentiable features/reward feedback, commonly used in many scientific domains, and (2) apply our method to recent discrete diffusion models in a principled way. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across several domains, including image generation, molecule generation, and DNA/RNA sequence generation.

      <title>GSVD-NMF: Recovering Missing Features in Non-negative Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is an important tool in signal processing and widely used to separate mixed sources into their components. However, NMF is NP-hard and thus may fail to discover the ideal factorization; moreover, the number of components may not be known in advance and thus features may be missed or incompletely separated. To recover missing components from under-complete NMF, we introduce GSVD-NMF, which proposes new components based on the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) between preliminary NMF results and the SVD of the original matrix. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that GSVD-NMF often recovers missing features from under-complete NMF and helps NMF achieve better local optima.</description>

      <title>BAM! Just Like That: Simple and Efficient Parameter Upcycling for Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework has become a popular architecture for large language models due to its superior performance over dense models. However, training MoEs from scratch in a large-scale regime is prohibitively expensive. Existing methods mitigate this by pre-training multiple dense expert models independently and using them to initialize an MoE. This is done by using experts' feed-forward network (FFN) to initialize the MoE's experts while merging other parameters. However, this method limits the reuse of dense model parameters to only the FFN layers, thereby constraining the advantages when "upcycling" these models into MoEs. We propose BAM (Branch-Attend-Mix), a simple yet effective method that addresses this shortcoming. BAM makes full use of specialized dense models by not only using their FFN to initialize the MoE layers but also leveraging experts' attention parameters fully by initializing them into a soft-variant of Mixture of Attention (MoA) layers. We explore two methods for upcycling attention parameters: 1) initializing separate attention experts from dense models including all attention parameters for the best model performance; and 2) sharing key and value parameters across all experts to facilitate for better inference efficiency. To further improve efficiency, we adopt a parallel attention transformer architecture to MoEs, which allows the attention experts and FFN experts to be computed concurrently. Our experiments on seed models ranging from 590 million to 2 billion parameters demonstrate that BAM surpasses baselines in both perplexity and downstream task performance, within the same computational and data constraints.</description>

      <title>Absence of Closed-Form Descriptions for Gradient Flow in Two-Layer Narrow Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of machine learning, comprehending the intricate training dynamics of neural networks poses a significant challenge. This paper explores the training dynamics of neural networks, particularly whether these dynamics can be expressed in a general closed-form solution. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the gradient flow in two-layer narrow networks is not an integrable system. Integrable systems are characterized by trajectories confined to submanifolds defined by level sets of first integrals (invariants), facilitating predictable and reducible dynamics. In contrast, non-integrable systems exhibit complex behaviors that are difficult to predict. To establish the non-integrability, we employ differential Galois theory, which focuses on the solvability of linear differential equations. We demonstrate that under mild conditions, the identity component of the differential Galois group of the variational equations of the gradient flow is non-solvable. This result confirms the system's non-integrability and implies that the training dynamics cannot be represented by Liouvillian functions, precluding a closed-form solution for describing these dynamics. Our findings highlight the necessity of employing numerical methods to tackle optimization problems within neural networks. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of neural network training dynamics and their implications for machine learning optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Local Geometry of Generative Model Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generative models learn continuous representations of complex data manifolds using a finite number of samples during training. For a pre-trained generative model, the common way to evaluate the quality of the manifold representation learned, is by computing global metrics like Fr\'echet Inception Distance using a large number of generated and real samples. However, generative model performance is not uniform across the learned manifold, e.g., for \textit{foundation models} like Stable Diffusion generation performance can vary significantly based on the conditioning or initial noise vector being denoised. In this paper we study the relationship between the \textit{local geometry of the learned manifold} and downstream generation. Based on the theory of continuous piecewise-linear (CPWL) generators, we use three geometric descriptors - scaling ($\psi$), rank ($\nu$), and complexity ($\delta$) - to characterize a pre-trained generative model manifold locally. We provide quantitative and qualitative evidence showing that for a given latent, the local descriptors are correlated with generation aesthetics, artifacts, uncertainty, and even memorization. Finally we demonstrate that training a \textit{reward model} on the local geometry can allow controlling the likelihood of a generated sample under the learned distribution.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Understand Symbolic Graphics Programs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is often challenging, in part, because it is hard to find tasks to which they have not been exposed during training. We take one step to address this challenge by turning to a new task: focusing on symbolic graphics programs, which are a popular representation for graphics content that procedurally generates visual data. LLMs have shown exciting promise towards program synthesis, but do they understand symbolic graphics programs? Unlike conventional programs, symbolic graphics programs can be translated to graphics content. Here, we characterize an LLM's understanding of symbolic programs in terms of their ability to answer questions related to the graphics content. This task is challenging as the questions are difficult to answer from the symbolic programs alone -- yet, they would be easy to answer from the corresponding graphics content as we verify through a human experiment. To understand symbolic programs, LLMs may need to possess the ability to imagine how the corresponding graphics content would look without directly accessing the rendered visual content. We use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the semantic understanding of symbolic graphics programs. This benchmark is built via program-graphics correspondence, hence requiring minimal human efforts. We evaluate current LLMs on our benchmark to elucidate a preliminary assessment of their ability to reason about visual scenes from programs. We find that this task distinguishes existing LLMs and models considered good at reasoning perform better. Lastly, we introduce Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT) to improve this ability. Specifically, we query GPT4-o with questions and images generated by symbolic programs. Such data are then used to finetune an LLM. We also find that SIT data can improve the general instruction following ability of LLMs.</description>

Abstract: Emerging evidence indicates that human cancers are intricately linked to human microbiomes, forming an inseparable connection. However, due to limited sample sizes and significant data loss during collection for various reasons, some machine learning methods have been proposed to address the issue of missing data. These methods have not fully utilized the known clinical information of patients to enhance the accuracy of data imputation. Therefore, we introduce mbVDiT, a novel pre-trained conditional diffusion model for microbiome data imputation and denoising, which uses the unmasked data and patient metadata as conditional guidance for imputating missing values. It is also uses VAE to integrate the the other public microbiome datasets to enhance model performance. The results on the microbiome datasets from three different cancer types demonstrate the performance of our methods in comparison with existing methods.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-based Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Cosserat Rod-based Soft Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft robots have many advantages over rigid robots thanks to their compliant and passive nature. However, it is generally challenging to model the dynamics of soft robots due to their high spatial dimensionality, making it difficult to use model-based methods to accurately control soft robots. It often requires direct numerical simulation of partial differential equations to simulate soft robots. This not only requires an accurate numerical model, but also makes soft robot modeling slow and expensive. Deep learning algorithms have shown promises in data-driven modeling of soft robots. However, these algorithms usually require a large amount of data, which are difficult to obtain in either simulation or real-world experiments of soft robots. In this work, we propose KNODE-Cosserat, a framework that combines first-principle physics models and neural ordinary differential equations. We leverage the best from both worlds -- the generalization ability of physics-based models and the fast speed of deep learning methods. We validate our framework in both simulation and real-world experiments. In both cases, we show that the robot model significantly improves over the baseline models under different metrics.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the efficiencies and explanatory abilities of extensions to the common tools of Autoencoders and LLM interpreters, in the novel context of comparing different cultural approaches to the same international news event. We develop a new Convolutional-Recurrent Variational Autoencoder (CRVAE) model that extends the modalities of previous CVAE models, by using fully-connected latent layers to embed in parallel the CNN encodings of video frames, together with the LSTM encodings of their related text derived from audio. We incorporate the model within a larger system that includes frame-caption alignment, latent space vector clustering, and a novel LLM-based cluster interpreter. We measure, tune, and apply this system to the task of summarizing a video into three to five thematic clusters, with each theme described by ten LLM-produced phrases. We apply this system to two news topics, COVID-19 and the Winter Olympics, and five other topics are in progress.</description>

      <title>Ranking and Combining Latent Structured Predictive Scores without Labeled Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining multiple predictors obtained from distributed data sources to an accurate meta-learner is promising to achieve enhanced performance in lots of prediction problems. As the accuracy of each predictor is usually unknown, integrating the predictors to achieve better performance is challenging. Conventional ensemble learning methods assess the accuracy of predictors based on extensive labeled data. In practical applications, however, the acquisition of such labeled data can prove to be an arduous task. Furthermore, the predictors under consideration may exhibit high degrees of correlation, particularly when similar data sources or machine learning algorithms were employed during their model training. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces a novel structured unsupervised ensemble learning model (SUEL) to exploit the dependency between a set of predictors with continuous predictive scores, rank the predictors without labeled data and combine them to an ensembled score with weights. Two novel correlation-based decomposition algorithms are further proposed to estimate the SUEL model, constrained quadratic optimization (SUEL.CQO) and matrix-factorization-based (SUEL.MF) approaches. The efficacy of the proposed methods is rigorously assessed through both simulation studies and real-world application of risk genes discovery. The results compellingly demonstrate that the proposed methods can efficiently integrate the dependent predictors to an ensemble model without the need of ground truth data.</description>

      <title>Regularized Contrastive Partial Multi-view Outlier Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, multi-view outlier detection (MVOD) methods have advanced significantly, aiming to identify outliers within multi-view datasets. A key point is to better detect class outliers and class-attribute outliers, which only exist in multi-view data. However, existing methods either is not able to reduce the impact of outliers when learning view-consistent information, or struggle in cases with varying neighborhood structures. Moreover, most of them do not apply to partial multi-view data in real-world scenarios. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a novel method named Regularized Contrastive Partial Multi-view Outlier Detection (RCPMOD). In this framework, we utilize contrastive learning to learn view-consistent information and distinguish outliers by the degree of consistency. Specifically, we propose (1) An outlier-aware contrastive loss with a potential outlier memory bank to eliminate their bias motivated by a theoretical analysis. (2) A neighbor alignment contrastive loss to capture the view-shared local structural correlation. (3) A spreading regularization loss to prevent the model from overfitting over outliers. With the Cross-view Relation Transfer technique, we could easily impute the missing view samples based on the features of neighbors. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach could outperform state-of-the-art competitors under different settings.</description>

Abstract: We explore the application of large language models (LLMs), pre-trained models with massive textual data for detecting and improving these altered states. We investigate the use of LLMs to estimate attention states, sleep stages, and sleep quality and generate sleep improvement suggestions and adaptive guided imagery scripts based on electroencephalogram (EEG) and physical activity data (e.g. waveforms, power spectrogram images, numerical features). Our results show that LLMs can estimate sleep quality based on human textual behavioral features and provide personalized sleep improvement suggestions and guided imagery scripts; however detecting attention, sleep stages, and sleep quality based on EEG and activity data requires further training data and domain-specific knowledge.</description>

      <title>CarbonClipper: Optimal Algorithms for Carbon-Aware Spatiotemporal Workload Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study carbon-aware spatiotemporal workload management, which seeks to address the growing environmental impact of data centers. We formalize this as an online problem called spatiotemporal online allocation with deadline constraints ($\mathsf{SOAD}$), in which an online player completes a workload (e.g., a batch compute job) by moving and scheduling the workload across a network subject to a deadline $T$. At each time step, a service cost function is revealed, representing, e.g., the carbon intensity of servicing a workload at each location, and the player must irrevocably decide the current allocation. Furthermore, whenever the player moves the allocation, it incurs a movement cost defined by a metric space $(X,d)$ that captures, e.g., the overhead of migrating a compute job. $\mathsf{SOAD}$ formalizes the open problem of combining general metrics and deadline constraints in the online algorithms literature, unifying problems such as metrical task systems and online search. We propose a competitive algorithm for $\mathsf{SOAD}$ along with a matching lower bound that proves it is optimal. Our main algorithm, ${\rm C{\scriptsize ARBON}C{\scriptsize LIPPER}}$, is a learning-augmented algorithm that takes advantage of predictions (e.g., carbon intensity forecasts) and achieves an optimal consistency-robustness trade-off. We evaluate our proposed algorithms for carbon-aware spatiotemporal workload management on a simulated global data center network, showing that ${\rm C{\scriptsize ARBON}C{\scriptsize LIPPER}}$ significantly improves performance compared to baseline methods and delivers meaningful carbon reductions.</description>

      <title>Time-inversion of spatiotemporal beam dynamics using uncertainty-aware latent evolution reversal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charged particle dynamics under the influence of electromagnetic fields is a challenging spatiotemporal problem. Many high performance physics-based simulators for predicting behavior in a charged particle beam are computationally expensive, limiting their utility for solving inverse problems online. The problem of estimating upstream six-dimensional phase space given downstream measurements of charged particles in an accelerator is an inverse problem of growing importance. This paper introduces a reverse Latent Evolution Model (rLEM) designed for temporal inversion of forward beam dynamics. In this two-step self-supervised deep learning framework, we utilize a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to project 6D phase space projections of a charged particle beam into a lower-dimensional latent distribution. Subsequently, we autoregressively learn the inverse temporal dynamics in the latent space using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The coupled CVAE-LSTM framework can predict 6D phase space projections across all upstream accelerating sections based on single or multiple downstream phase space measurements as inputs. The proposed model also captures the aleatoric uncertainty of the high-dimensional input data within the latent space. This uncertainty, which reflects potential uncertain measurements at a given module, is propagated through the LSTM to estimate uncertainty bounds for all upstream predictions, demonstrating the robustness of the LSTM against in-distribution variations in the input data.</description>

      <title>Training Language Models on the Knowledge Graph: Insights on Hallucinations and Their Detectability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While many capabilities of language models (LMs) improve with increased training budget, the influence of scale on hallucinations is not yet fully understood. Hallucinations come in many forms, and there is no universally accepted definition. We thus focus on studying only those hallucinations where a correct answer appears verbatim in the training set. To fully control the training data content, we construct a knowledge graph (KG)-based dataset, and use it to train a set of increasingly large LMs. We find that for a fixed dataset, larger and longer-trained LMs hallucinate less. However, hallucinating on $\leq5$% of the training data requires an order of magnitude larger model, and thus an order of magnitude more compute, than Hoffmann et al. (2022) reported was optimal. Given this costliness, we study how hallucination detectors depend on scale. While we see detector size improves performance on fixed LM's outputs, we find an inverse relationship between the scale of the LM and the detectability of its hallucinations.</description>

      <title>CON-FOLD -- Explainable Machine Learning with Confidence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FOLD-RM is an explainable machine learning classification algorithm that uses training data to create a set of classification rules. In this paper we introduce CON-FOLD which extends FOLD-RM in several ways. CON-FOLD assigns probability-based confidence scores to rules learned for a classification task. This allows users to know how confident they should be in a prediction made by the model. We present a confidence-based pruning algorithm that uses the unique structure of FOLD-RM rules to efficiently prune rules and prevent overfitting. Furthermore, CON-FOLD enables the user to provide pre-existing knowledge in the form of logic program rules that are either (fixed) background knowledge or (modifiable) initial rule candidates. The paper describes our method in detail and reports on practical experiments. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. For that, we introduce a new metric, Inverse Brier Score, to evaluate the accuracy of the produced confidence scores. Finally we apply this extension to a real world example that requires explainability: marking of student responses to a short answer question from the Australian Physics Olympiad.</description>

      <title>Capturing the Complexity of Human Strategic Decision-Making with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how people behave in strategic settings--where they make decisions based on their expectations about the behavior of others--is a long-standing problem in the behavioral sciences. We conduct the largest study to date of strategic decision-making in the context of initial play in two-player matrix games, analyzing over 90,000 human decisions across more than 2,400 procedurally generated games that span a much wider space than previous datasets. We show that a deep neural network trained on these data predicts people's choices better than leading theories of strategic behavior, indicating that there is systematic variation that is not explained by those theories. We then modify the network to produce a new, interpretable behavioral model, revealing what the original network learned about people: their ability to optimally respond and their capacity to reason about others are dependent on the complexity of individual games. This context-dependence is critical in explaining deviations from the rational Nash equilibrium, response times, and uncertainty in strategic decisions. More broadly, our results demonstrate how machine learning can be applied beyond prediction to further help generate novel explanations of complex human behavior.</description>

      <title>IReCa: Intrinsic Reward-enhanced Context-aware Reinforcement Learning for Human-AI Coordination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In human-AI coordination scenarios, human agents usually exhibit asymmetric behaviors that are significantly sparse and unpredictable compared to those of AI agents. These characteristics introduce two primary challenges to human-AI coordination: the effectiveness of obtaining sparse rewards and the efficiency of training the AI agents. To tackle these challenges, we propose an Intrinsic Reward-enhanced Context-aware (IReCa) reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, which leverages intrinsic rewards to facilitate the acquisition of sparse rewards and utilizes environmental context to enhance training efficiency. Our IReCa RL algorithm introduces three unique features: (i) it encourages the exploration of sparse rewards by incorporating intrinsic rewards that supplement traditional extrinsic rewards from the environment; (ii) it improves the acquisition of sparse rewards by prioritizing the corresponding sparse state-action pairs; and (iii) it enhances the training efficiency by optimizing the exploration and exploitation through innovative context-aware weights of extrinsic and intrinsic rewards. Extensive simulations executed in the Overcooked layouts demonstrate that our IReCa RL algorithm can increase the accumulated rewards by approximately 20% and reduce the epochs required for convergence by approximately 67% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Local Causal Discovery with Background Knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causality plays a pivotal role in various fields of study. Based on the framework of causal graphical models, previous works have proposed identifying whether a variable is a cause or non-cause of a target in every Markov equivalent graph solely by learning a local structure. However, the presence of prior knowledge, often represented as a partially known causal graph, is common in many causal modeling applications. Leveraging this prior knowledge allows for the further identification of causal relationships. In this paper, we first propose a method for learning the local structure using all types of causal background knowledge, including direct causal information, non-ancestral information and ancestral information. Then we introduce criteria for identifying causal relationships based solely on the local structure in the presence of prior knowledge. We also apply out method to fair machine learning, and experiments involving local structure learning, causal relationship identification, and fair machine learning demonstrate that our method is both effective and efficient.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired Interpretable Deep Learning Architecture for Text Sentiment Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text has become the predominant form of communication on social media, embedding a wealth of emotional nuances. Consequently, the extraction of emotional information from text is of paramount importance. Despite previous research making some progress, existing text sentiment analysis models still face challenges in integrating diverse semantic information and lack interpretability. To address these issues, we propose a quantum-inspired deep learning architecture that combines fundamental principles of quantum mechanics (QM principles) with deep learning models for text sentiment analysis. Specifically, we analyze the commonalities between text representation and QM principles to design a quantum-inspired text representation method and further develop a quantum-inspired text embedding layer. Additionally, we design a feature extraction layer based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and self-attention mechanisms (SAMs). Finally, we calculate the text density matrix using the quantum complex numbers principle and apply 2D-convolution neural networks (CNNs) for feature condensation and dimensionality reduction. Through a series of visualization, comparative, and ablation experiments, we demonstrate that our model not only shows significant advantages in accuracy and efficiency compared to previous related models but also achieves a certain level of interpretability by integrating QM principles. Our code is available at QISA.</description>

      <title>System States Forecasting of Microservices with Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) era, accurately forecasting system states is crucial. In microservices systems, this task encounters the challenge of dynamic and complex spatio-temporal relationships among microservice instances, primarily due to dynamic deployments, diverse call paths, and cascading effects among instances. Current time-series forecasting methods, which focus mainly on intrinsic patterns, are insufficient in environments where spatial relationships are critical. Similarly, spatio-temporal graph approaches often neglect the nature of temporal trend, concentrating mostly on message passing between nodes. Moreover, current research in microservices domain frequently underestimates the importance of network metrics and topological structures in capturing the evolving dynamics of systems. This paper introduces STMformer, a model tailored for forecasting system states in microservices environments, capable of handling multi-node and multivariate time series. Our method leverages dynamic network connection data and topological information to assist in modeling the intricate spatio-temporal relationships within the system. Additionally, we integrate the PatchCrossAttention module to compute the impact of cascading effects globally. We have developed a dataset based on a microservices system and conducted comprehensive experiments with STMformer against leading methods. In both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks, our model consistently achieved a 8.6% reduction in MAE(Mean Absolute Error) and a 2.2% reduction in MSE (Mean Squared Error).

      <title>A Deep Features-Based Approach Using Modified ResNet50 and Gradient Boosting for Visual Sentiments Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The versatile nature of Visual Sentiment Analysis (VSA) is one reason for its rising profile. It isn't easy to efficiently manage social media data with visual information since previous research has concentrated on Sentiment Analysis (SA) of single modalities, like textual. In addition, most visual sentiment studies need to adequately classify sentiment because they are mainly focused on simply merging modal attributes without investigating their intricate relationships. This prompted the suggestion of developing a fusion of deep learning and machine learning algorithms. In this research, a deep feature-based method for multiclass classification has been used to extract deep features from modified ResNet50. Furthermore, gradient boosting algorithm has been used to classify photos containing emotional content. The approach is thoroughly evaluated on two benchmarked datasets, CrowdFlower and GAPED. Finally, cutting-edge deep learning and machine learning models were used to compare the proposed strategy. When compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method demonstrates exceptional performance on the datasets presented.</description>

      <title>MobileMEF: Fast and Efficient Method for Multi-Exposure Fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in camera design and imaging technology have enabled the capture of high-quality images using smartphones. However, due to the limited dynamic range of digital cameras, the quality of photographs captured in environments with highly imbalanced lighting often results in poor-quality images. To address this issue, most devices capture multi-exposure frames and then use some multi-exposure fusion method to merge those frames into a final fused image. Nevertheless, most traditional and current deep learning approaches are unsuitable for real-time applications on mobile devices due to their heavy computational and memory requirements. We propose a new method for multi-exposure fusion based on an encoder-decoder deep learning architecture with efficient building blocks tailored for mobile devices. This efficient design makes our model capable of processing 4K resolution images in less than 2 seconds on mid-range smartphones. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques regarding full-reference quality measures and computational efficiency (runtime and memory usage), making it ideal for real-time applications on hardware-constrained devices.

      <title>Robust Offline Active Learning on Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of active learning on graphs, which has crucial applications in many real-world networks where labeling node responses is expensive. In this paper, we propose an offline active learning method that selects nodes to query by explicitly incorporating information from both the network structure and node covariates. Building on graph signal recovery theories and the random spectral sparsification technique, the proposed method adopts a two-stage biased sampling strategy that takes both informativeness and representativeness into consideration for node querying. Informativeness refers to the complexity of graph signals that are learnable from the responses of queried nodes, while representativeness refers to the capacity of queried nodes to control generalization errors given noisy node-level information. We establish a theoretical relationship between generalization error and the number of nodes selected by the proposed method. Our theoretical results demonstrate the trade-off between informativeness and representativeness in active learning. Extensive numerical experiments show that the proposed method is competitive with existing graph-based active learning methods, especially when node covariates and responses contain noises. Additionally, the proposed method is applicable to both regression and classification tasks on graphs.</description>

      <title>Coupling without Communication and Drafter-Invariant Speculative Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose Alice has a distribution $P$ and Bob has a distribution $Q$. Alice wants to generate a sample $a\sim P$ and Bob a sample $b \sim Q$ such that $a = b$ with has as high of probability as possible. It is well-known that, by sampling from an optimal coupling between the distributions, Alice and Bob can achieve $Pr[a = b] = 1 - D_{TV}(P,Q)$, where $D_{TV}(P,Q)$ is the total variation distance. What if Alice and Bob must solve this same problem without communicating at all? Perhaps surprisingly, with access to public randomness, they can still achieve $Pr[a = b] \geq \frac{1 - D_{TV}(P,Q)}{1 + D_{TV}(P,Q)} \geq 1-2D_{TV}(P,Q)$. In fact, this bound can be obtained using a simple protocol based on the Weighted MinHash algorithm. In this work, we explore the communication-free coupling in greater depth. First, we show that an equally simple protocol based on Gumbel sampling matches the worst-case guarantees of the Weighted MinHash approach, but tends to perform better in practice. Conversely, we prove that both approaches are actually sharp: no communication-free protocol can achieve $Pr[a=b]&gt;\frac{1 - D_{TV}(P,Q)}{1 + D_{TV}(P,Q)}$ in the worst-case. Finally, we prove that, for distributions over $n$ items, there exists a scheme that uses just $O(\log(n/\epsilon))$ bits of communication to achieve $Pr[a = b] = 1 - D_{TV}(P,Q) - \epsilon$, i.e. to essentially match optimal coupling. Beyond our theoretical results, we demonstrate an application of communication-free coupling to speculative decoding, a recent method for accelerating autoregressive large language models [Leviathan, Kalman, Matias, ICML 2023]. We show that communication-free protocols yield a variant of speculative decoding that we call Drafter-Invariant Speculative Decoding, which has the desirable property that the output of the method is fixed given a fixed random seed, regardless of what drafter is used for speculation.</description>

      <title>Hessian QM9: A quantum chemistry database of molecular Hessians in implicit solvents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant challenge in computational chemistry is developing approximations that accelerate \emph{ab initio} methods while preserving accuracy. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have emerged as a promising solution for constructing atomistic potentials that can be transferred across different molecular and crystalline systems. Most MLIPs are trained only on energies and forces in vacuum, while an improved description of the potential energy surface could be achieved by including the curvature of the potential energy surface. We present Hessian QM9, the first database of equilibrium configurations and numerical Hessian matrices, consisting of 41,645 molecules from the QM9 dataset at the $\omega$B97x/6-31G* level. Molecular Hessians were calculated in vacuum, as well as water, tetrahydrofuran, and toluene using an implicit solvation model. To demonstrate the utility of this dataset, we show that incorporating second derivatives of the potential energy surface into the loss function of a MLIP significantly improves the prediction of vibrational frequencies in all solvent environments, thus making this dataset extremely useful for studying organic molecules in realistic solvent environments for experimental characterization.</description>

      <title>Asteroid: Resource-Efficient Hybrid Pipeline Parallelism for Collaborative DNN Training on Heterogeneous Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-device Deep Neural Network (DNN) training has been recognized as crucial for privacy-preserving machine learning at the edge. However, the intensive training workload and limited onboard computing resources pose significant challenges to the availability and efficiency of model training. While existing works address these challenges through native resource management optimization, we instead leverage our observation that edge environments usually comprise a rich set of accompanying trusted edge devices with idle resources beyond a single terminal. We propose Asteroid, a distributed edge training system that breaks the resource walls across heterogeneous edge devices for efficient model training acceleration. Asteroid adopts a hybrid pipeline parallelism to orchestrate distributed training, along with a judicious parallelism planning for maximizing throughput under certain resource constraints. Furthermore, a fault-tolerant yet lightweight pipeline replay mechanism is developed to tame the device-level dynamics for training robustness and performance stability. We implement Asteroid on heterogeneous edge devices with both vision and language models, demonstrating up to 12.2x faster training than conventional parallelism methods and 2.1x faster than state-of-the-art hybrid parallelism methods through evaluations. Furthermore, Asteroid can recover training pipeline 14x faster than baseline methods while preserving comparable throughput despite unexpected device exiting and failure.</description>

      <title>Accelerating High-Fidelity Waveform Generation via Adversarial Flow Matching Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces PeriodWave-Turbo, a high-fidelity and high-efficient waveform generation model via adversarial flow matching optimization. Recently, conditional flow matching (CFM) generative models have been successfully adopted for waveform generation tasks, leveraging a single vector field estimation objective for training. Although these models can generate high-fidelity waveform signals, they require significantly more ODE steps compared to GAN-based models, which only need a single generation step. Additionally, the generated samples often lack high-frequency information due to noisy vector field estimation, which fails to ensure high-frequency reproduction. To address this limitation, we enhance pre-trained CFM-based generative models by incorporating a fixed-step generator modification. We utilized reconstruction losses and adversarial feedback to accelerate high-fidelity waveform generation. Through adversarial flow matching optimization, it only requires 1,000 steps of fine-tuning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various objective metrics. Moreover, we significantly reduce inference speed from 16 steps to 2 or 4 steps. Additionally, by scaling up the backbone of PeriodWave from 29M to 70M parameters for improved generalization, PeriodWave-Turbo achieves unprecedented performance, with a perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) score of 4.454 on the LibriTTS dataset. Audio samples, source code and checkpoints will be available at https://github.com/sh-lee-prml/PeriodWave.</description>

      <title>Navigating Data Scarcity using Foundation Models: A Benchmark of Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Learning Approaches in Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data scarcity is a major limiting factor for applying modern machine learning techniques to clinical tasks. Although sufficient data exists for some well-studied medical tasks, there remains a long tail of clinically relevant tasks with poor data availability. Recently, numerous foundation models have demonstrated high suitability for few-shot learning (FSL) and zero-shot learning (ZSL), potentially making them more accessible to practitioners. However, it remains unclear which foundation model performs best on FSL medical image analysis tasks and what the optimal methods are for learning from limited data. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark study of ZSL and FSL using 16 pretrained foundation models on 19 diverse medical imaging datasets. Our results indicate that BiomedCLIP, a model pretrained exclusively on medical data, performs best on average for very small training set sizes, while very large CLIP models pretrained on LAION-2B perform best with slightly more training samples. However, simply fine-tuning a ResNet-18 pretrained on ImageNet performs similarly with more than five training examples per class. Our findings also highlight the need for further research on foundation models specifically tailored for medical applications and the collection of more datasets to train these models.</description>

      <title>BINDy -- Bayesian identification of nonlinear dynamics with reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte-Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model parsimony is an important \emph{cognitive bias} in data-driven modelling that aids interpretability and helps to prevent over-fitting. Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) methods are able to learn sparse representations of complex dynamics directly from data, given a basis of library functions. In this work, a novel Bayesian treatment of dictionary learning system identification, as an alternative to SINDy, is envisaged. The proposed method -- Bayesian identification of nonlinear dynamics (BINDy) -- is distinct from previous approaches in that it targets the full joint posterior distribution over both the terms in the library and their parameterisation in the model. This formulation confers the advantage that an arbitrary prior may be placed over the model structure to produce models that are sparse in the model space rather than in parameter space. Because this posterior is defined over parameter vectors that can change in dimension, the inference cannot be performed by standard techniques. Instead, a Gibbs sampler based on reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte-Carlo is proposed. BINDy is shown to compare favourably to ensemble SINDy in three benchmark case-studies. In particular, it is seen that the proposed method is better able to assign high probability to correct model terms.</description>

      <title>Extracting Sentence Embeddings from Pretrained Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background/introduction: Pre-trained transformer models shine in many natural language processing tasks and therefore are expected to bear the representation of the input sentence or text meaning. These sentence-level embeddings are also important in retrieval-augmented generation. But do commonly used plain averaging or prompt templates surface it enough?
  Methods: Given 110M parameters BERT's hidden representations from multiple layers and multiple tokens we tried various ways to extract optimal sentence representations. We tested various token aggregation and representation post-processing techniques. We also tested multiple ways of using a general Wikitext dataset to complement BERTs sentence representations. All methods were tested on 8 Semantic Textual Similarity (STS), 6 short text clustering, and 12 classification tasks. We also evaluated our representation-shaping techniques on other static models, including random token representations.
  Results: Proposed representation extraction methods improved the performance on STS and clustering tasks for all models considered. Very high improvements for static token-based models, especially random embeddings for STS tasks almost reach the performance of BERT-derived representations.
  Conclusions: Our work shows that for multiple tasks simple baselines with representation shaping techniques reach or even outperform more complex BERT-based models or are able to contribute to their performance.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The forthcoming generation of wireless technology, 6G, promises a revolutionary leap beyond traditional data-centric services. It aims to usher in an era of ubiquitous intelligent services, where everything is interconnected and intelligent. This vision requires the seamless integration of three fundamental modules: Sensing for information acquisition, communication for information sharing, and computation for information processing and decision-making. These modules are intricately linked, especially in complex tasks such as edge learning and inference. However, the performance of these modules is interdependent, creating a resource competition for time, energy, and bandwidth. Existing techniques like integrated communication and computation (ICC), integrated sensing and computation (ISC), and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) have made partial strides in addressing this challenge, but they fall short of meeting the extreme performance requirements. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to develop new techniques that comprehensively integrate sensing, communication, and computation. This integrated approach, known as Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation (ISCC), offers a systematic perspective for enhancing task performance. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of historic and related techniques such as ICC, ISC, and ISAC, highlighting their strengths and limitations. It then explores the state-of-the-art signal designs for ISCC, along with network resource management strategies specifically tailored for ISCC. Furthermore, this paper discusses the exciting research opportunities that lie ahead for implementing ISCC in future advanced networks. By embracing ISCC, we can unlock the full potential of intelligent connectivity, paving the way for groundbreaking applications and services.</description>

      <title>Learned denoising with simulated and experimental low-dose CT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Like in many other research fields, recent developments in computational imaging have focused on developing machine learning (ML) approaches to tackle its main challenges. To improve the performance of computational imaging algorithms, machine learning methods are used for image processing tasks such as noise reduction. Generally, these ML methods heavily rely on the availability of high-quality data on which they are trained. This work explores the application of ML methods, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in the context of noise reduction for computed tomography (CT) imaging. We utilize a large 2D computed tomography dataset for machine learning to carry out for the first time a comprehensive study on the differences between the observed performances of algorithms trained on simulated noisy data and on real-world experimental noisy data. The study compares the performance of two common CNN architectures, U-Net and MSD-Net, that are trained and evaluated on both simulated and experimental noisy data. The results show that while sinogram denoising performed better with simulated noisy data if evaluated in the sinogram domain, the performance did not carry over to the reconstruction domain where training on experimental noisy data shows a higher performance in denoising experimental noisy data. Training the algorithms in an end-to-end fashion from sinogram to reconstruction significantly improved model performance, emphasizing the importance of matching raw measurement data to high-quality CT reconstructions. The study furthermore suggests the need for more sophisticated noise simulation approaches to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data in CT image denoising applications and gives insights into the challenges and opportunities in leveraging simulated data for machine learning in computational imaging.</description>

      <title>P/D-Serve: Serving Disaggregated Large Language Model at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Serving disaggregated large language models (LLMs) over tens of thousands of xPU devices (GPUs or NPUs) with reliable performance faces multiple challenges. 1) Ignoring the diversity (various prefixes and tidal requests), treating all the prompts in a mixed pool is inadequate. To facilitate the similarity per scenario and minimize the inner mismatch on P/D (prefill and decoding) processing, fine-grained organization is required, dynamically adjusting P/D ratios for better performance. 2) Due to inaccurate estimation on workload (queue status or maintained connections), the global scheduler easily incurs unnecessary timeouts in prefill. 3) Block-fixed device-to-device (D2D) KVCache transfer over cluster-level RDMA (remote direct memory access) fails to achieve desired D2D utilization as expected. To overcome previous problems, this paper proposes an end-to-end system P/D-Serve, complying with the paradigm of MLOps (machine learning operations), which models end-to-end (E2E) P/D performance and enables: 1) fine-grained P/D organization, mapping the service with RoCE (RDMA over converged ethernet) as needed, to facilitate similar processing and dynamic adjustments on P/D ratios; 2) on-demand forwarding upon rejections for idle prefill, decoupling the scheduler from regular inaccurate reports and local queues, to avoid timeouts in prefill; and 3) efficient KVCache transfer via optimized D2D access. P/D-Serve is implemented upon Ascend and MindSpore, has been deployed over tens of thousands of NPUs for more than eight months in commercial use, and further achieves 60\%, 42\% and 46\% improvements on E2E throughput, time-to-first-token (TTFT) SLO (service level objective) and D2D transfer time. As the E2E system with optimizations, P/D-Serve achieves 6.7x increase on throughput, compared with aggregated LLMs.</description>

      <title>DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5: Harnessing Proof Assistant Feedback for Reinforcement Learning and Monte-Carlo Tree Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5, an open-source language model designed for theorem proving in Lean 4, which enhances DeepSeek-Prover-V1 by optimizing both training and inference processes. Pre-trained on DeepSeekMath-Base with specialization in formal mathematical languages, the model undergoes supervised fine-tuning using an enhanced formal theorem proving dataset derived from DeepSeek-Prover-V1. Further refinement is achieved through reinforcement learning from proof assistant feedback (RLPAF). Beyond the single-pass whole-proof generation approach of DeepSeek-Prover-V1, we propose RMaxTS, a variant of Monte-Carlo tree search that employs an intrinsic-reward-driven exploration strategy to generate diverse proof paths. DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 demonstrates significant improvements over DeepSeek-Prover-V1, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the test set of the high school level miniF2F benchmark ($63.5\%$) and the undergraduate level ProofNet benchmark ($25.3\%$).</description>

      <title>Towards flexible perception with visual memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training a neural network is a monolithic endeavor, akin to carving knowledge into stone: once the process is completed, editing the knowledge in a network is nearly impossible, since all information is distributed across the network's weights. We here explore a simple, compelling alternative by marrying the representational power of deep neural networks with the flexibility of a database. Decomposing the task of image classification into image similarity (from a pre-trained embedding) and search (via fast nearest neighbor retrieval from a knowledge database), we build a simple and flexible visual memory that has the following key capabilities: (1.) The ability to flexibly add data across scales: from individual samples all the way to entire classes and billion-scale data; (2.) The ability to remove data through unlearning and memory pruning; (3.) An interpretable decision-mechanism on which we can intervene to control its behavior. Taken together, these capabilities comprehensively demonstrate the benefits of an explicit visual memory. We hope that it might contribute to a conversation on how knowledge should be represented in deep vision models -- beyond carving it in ``stone'' weights.</description>

      <title>Not Every Image is Worth a Thousand Words: Quantifying Originality in Stable Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of quantifying originality in text-to-image (T2I) generative diffusion models, with a focus on copyright originality. We begin by evaluating T2I models' ability to innovate and generalize through controlled experiments, revealing that stable diffusion models can effectively recreate unseen elements with sufficiently diverse training data. Then, our key insight is that concepts and combinations of image elements the model is familiar with, and saw more during training, are more concisly represented in the model's latent space. We hence propose a method that leverages textual inversion to measure the originality of an image based on the number of tokens required for its reconstruction by the model. Our approach is inspired by legal definitions of originality and aims to assess whether a model can produce original content without relying on specific prompts or having the training data of the model. We demonstrate our method using both a pre-trained stable diffusion model and a synthetic dataset, showing a correlation between the number of tokens and image originality. This work contributes to the understanding of originality in generative models and has implications for copyright infringement cases.</description>

      <title>Data-driven identification of latent port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional physics-based modeling techniques involve high effort, e.g., time and expert knowledge, while data-driven methods often lack interpretability, structure, and sometimes reliability. To mitigate this, we present a data-driven system identification framework that derives models in the port-Hamiltonian (pH) formulation. This formulation is suitable for multi-physical systems while guaranteeing the useful system theoretical properties of passivity and stability. Our framework combines linear and nonlinear reduction with structured, physics-motivated system identification. In this process, high-dimensional state data obtained from possibly nonlinear systems serves as input for an autoencoder, which then performs two tasks: (i) nonlinearly transforming and (ii) reducing this data onto a low-dimensional latent space. In this space, a linear pH system, that satisfies the pH properties per construction, is parameterized by the weights of a neural network. The mathematical requirements are met by defining the pH matrices through Cholesky factorizations. The neural networks that define the coordinate transformation and the pH system are identified in a joint optimization process to match the dynamics observed in the data while defining a linear pH system in the latent space. The learned, low-dimensional pH system can describe even nonlinear systems and is rapidly computable due to its small size. The method is exemplified by a parametric mass-spring-damper and a nonlinear pendulum example, as well as the high-dimensional model of a disc brake with linear thermoelastic behavior.</description>

      <title>Explaining an Agent's Future Beliefs through Temporally Decomposing Future Reward Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future reward estimation is a core component of reinforcement learning agents; i.e., Q-value and state-value functions, predicting an agent's sum of future rewards. Their scalar output, however, obfuscates when or what individual future rewards an agent may expect to receive. We address this by modifying an agent's future reward estimator to predict their next N expected rewards, referred to as Temporal Reward Decomposition (TRD). This unlocks novel explanations of agent behaviour. Through TRD we can: estimate when an agent may expect to receive a reward, the value of the reward and the agent's confidence in receiving it; measure an input feature's temporal importance to the agent's action decisions; and predict the influence of different actions on future rewards. Furthermore, we show that DQN agents trained on Atari environments can be efficiently retrained to incorporate TRD with minimal impact on performance.</description>

      <title>The Z-Gromov-Wasserstein Distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance is a powerful tool for comparing metric measure spaces which has found broad applications in data science and machine learning. Driven by the need to analyze datasets whose objects have increasingly complex structure (such as node and edge-attributed graphs), several variants of GW distance have been introduced in the recent literature. With a view toward establishing a general framework for the theory of GW-like distances, this paper considers a vast generalization of the notion of a metric measure space: for an arbitrary metric space $Z$, we define a $Z$-network to be a measure space endowed with a kernel valued in $Z$. We introduce a method for comparing $Z$-networks by defining a generalization of GW distance, which we refer to as $Z$-Gromov-Wasserstein ($Z$-GW) distance. This construction subsumes many previously known metrics and offers a unified approach to understanding their shared properties. The paper demonstrates that the $Z$-GW distance defines a metric on the space of $Z$-networks which retains desirable properties of $Z$, such as separability, completeness, and geodesicity. Many of these properties were unknown for existing variants of GW distance that fall under our framework. Our focus is on foundational theory, but our results also include computable lower bounds and approximations of the distance which will be useful for practical applications.</description>

      <title>A Conflicts-free, Speed-lossless KAN-based Reinforcement Learning Decision System for Interactive Driving in Roundabouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety and efficiency are crucial for autonomous driving in roundabouts, especially in the context of mixed traffic where autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles coexist. This paper introduces a learning-based algorithm tailored to foster safe and efficient driving behaviors across varying levels of traffic flows in roundabouts. The proposed algorithm employs a deep Q-learning network to effectively learn safe and efficient driving strategies in complex multi-vehicle roundabouts. Additionally, a KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold network) enhances the AVs' ability to learn their surroundings robustly and precisely. An action inspector is integrated to replace dangerous actions to avoid collisions when the AV interacts with the environment, and a route planner is proposed to enhance the driving efficiency and safety of the AVs. Moreover, a model predictive control is adopted to ensure stability and precision of the driving actions. The results show that our proposed system consistently achieves safe and efficient driving whilst maintaining a stable training process, as evidenced by the smooth convergence of the reward function and the low variance in the training curves across various traffic flows. Compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks, the proposed algorithm achieves a lower number of collisions and reduced travel time to destination.</description>

      <title>Snuffy: Efficient Whole Slide Image Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification with multiple instance learning (MIL) in digital pathology faces significant computational challenges. Current methods mostly rely on extensive self-supervised learning (SSL) for satisfactory performance, requiring long training periods and considerable computational resources. At the same time, no pre-training affects performance due to domain shifts from natural images to WSIs. We introduce \textbf{\textit{Snuffy}} architecture, a novel MIL-pooling method based on sparse transformers that mitigates performance loss with limited pre-training and enables continual few-shot pre-training as a competitive option. Our sparsity pattern is tailored for pathology and is theoretically proven to be a universal approximator with the tightest probabilistic sharp bound on the number of layers for sparse transformers, to date. We demonstrate Snuffy's effectiveness on CAMELYON16 and TCGA Lung cancer datasets, achieving superior WSI and patch-level accuracies.

      <title>InVAErt networks for amortized inference and identifiability analysis of lumped parameter hemodynamic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimation of cardiovascular model parameters from electronic health records (EHR) poses a significant challenge primarily due to lack of identifiability. Structural non-identifiability arises when a manifold in the space of parameters is mapped to a common output, while practical non-identifiability can result due to limited data, model misspecification, or noise corruption. To address the resulting ill-posed inverse problem, optimization-based or Bayesian inference approaches typically use regularization, thereby limiting the possibility of discovering multiple solutions. In this study, we use inVAErt networks, a neural network-based, data-driven framework for enhanced digital twin analysis of stiff dynamical systems. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of inVAErt networks in the context of physiological inversion of a six-compartment lumped parameter hemodynamic model from synthetic data to real data with missing components.</description>

      <title>Is Knowledge Power? On the (Im)possibility of Learning from Strategic Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When learning in strategic environments, a key question is whether agents can overcome uncertainty about their preferences to achieve outcomes they could have achieved absent any uncertainty. Can they do this solely through interactions with each other? We focus this question on the ability of agents to attain the value of their Stackelberg optimal strategy and study the impact of information asymmetry. We study repeated interactions in fully strategic environments where players' actions are decided based on learning algorithms that take into account their observed histories and knowledge of the game. We study the pure Nash equilibria (PNE) of a meta-game where players choose these algorithms as their actions. We demonstrate that if one player has perfect knowledge about the game, then any initial informational gap persists. That is, while there is always a PNE in which the informed agent achieves her Stackelberg value, there is a game where no PNE of the meta-game allows the partially informed player to achieve her Stackelberg value. On the other hand, if both players start with some uncertainty about the game, the quality of information alone does not determine which agent can achieve her Stackelberg value. In this case, the concept of information asymmetry becomes nuanced and depends on the game's structure. Overall, our findings suggest that repeated strategic interactions alone cannot facilitate learning effectively enough to earn an uninformed player her Stackelberg value.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Behavior Planning For Humanoid Loco-manipulation Through Grounded Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to perform autonomously loco-manipulation in unstructured environments is crucial and highly challenging for achieving embodied intelligence. This involves robots being able to plan their actions and behaviors in long-horizon tasks while using multi-modality to perceive deviations between task execution and high-level planning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful planning and reasoning capabilities for comprehension and processing of semantic information through robot control tasks, as well as the usability of analytical judgment and decision-making for multi-modal inputs. To leverage the power of LLMs towards humanoid loco-manipulation, we propose a novel language-model based framework that enables robots to autonomously plan behaviors and low-level execution under given textual instructions, while observing and correcting failures that may occur during task execution. To systematically evaluate this framework in grounding LLMs, we created the robot 'action' and 'sensing' behavior library for task planning, and conducted mobile manipulation tasks and experiments in both simulated and real environments using the CENTAURO robot, and verified the effectiveness and application of this approach in robotic tasks with autonomous behavioral planning.</description>

      <title>Accurate and efficient structure elucidation from routine one-dimensional NMR spectra using multitask machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid determination of molecular structures can greatly accelerate workflows across many chemical disciplines. However, elucidating structure using only one-dimensional (1D) NMR spectra, the most readily accessible data, remains an extremely challenging problem because of the combinatorial explosion of the number of possible molecules as the number of constituent atoms is increased. Here, we introduce a multitask machine learning framework that predicts the molecular structure (formula and connectivity) of an unknown compound solely based on its 1D 1H and/or 13C NMR spectra. First, we show how a transformer architecture can be constructed to efficiently solve the task, traditionally performed by chemists, of assembling large numbers of molecular fragments into molecular structures. Integrating this capability with a convolutional neural network (CNN), we build an end-to-end model for predicting structure from spectra that is fast and accurate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework on molecules with up to 19 heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms, a size for which there are trillions of possible structures. Without relying on any prior chemical knowledge such as the molecular formula, we show that our approach predicts the exact molecule 69.6% of the time within the first 15 predictions, reducing the search space by up to 11 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Aliasing and Label-Independent Decomposition of Risk: Beyond the bias-variance trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central problem in data science is to use potentially noisy samples of an unknown function to predict function values for unseen inputs. In classical statistics, the predictive error is understood as a trade-off between the bias and the variance that balances model simplicity with its ability to fit complex functions. However, over-parameterized models exhibit counter-intuitive behaviors, such as "double descent" in which models of increasing complexity exhibit decreasing generalization error. We introduce an alternative paradigm called the generalized aliasing decomposition. We explain the asymptotically small error of complex models as a systematic "de-aliasing" that occurs in the over-parameterized regime. In the limit of large models, the contribution due to aliasing vanishes, leaving an expression for the asymptotic total error we call the invertibility failure of very large models on few training points. Because the generalized aliasing decomposition can be explicitly calculated from the relationship between model class and samples without seeing any data labels, it can answer questions related to experimental design and model selection before collecting data or performing experiments. We demonstrate this approach using several examples, including classical regression problems and a cluster expansion model used in materials science.</description>

      <title>SLCA++: Unleash the Power of Sequential Fine-tuning for Continual Learning with Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, continual learning with pre-training (CLPT) has received widespread interest, instead of its traditional focus of training from scratch. The use of strong pre-trained models (PTMs) can greatly facilitate knowledge transfer and alleviate catastrophic forgetting, but also suffers from progressive overfitting of pre-trained knowledge into specific downstream tasks. A majority of current efforts often keep the PTMs frozen and incorporate task-specific prompts to instruct representation learning, coupled with a prompt selection process for inference. However, due to the limited capacity of prompt parameters, this strategy demonstrates only sub-optimal performance in continual learning. In comparison, tuning all parameters of PTMs often provides the greatest potential for representation learning, making sequential fine-tuning (Seq FT) a fundamental baseline that has been overlooked in CLPT. To this end, we present an in-depth analysis of the progressive overfitting problem from the lens of Seq FT. Considering that the overly fast representation learning and the biased classification layer constitute this particular problem, we introduce the advanced Slow Learner with Classifier Alignment (SLCA++) framework to unleash the power of Seq FT, serving as a strong baseline approach for CLPT. Our approach involves a Slow Learner to selectively reduce the learning rate of backbone parameters, and a Classifier Alignment to align the disjoint classification layers in a post-hoc fashion. We further enhance the efficacy of SL with a symmetric cross-entropy loss, as well as employ a parameter-efficient strategy to implement Seq FT with SLCA++. Across a variety of continual learning scenarios on image classification benchmarks, our approach provides substantial improvements and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

      <title>HELP: Hierarchical Embeddings-based Log Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logs are a first-hand source of information for software maintenance and failure diagnosis. Log parsing, which converts semi-structured log messages into structured templates, is a prerequisite for automated log analysis tasks such as anomaly detection, troubleshooting, and root cause analysis. However, existing log parsers fail in real-world systems for three main reasons. First, traditional heuristics-based parsers require handcrafted features and domain knowledge, which are difficult to generalize at scale. Second, existing large language model-based parsers rely on periodic offline processing, limiting their effectiveness in real-time use cases. Third, existing online parsing algorithms are susceptible to log drift, where slight log changes create false positives that drown out real anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose HELP, a Hierarchical Embeddings-based Log Parser. HELP is the first online semantic-based parser to leverage LLMs for performant and cost-effective log parsing. We achieve this through a novel hierarchical embeddings module, which fine-tunes a text embedding model to cluster logs before parsing, reducing querying costs by multiple orders of magnitude. To combat log drift, we also develop an iterative rebalancing module, which periodically updates existing log groupings. We evaluate HELP extensively on 14 public large-scale datasets, showing that HELP achieves significantly higher F1-weighted grouping and parsing accuracy than current state-of-the-art online log parsers. We also implement HELP into Iudex's production observability platform, confirming HELP's practicality in a production environment. Our results show that HELP is effective and efficient for high-throughput real-world log parsing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3, and Llama 3.1 in solving some selected undergraduate-level transportation engineering problems. We introduce TransportBench, a benchmark dataset that includes a sample of transportation engineering problems on a wide range of subjects in the context of planning, design, management, and control of transportation systems. This dataset is used by human experts to evaluate the capabilities of various commercial and open-sourced LLMs, especially their accuracy, consistency, and reasoning behaviors, in solving transportation engineering problems. Our comprehensive analysis uncovers the unique strengths and limitations of each LLM, e.g. our analysis shows the impressive accuracy and some unexpected inconsistent behaviors of Claude 3.5 Sonnet in solving TransportBench problems. Our study marks a thrilling first step toward harnessing artificial general intelligence for complex transportation challenges.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Load Forecasting Based on Adaptive Online Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.14721v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Load forecasting is crucial for multiple energy management tasks such as scheduling generation capacity, planning supply and demand, and minimizing energy trade costs. Such relevance has increased even more in recent years due to the integration of renewable energies, electric cars, and microgrids. Conventional load forecasting techniques obtain single-value load forecasts by exploiting consumption patterns of past load demand. However, such techniques cannot assess intrinsic uncertainties in load demand, and cannot capture dynamic changes in consumption patterns. To address these problems, this paper presents a method for probabilistic load forecasting based on the adaptive online learning of hidden Markov models. We propose learning and forecasting techniques with theoretical guarantees, and experimentally assess their performance in multiple scenarios. In particular, we develop adaptive online learning techniques that update model parameters recursively, and sequential prediction techniques that obtain probabilistic forecasts using the most recent parameters. The performance of the method is evaluated using multiple datasets corresponding with regions that have different sizes and display assorted time-varying consumption patterns. The results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of existing techniques for a wide range of scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While deep reinforcement learning (RL) has fueled multiple high-profile successes in machine learning, it is held back from more widespread adoption by its often poor data efficiency and the limited generality of the policies it produces. A promising approach for alleviating these limitations is to cast the development of better RL algorithms as a machine learning problem itself in a process called meta-RL. Meta-RL is most commonly studied in a problem setting where, given a distribution of tasks, the goal is to learn a policy that is capable of adapting to any new task from the task distribution with as little data as possible. In this survey, we describe the meta-RL problem setting in detail as well as its major variations. We discuss how, at a high level, meta-RL research can be clustered based on the presence of a task distribution and the learning budget available for each individual task. Using these clusters, we then survey meta-RL algorithms and applications. We conclude by presenting the open problems on the path to making meta-RL part of the standard toolbox for a deep RL practitioner.</description>

      <title>On Model Compression for Neural Networks: Framework, Algorithm, and Convergence Guarantee</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model compression is a crucial part of deploying neural networks (NNs), especially when the memory and storage of computing devices are limited in many applications. This paper focuses on two model compression techniques: low-rank approximation and weight pruning in neural networks, which are very popular nowadays. However, training NN with low-rank approximation and weight pruning always suffers significant accuracy loss and convergence issues. In this paper, a holistic framework is proposed for model compression from a novel perspective of nonconvex optimization by designing an appropriate objective function. Then, we introduce NN-BCD, a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to solve the nonconvex optimization. One advantage of our algorithm is that an efficient iteration scheme can be derived with closed-form, which is gradient-free. Therefore, our algorithm will not suffer from vanishing/exploding gradient problems. Furthermore, with the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (K{\L}) property of our objective function, we show that our algorithm globally converges to a critical point at the rate of O(1/k), where k denotes the number of iterations. Lastly, extensive experiments with tensor train decomposition and weight pruning demonstrate the efficiency and superior performance of the proposed framework. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ChenyangLi-97/NN-BCD</description>

      <title>Bottleneck Structure in Learned Features: Low-Dimension vs Regularity Tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous work has shown that DNNs with large depth $L$ and $L_{2}$-regularization are biased towards learning low-dimensional representations of the inputs, which can be interpreted as minimizing a notion of rank $R^{(0)}(f)$ of the learned function $f$, conjectured to be the Bottleneck rank. We compute finite depth corrections to this result, revealing a measure $R^{(1)}$ of regularity which bounds the pseudo-determinant of the Jacobian $\left|Jf(x)\right|_{+}$ and is subadditive under composition and addition. This formalizes a balance between learning low-dimensional representations and minimizing complexity/irregularity in the feature maps, allowing the network to learn the `right' inner dimension. Finally, we prove the conjectured bottleneck structure in the learned features as $L\to\infty$: for large depths, almost all hidden representations are approximately $R^{(0)}(f)$-dimensional, and almost all weight matrices $W_{\ell}$ have $R^{(0)}(f)$ singular values close to 1 while the others are $O(L^{-\frac{1}{2}})$. Interestingly, the use of large learning rates is required to guarantee an order $O(L)$ NTK which in turns guarantees infinite depth convergence of the representations of almost all layers.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scalarizations for Sublinear Hypervolume Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03288v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalarization is a general, parallizable technique that can be deployed in any multiobjective setting to reduce multiple objectives into one, yet some have dismissed this versatile approach because linear scalarizations cannot explore concave regions of the Pareto frontier. To that end, we aim to find simple non-linear scalarizations that provably explore a diverse set of $k$ objectives on the Pareto frontier, as measured by the dominated hypervolume. We show that hypervolume scalarizations with uniformly random weights achieves an optimal sublinear hypervolume regret bound of $O(T^{-1/k})$, with matching lower bounds that preclude any algorithm from doing better asymptotically. For the setting of multiobjective stochastic linear bandits, we utilize properties of hypervolume scalarizations to derive a novel non-Euclidean analysis to get regret bounds of $\tilde{O}( d T^{-1/2} + T^{-1/k})$, removing unnecessary $\text{poly}(k)$ dependencies. We support our theory with strong empirical performance of using non-linear scalarizations that outperforms both their linear counterparts and other standard multiobjective algorithms in a variety of natural settings.</description>

Abstract: Hamiltonian neural networks (HNNs) are state-of-the-art models that regress the vector field of a dynamical system under the learning bias of Hamilton's equations. A recent observation is that embedding a bias regarding the additive separability of the Hamiltonian reduces the regression complexity and improves regression performance. We propose separable HNNs that embed additive separability within HNNs using observational, learning, and inductive biases. We show that the proposed models are more effective than the HNN at regressing the Hamiltonian and the vector field. Consequently, the proposed models predict the dynamics and conserve the total energy of the Hamiltonian system more accurately.</description>

Abstract: While multi-task learning (MTL) has gained significant attention in recent years, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recent methods did not yield consistent performance improvements over single task learning (STL) baselines, underscoring the importance of gaining more profound insights about challenges specific to MTL. In our study, we investigate paradigms in MTL in the context of STL: First, the impact of the choice of optimizer has only been mildly investigated in MTL. We show the pivotal role of common STL tools such as the Adam optimizer in MTL empirically in various experiments. To further investigate Adam's effectiveness, we theoretical derive a partial loss-scale invariance under mild assumptions. Second, the notion of gradient conflicts has often been phrased as a specific problem in MTL. We delve into the role of gradient conflicts in MTL and compare it to STL. For angular gradient alignment we find no evidence that this is a unique problem in MTL. We emphasize differences in gradient magnitude as the main distinguishing factor. Overall, we find surprising similarities between STL and MTL suggesting to consider methods from both fields in a broader context.</description>

      <title>There is No Silver Bullet: Benchmarking Methods in Predictive Combinatorial Optimization</title>

Abstract: Predictive combinatorial optimization, where the parameters of combinatorial optimization (CO) are unknown at the decision-making time, is the precise modeling of many real-world applications, including energy cost-aware scheduling and budget allocation on advertising. Tackling such a problem usually involves a prediction model and a CO solver. These two modules are integrated into the predictive CO pipeline following two design principles: ``Predict-then-Optimize (PtO)'', which learns predictions by supervised training and subsequently solves CO using predicted coefficients, while the other, named ``Predict-and-Optimize (PnO)'', directly optimizes towards the ultimate decision quality and claims to yield better decisions than traditional PtO approaches. However, there lacks a systematic benchmark of both approaches, including the specific design choices at the module level, as well as an evaluation dataset that covers representative real-world scenarios. To this end, we develop a modular framework to benchmark 11 existing PtO/PnO methods on 8 problems, including a new industrial dataset for combinatorial advertising that will be released. Our study shows that PnO approaches are better than PtO on 7 out of 8 benchmarks, but there is no silver bullet found for the specific design choices of PnO. A comprehensive categorization of current approaches and integration of typical scenarios are provided under a unified benchmark. Therefore, this paper could serve as a comprehensive benchmark for future PnO approach development and also offer fast prototyping for application-focused development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When optimizing problems with uncertain parameter values in a linear objective, decision-focused learning enables end-to-end learning of these values. We are interested in a stochastic scheduling problem, in which processing times are uncertain, which brings uncertain values in the constraints, and thus repair of an initial schedule may be needed. Historical realizations of the stochastic processing times are available. We show how existing decision-focused learning techniques based on stochastic smoothing can be adapted to this scheduling problem. We include an extensive experimental evaluation to investigate in which situations decision-focused learning outperforms the state of the art for such situations: scenario-based stochastic optimization.</description>

      <title>A Distributed Privacy Preserving Model for the Detection of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Segmentation of medical data, concerns about personal health information (PHI) breaches, and the direct and indirect costs of consolidating and managing such segmented date should motivate diagnostic machine learning (DML) researchers to identify privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms that can train on distributed or decentralized datasets of different modalities. Federated learning models provide such a decentralized machine learning framework in which multiple investigators in possession of disparate datasets and working on different devices or servers can train collaboratively a global machine learning models without ever having to exchange local data and thus can meet statutory PHI protections. To this end, a vertical federate learning model is devised and tested for efficacy in the detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD).
  METHODS: The second version of Open Access Series of Imaging Studies -- with its panoply of demographic, imaging, and clinical assessment datasets -- was used to test a multimodal vertical federated learning (VFL) model for AD detection.
  RESULTS: By training and validating this VFL model on the demographic, clinical, and MRI data in OASIS-2, an 82.9\% accuracy rate is achieved, consistent with previously reported results.
  CONCLUSIONS: The VFL architecture proposed herein offers a novel distributed architecture, enabling collaborative learning across diverse sources of medical data while respecting statutory privacy constraints. By leveraging multiple modalities of data, the robustness and accuracy of AD detection can be enhanced. This model not only contributes to the advancement of federated learning techniques but also holds promise for overcoming the hurdles posed by data segmentation in medical research.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-enforcing neural networks with applications to constitutive modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of machine learning techniques to homogenize the effective behavior of arbitrary microstructures has been shown to be not only efficient but also accurate. In a recent work, we demonstrated how to combine state-of-the-art micromechanical modeling and advanced machine learning techniques to homogenize complex microstructures exhibiting non-linear and history dependent behaviors (Logarzo et al., 2021). The resulting homogenized model, termed smart constitutive law (SCL), enables the adoption of microstructurally informed constitutive laws into finite element solvers at a fraction of the computational cost required by traditional concurrent multiscale approaches. In this work, the capabilities of SCLs are expanded via the introduction of a novel methodology that enforces material symmetries at the neuron level, applicable across various neural network architectures. This approach utilizes tensor-based features in neural networks, facilitating the concise and accurate representation of symmetry-preserving operations, and is general enough to be extend to problems beyond constitutive modeling. Details on the construction of these tensor-based neural networks and their application in learning constitutive laws are presented for both elastic and inelastic materials. The superiority of this approach over traditional neural networks is demonstrated in scenarios with limited data and strong symmetries, through comprehensive testing on various materials, including isotropic neo-Hookean materials and tensegrity lattice metamaterials. This work is concluded by a discussion on the potential of this methodology to discover symmetry bases in materials and by an outline of future research directions.</description>

Abstract: Human choice prediction in economic contexts is crucial for applications in marketing, finance, public policy, and more. This task, however, is often constrained by the difficulties in acquiring human choice data. With most experimental economics studies focusing on simple choice settings, the AI community has explored whether LLMs can substitute for humans in these predictions and examined more complex experimental economics settings. However, a key question remains: can LLMs generate training data for human choice prediction? We explore this in language-based persuasion games, a complex economic setting involving natural language in strategic interactions. Our experiments show that models trained on LLM-generated data can effectively predict human behavior in these games and even outperform models trained on actual human data.</description>

      <title>Just Cluster It: An Approach for Exploration in High-Dimensions using Clustering and Pre-Trained Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we adopt a representation-centric perspective on exploration in reinforcement learning, viewing exploration fundamentally as a density estimation problem. We investigate the effectiveness of clustering representations for exploration in 3-D environments, based on the observation that the importance of pixel changes between transitions is less pronounced in 3-D environments compared to 2-D environments, where pixel changes between transitions are typically distinct and significant. We propose a method that performs episodic and global clustering on random representations and on pre-trained DINO representations to count states, i.e, estimate pseudo-counts. Surprisingly, even random features can be clustered effectively to count states in 3-D environments, however when these become visually more complex, pre-trained DINO representations are more effective thanks to the pre-trained inductive biases in the representations. Overall, this presents a pathway for integrating pre-trained biases into exploration. We evaluate our approach on the VizDoom and Habitat environments, demonstrating that our method surpasses other well-known exploration methods in these settings.</description>

      <title>Exact Tensor Completion Powered by Slim Transforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a tensor completion problem is studied, which aims to perfectly recover the tensor from partial observations. The existing theoretical guarantee requires the involved transform to be orthogonal, which hinders its applications. In this paper, jumping out of the constraints of isotropy and self-adjointness, the theoretical guarantee of exact tensor completion with arbitrary linear transforms is established by directly operating the tensors in the transform domain. With the enriched choices of transforms, a new analysis obtained by the proof discloses why slim transforms outperform their square counterparts from a theoretical level. Our model and proof greatly enhance the flexibility of tensor completion and extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Voice-Driven Mortality Prediction in Hospitalized Heart Failure Patients: A Machine Learning Approach Enhanced with Diagnostic Biomarkers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Addressing heart failure (HF) as a prevalent global health concern poses difficulties in implementing innovative approaches for enhanced patient care. Predicting mortality rates in HF patients, in particular, is difficult yet critical, necessitating individualized care, proactive management, and enabling educated decision-making to enhance outcomes. Recently, the significance of voice biomarkers coupled with Machine Learning (ML) has surged, demonstrating remarkable efficacy, particularly in predicting heart failure. The synergy of voice analysis and ML algorithms provides a non-invasive and easily accessible means to evaluate patients' health. However, there is a lack of voice biomarkers for predicting mortality rates among heart failure patients with standardized speech protocols. Here, we demonstrate a powerful and effective ML model for predicting mortality rates in hospitalized HF patients through the utilization of voice biomarkers. By seamlessly integrating voice biomarkers into routine patient monitoring, this strategy has the potential to improve patient outcomes, optimize resource allocation, and advance patient-centered HF management. In this study, a Machine Learning system, specifically a logistic regression model, is trained to predict patients' 5-year mortality rates using their speech as input. The model performs admirably and consistently, as demonstrated by cross-validation and statistical approaches (p-value &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, integrating NT-proBNP, a diagnostic biomarker in HF, improves the model's predictive accuracy substantially.</description>

      <title>Trained Random Forests Completely Reveal your Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an optimization-based reconstruction attack capable of completely or near-completely reconstructing a dataset utilized for training a random forest. Notably, our approach relies solely on information readily available in commonly used libraries such as scikit-learn. To achieve this, we formulate the reconstruction problem as a combinatorial problem under a maximum likelihood objective. We demonstrate that this problem is NP-hard, though solvable at scale using constraint programming -- an approach rooted in constraint propagation and solution-domain reduction. Through an extensive computational investigation, we demonstrate that random forests trained without bootstrap aggregation but with feature randomization are susceptible to a complete reconstruction. This holds true even with a small number of trees. Even with bootstrap aggregation, the majority of the data can also be reconstructed. These findings underscore a critical vulnerability inherent in widely adopted ensemble methods, warranting attention and mitigation. Although the potential for such reconstruction attacks has been discussed in privacy research, our study provides clear empirical evidence of their practicability.</description>

Abstract: Item Response Theory (IRT) models aim to assess latent abilities of $n$ examinees along with latent difficulty characteristics of $m$ test items from categorical data that indicates the quality of their corresponding answers. Classical psychometric assessments are based on a relatively small number of examinees and items, say a class of $200$ students solving an exam comprising $10$ problems. More recent global large scale assessments such as PISA, or internet studies, may lead to significantly increased numbers of participants. Additionally, in the context of Machine Learning where algorithms take the role of examinees and data analysis problems take the role of items, both $n$ and $m$ may become very large, challenging the efficiency and scalability of computations. To learn the latent variables in IRT models from large data, we leverage the similarity of these models to logistic regression, which can be approximated accurately using small weighted subsets called coresets. We develop coresets for their use in alternating IRT training algorithms, facilitating scalable learning from large data.</description>

      <title>Detecting Anomalies in Dynamic Graphs via Memory enhanced Normality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in dynamic graphs presents a significant challenge due to the temporal evolution of graph structures and attributes. The conventional approaches that tackle this problem typically employ an unsupervised learning framework, capturing normality patterns with exclusive normal data during training and identifying deviations as anomalies during testing. However, these methods face critical drawbacks: they either only depend on proxy tasks for representation without directly pinpointing normal patterns, or they neglect to differentiate between spatial and temporal normality patterns. More recent methods that use contrastive learning with negative sampling also face high computational costs, limiting their scalability to large graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Spatial-Temporal memories-enhanced graph autoencoder (STRIPE). Initially, STRIPE employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and gated temporal convolution layers to extract spatial and temporal features. Then STRIPE incorporates separate spatial and temporal memory networks to capture and store prototypes of normal patterns, respectively. These stored patterns are retrieved and integrated with encoded graph embeddings through a mutual attention mechanism. Finally, the integrated features are fed into the decoder to reconstruct the graph streams which serve as the proxy task for anomaly detection. This comprehensive approach not only minimizes reconstruction errors but also emphasizes the compactness and distinctiveness of the embeddings w.r.t. the nearest memory prototypes. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of STRIPE, where STRIPE significantly outperforms existing methods with 5.8% improvement in AUC scores and 4.62X faster in training time.</description>

      <title>The Model Openness Framework: Promoting Completeness and Openness for Reproducibility, Transparency, and Usability in Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13784v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI (GAI) offers unprecedented opportunities for research and innovation, but its commercialization has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open GAI models lack the necessary components for full understanding and reproducibility, and some use restrictive licenses whilst claiming to be ``open-source''. To address these concerns, we propose the Model Openness Framework (MOF), a ranked classification system that rates machine learning models based on their completeness and openness, following principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. The MOF requires specific components of the model development lifecycle to be included and released under appropriate open licenses. This framework aims to prevent misrepresentation of models claiming to be open, guide researchers and developers in providing all model components under permissive licenses, and help individuals and organizations identify models that can be safely adopted without restrictions. By promoting transparency and reproducibility, the MOF combats ``openwashing'' practices and establishes completeness and openness as primary criteria alongside the core tenets of responsible AI. Wide adoption of the MOF will foster a more open AI ecosystem, benefiting research, innovation, and adoption of state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Conditional Fairness for Generative AIs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16663v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment of generative AI (GenAI) models raises significant fairness concerns, addressed in this paper through novel characterization and enforcement techniques specific to GenAI. Unlike standard AI performing specific tasks, GenAI's broad functionality requires "conditional fairness" tailored to the context being generated, such as demographic fairness in generating images of poor people versus successful business leaders. We define two fairness levels: the first evaluates fairness in generated outputs, independent of prompts and models; the second assesses inherent fairness with neutral prompts. Given the complexity of GenAI and challenges in fairness specifications, we focus on bounding the worst case, considering a GenAI system unfair if the distance between appearances of a specific group exceeds preset thresholds. We also explore combinatorial testing for accessing relative completeness in intersectional fairness. By bounding the worst case, we develop a prompt injection scheme within an agent-based framework to enforce conditional fairness with minimal intervention, validated on state-of-the-art GenAI systems.</description>

Abstract: We propose training-free graph neural networks (TFGNNs), which can be used without training and can also be improved with optional training, for transductive node classification. We first advocate labels as features (LaF), which is an admissible but not explored technique. We show that LaF provably enhances the expressive power of graph neural networks. We design TFGNNs based on this analysis. In the experiments, we confirm that TFGNNs outperform existing GNNs in the training-free setting and converge with much fewer training iterations than traditional GNNs.</description>

      <title>Asymmetrical estimator for training encapsulated deep photonic neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalable isomorphic physical neural networks (PNNs) are emerging NN acceleration paradigms for their high-bandwidth, in-propagation computation. Despite backpropagation (BP)-based training is often the industry standard for its robustness and fast gradient convergences, existing BP-PNN training methods need to truncate the propagation of analogue signal at each layer and acquire accurate hidden neuron readouts for deep networks. This compromises the incentive of PNN for fast in-propagation processing. In addition, the required readouts introduce massive bottlenecks due to the conversions between the analogue-digital interfaces to shuttle information across. These factors limit both the time and energy efficiency during training. Here we introduce the asymmetrical training (AT) method, a BP-based method that can perform training on an encapsulated deep network, where the information propagation is maintained within the analogue domain until the output layer. AT's minimum information access bypass analogue-digital interface bottleneck wherever possible. For any deep network structure, AT offers significantly improved time and energy efficiency compared to existing BP-PNN methods, and scales well for large network sizes. We demonstrated AT's error-tolerant and calibration-free training for encapsulated integrated photonic deep networks to achieve near ideal BP performances. AT's well-behaved training is demonstrated repeatably across different datasets and network structures</description>

      <title>Enabling Regional Explainability by Automatic and Model-agnostic Rule Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17885v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Explainable AI, rule extraction translates model knowledge into logical rules, such as IF-THEN statements, crucial for understanding patterns learned by black-box models. This could significantly aid in fields like disease diagnosis, disease progression estimation, or drug discovery. However, such application domains often contain imbalanced data, with the class of interest underrepresented. Existing methods inevitably compromise the performance of rules for the minor class to maximise the overall performance. As the first attempt in this field, we propose a model-agnostic approach for extracting rules from specific subgroups of data, featuring automatic rule generation for numerical features. This method enhances the regional explainability of machine learning models and offers wider applicability compared to existing methods. We additionally introduce a new method for selecting features to compose rules, reducing computational costs in high-dimensional spaces. Experiments across various datasets and models demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</description>

      <title>SurvReLU: Inherently Interpretable Survival Analysis via Deep ReLU Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Survival analysis models time-to-event distributions with censorship. Recently, deep survival models using neural networks have dominated due to their representational power and state-of-the-art performance. However, their "black-box" nature hinders interpretability, which is crucial in real-world applications. In contrast, "white-box" tree-based survival models offer better interpretability but struggle to converge to global optima due to greedy expansion. In this paper, we bridge the gap between previous deep survival models and traditional tree-based survival models through deep rectified linear unit (ReLU) networks. We show that a deliberately constructed deep ReLU network (SurvReLU) can harness the interpretability of tree-based structures with the representational power of deep survival models. Empirical studies on both simulated and real survival benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed SurvReLU in terms of performance and interoperability. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/xs018/SurvReLU}{\color{magenta}{ https://github.com/xs018/SurvReLU}}.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning and Abstract Concepts: The Case of Natural Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrastive Learning (CL) has been successfully applied to classification and other downstream tasks related to concrete concepts, such as objects contained in the ImageNet dataset. No attempts seem to have been made so far in applying this promising scheme to more abstract entities. A prominent example of these could be the concept of (discrete) Quantity. CL can be frequently interpreted as a self-supervised scheme guided by some profound and ubiquitous conservation principle (e.g. conservation of identity in object classification tasks). In this introductory work we apply a suitable conservation principle to the semi-abstract concept of natural numbers by which discrete quantities can be estimated or predicted. We experimentally show, by means of a toy problem, that contrastive learning can be trained to count at a glance with high accuracy both at human as well as at super-human ranges.. We compare this with the results of a trained-to-count at a glance supervised learning (SL) neural network scheme of similar architecture. We show that both schemes exhibit similar good performance on baseline experiments, where the distributions of the training and testing stages are equal. Importantly, we demonstrate that in some generalization scenarios, where training and testing distributions differ, CL boasts more robust and much better error performance.</description>

      <title>A Non-negative VAE:the Generalized Gamma Belief Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gamma belief network (GBN), often regarded as a deep topic model, has demonstrated its potential for uncovering multi-layer interpretable latent representations in text data. Its notable capability to acquire interpretable latent factors is partially attributed to sparse and non-negative gamma-distributed latent variables. However, the existing GBN and its variations are constrained by the linear generative model, thereby limiting their expressiveness and applicability. To address this limitation, we introduce the generalized gamma belief network (Generalized GBN) in this paper, which extends the original linear generative model to a more expressive non-linear generative model. Since the parameters of the Generalized GBN no longer possess an analytic conditional posterior, we further propose an upward-downward Weibull inference network to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent variables. The parameters of both the generative model and the inference network are jointly trained within the variational inference framework. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on both expressivity and disentangled representation learning tasks to evaluate the performance of the Generalized GBN against state-of-the-art Gaussian variational autoencoders serving as baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning is often used in environments with many unverified participants. Therefore, federated learning under adversarial attacks receives significant attention. This paper proposes an algorithmic framework for list-decodable federated learning, where a central server maintains a list of models, with at least one guaranteed to perform well. The framework has no strict restriction on the fraction of honest workers, extending the applicability of Byzantine federated learning to the scenario with more than half adversaries. Under proper assumptions on the loss function, we prove a convergence theorem for our method. Experimental results, including image classification tasks with both convex and non-convex losses, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can withstand the malicious majority under various attacks.</description>

      <title>MathBridge: A Large Corpus Dataset for Translating Spoken Mathematical Expressions into $LaTeX$ Formulas for Improved Readability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding sentences that contain mathematical expressions in text form poses significant challenges. To address this, the importance of converting these expressions into a compiled formula is highlighted. For instance, the expression ``x equals minus b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four a c, all over two a'' from automatic speech recognition (ASR) is more readily comprehensible when displayed as a compiled formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. To develop a text-to-formula conversion system, we can break down the process into text-to-LaTeX and LaTeX-to-formula conversions, with the latter managed by various existing LaTeX engines. However, the former approach has been notably hindered by the severe scarcity of text-to-LaTeX paired data, which presents a significant challenge in this field. In this context, we introduce MathBridge, the first extensive dataset for translating mathematical spoken expressions into LaTeX, to establish a robust baseline for future research on text-to-LaTeX translation. MathBridge comprises approximately 23 million LaTeX formulas paired with the corresponding spoken English expressions. Through comprehensive evaluations, including fine-tuning and testing with data, we discovered that MathBridge significantly enhances the capabilities of pretrained language models for text-to-LaTeX translation. Specifically, for the T5-large model, the sacreBLEU score increased from 4.77 to 46.8, demonstrating substantial enhancement. Our findings indicate the need for a new metric, specifically for text-to-LaTeX conversion evaluations.</description>

      <title>Robust Active Learning (RoAL): Countering Dynamic Adversaries in Active Learning with Elastic Weight Consolidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in active learning and adversarial attacks, the intersection of these two fields remains underexplored, particularly in developing robust active learning frameworks against dynamic adversarial threats. The challenge of developing robust active learning frameworks under dynamic adversarial attacks is critical, as these attacks can lead to catastrophic forgetting within the active learning cycle. This paper introduces Robust Active Learning (RoAL), a novel approach designed to address this issue by integrating Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) into the active learning process. Our contributions are threefold: First, we propose a new dynamic adversarial attack that poses significant threats to active learning frameworks. Second, we introduce a novel method that combines EWC with active learning to mitigate catastrophic forgetting caused by dynamic adversarial attacks. Finally, we conduct extensive experimental evaluations to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The results show that RoAL not only effectively counters dynamic adversarial threats but also significantly reduces the impact of catastrophic forgetting, thereby enhancing the robustness and performance of active learning systems in adversarial environments.</description>

Abstract: Model merging is an efficient empowerment technique in the machine learning community that does not require the collection of raw training data and does not require expensive computation. As model merging becomes increasingly prevalent across various fields, it is crucial to understand the available model merging techniques comprehensively. However, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding a systematic and thorough review of these techniques. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of model merging methods and theories, their applications in various domains and settings, and future research directions. Specifically, we first propose a new taxonomic approach that exhaustively discusses existing model merging methods. Secondly, we discuss the application of model merging techniques in large language models, multimodal large language models, and 10+ machine learning subfields, including continual learning, multi-task learning, few-shot learning, etc. Finally, we highlight the remaining challenges of model merging and discuss future research directions. A comprehensive list of papers about model merging is available at \url{https://github.com/EnnengYang/Awesome-Model-Merging-Methods-Theories-Applications}.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning: a Heuristic Three-stage Mechanism for Grid Searches to Optimize the Future Risk Prediction of Breast Cancer Metastasis Using EHR-based Clinical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A grid search, at the cost of training and testing a large number of models, is an effective way to optimize the prediction performance of deep learning models. A challenging task concerning grid search is the time management. Without a good time management scheme, a grid search can easily be set off as a mission that will not finish in our lifetime. In this study, we introduce a heuristic three-stage mechanism for managing the running time of low-budget grid searches, and the sweet-spot grid search (SSGS) and randomized grid search (RGS) strategies for improving model prediction performance, in predicting the 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year risk of breast cancer metastasis. We develop deep feedforward neural network (DFNN) models and optimize them through grid searches. We conduct eight cycles of grid searches by applying our three-stage mechanism and SSGS and RGS strategies. We conduct various SHAP analyses including unique ones that interpret the importance of the DFNN-model hyperparameters. Our results show that grid search can greatly improve model prediction. The grid searches we conducted improved the risk prediction of 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year breast cancer metastasis by 18.6%, 16.3%, and 17.3% respectively, over the average performance of all corresponding models we trained using the RGS strategy. We not only demonstrate best model performance but also characterize grid searches from various aspects such as their capabilities of discovering decent models and the unit grid search time. The three-stage mechanism worked effectively. It made our low-budget grid searches feasible and manageable, and in the meantime helped improve model prediction performance. Our SHAP analyses identified both clinical risk factors important for the prediction of future risk of breast cancer metastasis, and DFNN-model hyperparameters important to the prediction of performance scores.</description>

      <title>Inferring Effect Ordering Without Causal Effect Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.12532v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictive models are often employed to guide interventions across various domains, such as advertising, customer retention, and personalized medicine. These models often do not estimate the actual effects of interventions but serve as proxies, suggesting potential effectiveness based on predicted outcomes. Our paper addresses the critical question of when and how these predictive models can be interpreted causally, specifically focusing on using the models for inferring effect ordering rather than precise effect sizes. We formalize two assumptions, full latent mediation and latent monotonicity, that are jointly sufficient for inferring effect ordering without direct causal effect estimation. We explore the utility of these assumptions in assessing the feasibility of proxies for inferring effect ordering in scenarios where there is no data on how individuals behave when intervened or no data on the primary outcome of interest. Additionally, we provide practical guidelines for practitioners to make their own assessments about proxies. Our findings reveal not only when it is possible to reasonably infer effect ordering from proxies, but also conditions under which modeling these proxies can outperform direct effect estimation. This study underscores the importance of broadening causal inference to encompass alternative causal interpretations beyond effect estimation, offering a foundation for future research to enhance decision-making processes when direct effect estimation is not feasible.</description>

      <title>Safe Imitation Learning of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Flexible Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flexible robots may overcome some of the industry's major challenges, such as enabling intrinsically safe human-robot collaboration and achieving a higher payload-to-mass ratio. However, controlling flexible robots is complicated due to their complex dynamics, which include oscillatory behavior and a high-dimensional state space. Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) offers an effective means to control such robots, but its significant computational demand often limits its application in real-time scenarios. To enable fast control of flexible robots, we propose a framework for a safe approximation of NMPC using imitation learning and a predictive safety filter. Our framework significantly reduces computation time while incurring a slight loss in performance. Compared to NMPC, our framework shows more than an eightfold improvement in computation time when controlling a three-dimensional flexible robot arm in simulation, all while guaranteeing safety constraints. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods. The development of fast and safe approximate NMPC holds the potential to accelerate the adoption of flexible robots in industry. The project code is available at: tinyurl.com/anmpc4fr</description>

      <title>Depth Degeneracy in Neural Networks: Vanishing Angles in Fully Connected ReLU Networks on Initialization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite remarkable performance on a variety of tasks, many properties of deep neural networks are not yet theoretically understood. One such mystery is the depth degeneracy phenomenon: the deeper you make your network, the closer your network is to a constant function on initialization. In this paper, we examine the evolution of the angle between two inputs to a ReLU neural network as a function of the number of layers. By using combinatorial expansions, we find precise formulas for how fast this angle goes to zero as depth increases. These formulas capture microscopic fluctuations that are not visible in the popular framework of infinite width limits, and leads to qualitatively different predictions. We validate our theoretical results with Monte Carlo experiments and show that our results accurately approximate finite network behaviour. \review{We also empirically investigate how the depth degeneracy phenomenon can negatively impact training of real networks.} The formulas are given in terms of the mixed moments of correlated Gaussians passed through the ReLU function. We also find a surprising combinatorial connection between these mixed moments and the Bessel numbers that allows us to explicitly evaluate these moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The autonomous driving community has witnessed a rapid growth in approaches that embrace an end-to-end algorithm framework, utilizing raw sensor input to generate vehicle motion plans, instead of concentrating on individual tasks such as detection and motion prediction. End-to-end systems, in comparison to modular pipelines, benefit from joint feature optimization for perception and planning. This field has flourished due to the availability of large-scale datasets, closed-loop evaluation, and the increasing need for autonomous driving algorithms to perform effectively in challenging scenarios. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of more than 270 papers, covering the motivation, roadmap, methodology, challenges, and future trends in end-to-end autonomous driving. We delve into several critical challenges, including multi-modality, interpretability, causal confusion, robustness, and world models, amongst others. Additionally, we discuss current advancements in foundation models and visual pre-training, as well as how to incorporate these techniques within the end-to-end driving framework. we maintain an active repository that contains up-to-date literature and open-source projects at https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/End-to-end-Autonomous-Driving.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustering is an important tool for data exploration where the goal is to subdivide a data set into disjoint clusters that fit well into the underlying data structure. When dealing with sensitive data, privacy-preserving algorithms aim to approximate the non-private baseline while minimising the leakage of sensitive information. State-of-the-art privacy-preserving clustering algorithms tend to output clusters that are good in terms of the standard metrics, inertia, silhouette score, and clustering accuracy, however, the clustering result strongly deviates from the non-private KMeans baseline. In this work, we present a privacy-preserving clustering algorithm called \DPM that recursively separates a data set into clusters based on a geometrical clustering approach. In addition, \DPM estimates most of the data-dependent hyper-parameters in a privacy-preserving way. We prove that \DPM preserves Differential Privacy and analyse the utility guarantees of \DPM. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation for synthetic and real-life data sets. We show that \DPM achieves state-of-the-art utility on the standard clustering metrics and yields a clustering result much closer to that of the popular non-private KMeans algorithm without requiring the number of classes.</description>

      <title>CoTFormer: A Chain-of-Thought Driven Architecture with Budget-Adaptive Computation Cost at Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling language models to larger and deeper sizes has led to significant boosts in performance. Even though the size of these models limits their application in compute-constrained environments, the race to continually develop ever larger and deeper foundational models is underway. At the same time -- regardless of the model size -- task-specific techniques continue to play a pivotal role in achieving optimal downstream performance. One of these techniques, called Chain-of-Thought (CoT), is particularly interesting since, as we point out in this work, it resembles employing a deeper transformer through re-applying the model multiple times. However, a key subtlety in computing the attention of past tokens differentiates CoT from simply applying the model several times. Based on this insight, we propose CoTFormer, a novel architecture which closely mimics CoT at the token level, allowing us to obtain significantly improved accuracies close to much larger models. While applying CoT introduces additional computation costs, we compensate for it by leveraging CoTFormer's special compatibility with token-wise variable depth. Through a compute adaptive model -- which automatically allocates the compute to tokens that need it most -- we show that it is possible to reduce the computation cost significantly without any reduction in accuracy, and with further compute cost reductions possible while maintaining a competitive accuracy.</description>

      <title>QECO: A QoE-Oriented Computation Offloading Algorithm based on Deep Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of mobile edge computing (MEC), efficient computation task offloading plays a pivotal role in ensuring a seamless quality of experience (QoE) for users. Maintaining a high QoE is paramount in today's interconnected world, where users demand reliable services. This challenge stands as one of the most primary key factors contributing to handling dynamic and uncertain mobile environment. In this study, we delve into computation offloading in MEC systems, where strict task processing deadlines and energy constraints can adversely affect the system performance. We formulate the computation task offloading problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) to maximize the long-term QoE of each user individually. We propose a distributed QoE-oriented computation offloading (QECO) algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that empowers mobile devices to make their offloading decisions without requiring knowledge of decisions made by other devices. Through numerical studies, we evaluate the performance of QECO. Simulation results validate that QECO efficiently exploits the computational resources of edge nodes. Consequently, it can complete 14\% more tasks and reduce task delay and energy consumption by 9% and 6%, respectively. These together contribute to a significant improvement of at least 37\% in average QoE compared to an existing algorithm.</description>

      <title>Evetac: An Event-based Optical Tactile Sensor for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical tactile sensors have recently become popular. They provide high spatial resolution, but struggle to offer fine temporal resolutions. To overcome this shortcoming, we study the idea of replacing the RGB camera with an event-based camera and introduce a new event-based optical tactile sensor called Evetac. Along with hardware design, we develop touch processing algorithms to process its measurements online at 1000 Hz. We devise an efficient algorithm to track the elastomer's deformation through the imprinted markers despite the sensor's sparse output. Benchmarking experiments demonstrate Evetac's capabilities of sensing vibrations up to 498 Hz, reconstructing shear forces, and significantly reducing data rates compared to RGB optical tactile sensors. Moreover, Evetac's output and the marker tracking provide meaningful features for learning data-driven slip detection and prediction models. The learned models form the basis for a robust and adaptive closed-loop grasp controller capable of handling a wide range of objects. We believe that fast and efficient event-based tactile sensors like Evetac will be essential for bringing human-like manipulation capabilities to robotics. The sensor design is open-sourced at https://sites.google.com/view/evetac .</description>

      <title>A Semantic Space is Worth 256 Language Descriptions: Make Stronger Segmentation Models with Descriptive Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13764v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces ProLab, a novel approach using property-level label space for creating strong interpretable segmentation models. Instead of relying solely on category-specific annotations, ProLab uses descriptive properties grounded in common sense knowledge for supervising segmentation models. It is based on two core designs. First, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) and carefully crafted prompts to generate descriptions of all involved categories that carry meaningful common sense knowledge and follow a structured format. Second, we introduce a description embedding model preserving semantic correlation across descriptions and then cluster them into a set of descriptive properties (e.g., 256) using K-Means. These properties are based on interpretable common sense knowledge consistent with theories of human recognition. We empirically show that our approach makes segmentation models perform stronger on five classic benchmarks (e.g., ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, Pascal Context, Cityscapes, and BDD). Our method also shows better scalability with extended training steps than category-level supervision. Our interpretable segmentation framework also emerges with the generalization ability to segment out-of-domain or unknown categories using only in-domain descriptive properties.

      <title>Identifying Important Group of Pixels using Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To better understand the behavior of image classifiers, it is useful to visualize the contribution of individual pixels to the model prediction. In this study, we propose a method, MoXI ($\textbf{Mo}$del e$\textbf{X}$planation by $\textbf{I}$nteractions), that efficiently and accurately identifies a group of pixels with high prediction confidence. The proposed method employs game-theoretic concepts, Shapley values and interactions, taking into account the effects of individual pixels and the cooperative influence of pixels on model confidence. Theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that our method better identifies the pixels that are highly contributing to the model outputs than widely-used visualization by Grad-CAM, Attention rollout, and Shapley value. While prior studies have suffered from the exponential computational cost in the computation of Shapley value and interactions, we show that this can be reduced to quadratic cost for our task. The code is available at https://github.com/KosukeSumiyasu/MoXI.</description>

      <title>A Study on Large Language Models' Limitations in Multiple-Choice Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become commonplace, particularly with the emergence of open-source models. More importantly, smaller models are well-suited for integration into consumer devices and are frequently employed either as standalone solutions or as subroutines in various AI tasks. Despite their ubiquitous use, there is no systematic analysis of their specific capabilities and limitations. In this study, we tackle one of the most widely used tasks - answering Multiple Choice Question (MCQ). We analyze 26 small open-source models and find that 65% of the models do not understand the task, only 4 models properly select an answer from the given choices, and only 5 of these models are choice order independent. These results are rather alarming given the extensive use of MCQ tests with these models. We recommend exercising caution and testing task understanding before using MCQ to evaluate LLMs in any field whatsoever.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Uncertainty and Calibration on Likelihood-Ratio Membership Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a membership inference attack (MIA), an attacker exploits the overconfidence exhibited by typical machine learning models to determine whether a specific data point was used to train a target model. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the state-of-the-art likelihood ratio attack (LiRA) within an information-theoretical framework that allows the investigation of the impact of the aleatoric uncertainty in the true data generation process, of the epistemic uncertainty caused by a limited training data set, and of the calibration level of the target model. We compare three different settings, in which the attacker receives decreasingly informative feedback from the target model: confidence vector (CV) disclosure, in which the output probability vector is released; true label confidence (TLC) disclosure, in which only the probability assigned to the true label is made available by the model; and decision set (DS) disclosure, in which an adaptive prediction set is produced as in conformal prediction. We derive bounds on the advantage of an MIA adversary with the aim of offering insights into the impact of uncertainty and calibration on the effectiveness of MIAs. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived analytical bounds predict well the effectiveness of MIAs.</description>

      <title>Label Dropout: Improved Deep Learning Echocardiography Segmentation Using Multiple Datasets With Domain Shift and Partial Labelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Echocardiography (echo) is the first imaging modality used when assessing cardiac function. The measurement of functional biomarkers from echo relies upon the segmentation of cardiac structures and deep learning models have been proposed to automate the segmentation process. However, in order to translate these tools to widespread clinical use it is important that the segmentation models are robust to a wide variety of images (e.g. acquired from different scanners, by operators with different levels of expertise etc.). To achieve this level of robustness it is necessary that the models are trained with multiple diverse datasets. A significant challenge faced when training with multiple diverse datasets is the variation in label presence, i.e. the combined data are often partially-labelled. Adaptations of the cross entropy loss function have been proposed to deal with partially labelled data. In this paper we show that training naively with such a loss function and multiple diverse datasets can lead to a form of shortcut learning, where the model associates label presence with domain characteristics, leading to a drop in performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel label dropout scheme to break the link between domain characteristics and the presence or absence of labels. We demonstrate that label dropout improves echo segmentation Dice score by 62% and 25% on two cardiac structures when training using multiple diverse partially labelled datasets.</description>

      <title>PlainMamba: Improving Non-Hierarchical Mamba in Visual Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present PlainMamba: a simple non-hierarchical state space model (SSM) designed for general visual recognition. The recent Mamba model has shown how SSMs can be highly competitive with other architectures on sequential data and initial attempts have been made to apply it to images. In this paper, we further adapt the selective scanning process of Mamba to the visual domain, enhancing its ability to learn features from two-dimensional images by (i) a continuous 2D scanning process that improves spatial continuity by ensuring adjacency of tokens in the scanning sequence, and (ii) direction-aware updating which enables the model to discern the spatial relations of tokens by encoding directional information. Our architecture is designed to be easy to use and easy to scale, formed by stacking identical PlainMamba blocks, resulting in a model with constant width throughout all layers. The architecture is further simplified by removing the need for special tokens. We evaluate PlainMamba on a variety of visual recognition tasks, achieving performance gains over previous non-hierarchical models and is competitive with hierarchical alternatives. For tasks requiring high-resolution inputs, in particular, PlainMamba requires much less computing while maintaining high performance.

      <title>Characterizing Multimodal Long-form Summarization: A Case Study on Financial Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) expand the power of natural language processing to handle long inputs, rigorous and systematic analyses are necessary to understand their abilities and behavior. A salient application is summarization, due to its ubiquity and controversy (e.g., researchers have declared the death of summarization). In this paper, we use financial report summarization as a case study because financial reports are not only long but also use numbers and tables extensively. We propose a computational framework for characterizing multimodal long-form summarization and investigate the behavior of Claude 2.0/2.1, GPT-4/3.5, and Cohere. We find that GPT-3.5 and Cohere fail to perform this summarization task meaningfully. For Claude 2 and GPT-4, we analyze the extractiveness of the summary and identify a position bias in LLMs. This position bias disappears after shuffling the input for Claude, which suggests that Claude seems to recognize important information. We also conduct a comprehensive investigation on the use of numeric data in LLM-generated summaries and offer a taxonomy of numeric hallucination. We employ prompt engineering to improve GPT-4's use of numbers with limited success. Overall, our analyses highlight the strong capability of Claude 2 in handling long multimodal inputs compared to GPT-4. The generated summaries and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/ChicagoHAI/characterizing-multimodal-long-form-summarization.</description>

      <title>Compressed Federated Reinforcement Learning with a Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently gained unprecedented popularity, yet it still grapples with sample inefficiency. Addressing this challenge, federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) has emerged, wherein agents collaboratively learn a single policy by aggregating local estimations. However, this aggregation step incurs significant communication costs. In this paper, we propose CompFedRL, a communication-efficient FedRL approach incorporating both \textit{periodic aggregation} and (direct/error-feedback) compression mechanisms. Specifically, we consider compressed federated $Q$-learning with a generative model setup, where a central server learns an optimal $Q$-function by periodically aggregating compressed $Q$-estimates from local agents. For the first time, we characterize the impact of these two mechanisms (which have remained elusive) by providing a finite-time analysis of our algorithm, demonstrating strong convergence behaviors when utilizing either direct or error-feedback compression. Our bounds indicate improved solution accuracy concerning the number of agents and other federated hyperparameters while simultaneously reducing communication costs. To corroborate our theory, we also conduct in-depth numerical experiments to verify our findings, considering Top-$K$ and Sparsified-$K$ sparsification operators.</description>

      <title>Formally Verifying Deep Reinforcement Learning Controllers with Lyapunov Barrier Certificates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a powerful machine learning paradigm for generating agents that control autonomous systems. However, the ``black box'' nature of DRL agents limits their deployment in real-world safety-critical applications. A promising approach for providing strong guarantees on an agent's behavior is to use Neural Lyapunov Barrier (NLB) certificates, which are learned functions over the system whose properties indirectly imply that an agent behaves as desired. However, NLB-based certificates are typically difficult to learn and even more difficult to verify, especially for complex systems. In this work, we present a novel method for training and verifying NLB-based certificates for discrete-time systems. Specifically, we introduce a technique for certificate composition, which simplifies the verification of highly-complex systems by strategically designing a sequence of certificates. When jointly verified with neural network verification engines, these certificates provide a formal guarantee that a DRL agent both achieves its goals and avoids unsafe behavior. Furthermore, we introduce a technique for certificate filtering, which significantly simplifies the process of producing formally verified certificates. We demonstrate the merits of our approach with a case study on providing safety and liveness guarantees for a DRL-controlled spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Innovations for Underwater Waste Detection: An In-Depth Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addressing the issue of submerged underwater trash is crucial for safeguarding aquatic ecosystems and preserving marine life. While identifying debris present on the surface of water bodies is straightforward, assessing the underwater submerged waste is a challenge due to the image distortions caused by factors such as light refraction, absorption, suspended particles, color shifts, and occlusion. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art architectures and on the existing datasets to establish a baseline for submerged waste and trash detection. The primary goal remains to establish the benchmark of the object localization techniques to be leveraged by advanced underwater sensors and autonomous underwater vehicles. The ultimate objective is to explore the underwater environment, to identify, and remove underwater debris. The absence of benchmarks (dataset or algorithm) in many researches emphasizes the need for a more robust algorithmic solution. Through this research, we aim to give performance comparative analysis of various underwater trash detection algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Traditionally in the domain of legal research, the retrieval of pertinent citations from intricate case descriptions has demanded manual effort and keyword-based search applications that mandate expertise in understanding legal jargon. Legal case descriptions hold pivotal information for legal professionals and researchers, necessitating more efficient and automated approaches. We propose a methodology that combines natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to enhance the organization and utilization of legal case descriptions. This approach revolves around the creation of textual embeddings with the help of state-of-art embedding models. Our methodology addresses two primary objectives: unsupervised clustering and supervised citation retrieval, both designed to automate the citation extraction process. Although the proposed methodology can be used for any dataset, we employed the Supreme Court of The United States (SCOTUS) dataset, yielding remarkable results. Our methodology achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 90.9%. By automating labor-intensive processes, we pave the way for a more efficient, time-saving, and accessible landscape in legal research, benefiting legal professionals, academics, and researchers.</description>

      <title>EUvsDisinfo: a Dataset for Multilingual Detection of Pro-Kremlin Disinformation in News Articles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces EUvsDisinfo, a multilingual dataset of trustworthy and disinformation articles related to pro-Kremlin themes. It is sourced directly from the debunk articles written by experts leading the EUvsDisinfo project. Our dataset is the largest to-date resource in terms of the overall number of articles and distinct languages. It also provides the largest topical and temporal coverage. Using this dataset, we investigate the dissemination of pro-Kremlin disinformation across different languages, uncovering language-specific patterns targeting specific disinformation topics. We further analyse the evolution of topic distribution over an eight-year period, noting a significant surge in disinformation content before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Lastly, we demonstrate the dataset's applicability in training models to effectively distinguish between disinformation and trustworthy content in multilingual settings.</description>

      <title>Low-latency machine learning FPGA accelerator for multi-qubit-state discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring a qubit state is a fundamental yet error-prone operation in quantum computing. These errors can arise from various sources, such as crosstalk, spontaneous state transitions, and excitations caused by the readout pulse. Here, we utilize an integrated approach to deploy neural networks onto field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA). We demonstrate that implementing a fully connected neural network accelerator for multi-qubit readout is advantageous, balancing computational complexity with low latency requirements without significant loss in accuracy. The neural network is implemented by quantizing weights, activation functions, and inputs. The hardware accelerator performs frequency-multiplexed readout of five superconducting qubits in less than 50 ns on a radio frequency system on chip (RFSoC) ZCU111 FPGA, marking the advent of RFSoC-based low-latency multi-qubit readout using neural networks. These modules can be implemented and integrated into existing quantum control and readout platforms, making the RFSoC ZCU111 ready for experimental deployment.</description>

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) encompasses the task of monitoring human activities across various domains, including but not limited to medical, educational, entertainment, visual surveillance, video retrieval, and the identification of anomalous activities. Over the past decade, the field of HAR has witnessed substantial progress by leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to effectively extract and comprehend intricate information, thereby enhancing the overall performance of HAR systems. Recently, the domain of computer vision has witnessed the emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) as a potent solution. The efficacy of transformer architecture has been validated beyond the confines of image analysis, extending their applicability to diverse video-related tasks. Notably, within this landscape, the research community has shown keen interest in HAR, acknowledging its manifold utility and widespread adoption across various domains. This article aims to present an encompassing survey that focuses on CNNs and the evolution of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to ViTs given their importance in the domain of HAR. By conducting a thorough examination of existing literature and exploring emerging trends, this study undertakes a critical analysis and synthesis of the accumulated knowledge in this field. Additionally, it investigates the ongoing efforts to develop hybrid approaches. Following this direction, this article presents a novel hybrid model that seeks to integrate the inherent strengths of CNNs and ViTs.</description>

      <title>The Power of Combining Data and Knowledge: GPT-4o is an Effective Interpreter of Machine Learning Models in Predicting Lymph Node Metastasis of Lung Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17900v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is a crucial factor in determining the initial treatment for patients with lung cancer, yet accurate preoperative diagnosis of LNM remains challenging. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their remarkable text generation capabilities. Leveraging the extensive medical knowledge learned from vast corpora, LLMs can estimate probabilities for clinical problems, though their performance has historically been inferior to data-driven machine learning models. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble method that combines the medical knowledge acquired by LLMs with the latent patterns identified by machine learning models to enhance LNM prediction performance. Initially, we developed machine learning models using patient data. We then designed a prompt template to integrate the patient data with the predicted probability from the machine learning model. Subsequently, we instructed GPT-4o, the most advanced LLM developed by OpenAI, to estimate the likelihood of LNM based on patient data and then adjust the estimate using the machine learning output. Finally, we collected three outputs from the GPT-4o using the same prompt and ensembled these results as the final prediction. Using the proposed method, our models achieved an AUC value of 0.778 and an AP value of 0.426 for LNM prediction, significantly improving predictive performance compared to baseline machine learning models. The experimental results indicate that GPT-4o can effectively leverage its medical knowledge and the probabilities predicted by machine learning models to achieve more accurate LNM predictions. These findings demonstrate that LLMs can perform well in clinical risk prediction tasks, offering a new paradigm for integrating medical knowledge and patient data in clinical predictions.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Emotion Recognition using Audio-Video Transformer Fusion with Cross Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding emotions is a fundamental aspect of human communication. Integrating audio and video signals offers a more comprehensive understanding of emotional states compared to traditional methods that rely on a single data source, such as speech or facial expressions. Despite its potential, multimodal emotion recognition faces significant challenges, particularly in synchronization, feature extraction, and fusion of diverse data sources. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel transformer-based model named Audio-Video Transformer Fusion with Cross Attention (AVT-CA). The AVT-CA model employs a transformer fusion approach to effectively capture and synchronize interlinked features from both audio and video inputs, thereby resolving synchronization problems. Additionally, the Cross Attention mechanism within AVT-CA selectively extracts and emphasizes critical features while discarding irrelevant ones from both modalities, addressing feature extraction and fusion challenges. Extensive experimental analysis conducted on the CMU-MOSEI, RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed model. The results underscore the importance of AVT-CA in developing precise and reliable multimodal emotion recognition systems for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Decentralized and Uncoordinated Learning of Stable Matchings: A Game-Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning stable matchings with unknown preferences in a decentralized and uncoordinated manner, where "decentralized" means that players make decisions individually without the influence of a central platform, and "uncoordinated" means that players do not need to synchronize their decisions using pre-specified rules. First, we provide a game formulation for this problem with known preferences, where the set of pure Nash equilibria (NE) coincides with the set of stable matchings, and mixed NE can be rounded to a stable matching. Then, we show that for hierarchical markets, applying the exponential weight (EXP) learning algorithm to the stable matching game achieves logarithmic regret in a fully decentralized and uncoordinated fashion. Moreover, we show that EXP converges locally and exponentially fast to a stable matching in general markets. We also introduce another decentralized and uncoordinated learning algorithm that globally converges to a stable matching with arbitrarily high probability. Finally, we provide stronger feedback conditions under which it is possible to drive the market faster toward an approximate stable matching. Our proposed game-theoretic framework bridges the discrete problem of learning stable matchings with the problem of learning NE in continuous-action games.</description>

      <title>Two Completely Parameter-Free Alternating Gradient Projection Algorithms for Nonconvex-(strongly) Concave Minimax Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to their importance in various emerging applications, efficient algorithms for solving minimax problems have recently received increasing attention. However, many existing algorithms require prior knowledge of the problem parameters in order to achieve optimal iteration complexity. In this paper, we propose two completely parameter-free alternating gradient projection algorithms, i.e., the PF-AGP-NSC algorithm and the PF-AGP-NC algorithm, to solve the smooth nonconvex-strongly concave and nonconvex-concave minimax problems respectively using a backtracking strategy, which does not require prior knowledge of parameters such as the Lipschtiz constant $L$ or the strongly concave constant $\mu$. Moreover, we show that the total number of gradient calls of the PF-AGP-NSC algorithm and the PF-AGP-NC algorithm to obtain an $\varepsilon$-stationary point is upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}\left( L\kappa^3\varepsilon^{-2} \right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left( L^4\varepsilon^{-4} \right)$ respectively, where $\kappa$ is the condition number. As far as we know, the PF-AGP-NSC algorithm and the PF-AGP-NC algorithm are the first completely parameter-free algorithms for solving nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems and nonconvex-concave minimax problems respectively. Numerical results validate the efficiency of the proposed PF-AGP algorithm.</description>

      <title>Hedge Fund Portfolio Construction Using PolyModel Theory and iTransformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When constructing portfolios, a key problem is that a lot of financial time series data are sparse, making it challenging to apply machine learning methods. Polymodel theory can solve this issue and demonstrate superiority in portfolio construction from various aspects. To implement the PolyModel theory for constructing a hedge fund portfolio, we begin by identifying an asset pool, utilizing over 10,000 hedge funds for the past 29 years' data. PolyModel theory also involves choosing a wide-ranging set of risk factors, which includes various financial indices, currencies, and commodity prices. This comprehensive selection mirrors the complexities of the real-world environment. Leveraging on the PolyModel theory, we create quantitative measures such as Long-term Alpha, Long-term Ratio, and SVaR. We also use more classical measures like the Sharpe ratio or Morningstar's MRAR. To enhance the performance of the constructed portfolio, we also employ the latest deep learning techniques (iTransformer) to capture the upward trend, while efficiently controlling the downside, using all the features. The iTransformer model is specifically designed to address the challenges in high-dimensional time series forecasting and could largely improve our strategies. More precisely, our strategies achieve better Sharpe ratio and annualized return. The above process enables us to create multiple portfolio strategies aiming for high returns and low risks when compared to various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>PsyDI: Towards a Personalized and Progressively In-depth Chatbot for Psychological Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of psychology, traditional assessment methods, such as standardized scales, are frequently critiqued for their static nature, lack of personalization, and reduced participant engagement, while comprehensive counseling evaluations are often inaccessible. The complexity of quantifying psychological traits further limits these methods. Despite advances with large language models (LLMs), many still depend on single-round Question-and-Answer interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce PsyDI, a personalized and progressively in-depth chatbot designed for psychological measurements, exemplified by its application in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) framework. PsyDI leverages user-related multi-modal information and engages in customized, multi-turn interactions to provide personalized, easily accessible measurements, while ensuring precise MBTI type determination. To address the challenge of unquantifiable psychological traits, we introduce a novel training paradigm that involves learning the ranking of proxy variables associated with these traits, culminating in a robust score model for MBTI measurements. The score model enables PsyDI to conduct comprehensive and precise measurements through multi-turn interactions within a unified estimation context. Through various experiments, we validate the efficacy of both the score model and the PsyDI pipeline, demonstrating its potential to serve as a general framework for psychological measurements. Furthermore, the online deployment of PsyDI has garnered substantial user engagement, with over 3,000 visits, resulting in the collection of numerous multi-turn dialogues annotated with MBTI types, which facilitates further research. The source code for the training and web service components is publicly available as a part of OpenDILab at: https://github.com/opendilab/PsyDI</description>

      <title>The AI Scientist: Towards Fully Automated Open-Ended Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the grand challenges of artificial general intelligence is developing agents capable of conducting scientific research and discovering new knowledge. While frontier models have already been used as aides to human scientists, e.g. for brainstorming ideas, writing code, or prediction tasks, they still conduct only a small part of the scientific process. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models to perform research independently and communicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the human scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it to three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea is implemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 per paper. To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automated reviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper scores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automated reviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking us closer to a world where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed on the world's most challenging problems.

      <title>A Spitting Image: Modular Superpixel Tokenization in Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures traditionally employ a grid-based approach to tokenization independent of the semantic content of an image. We propose a modular superpixel tokenization strategy which decouples tokenization and feature extraction; a shift from contemporary approaches where these are treated as an undifferentiated whole. Using on-line content-aware tokenization and scale- and shape-invariant positional embeddings, we perform experiments and ablations that contrast our approach with patch-based tokenization and randomized partitions as baselines. We show that our method significantly improves the faithfulness of attributions, gives pixel-level granularity on zero-shot unsupervised dense prediction tasks, while maintaining predictive performance in classification tasks. Our approach provides a modular tokenization framework commensurable with standard architectures, extending the space of ViTs to a larger class of semantically-rich models.</description>
