      <title>TypeScore: A Text Fidelity Metric for Text-to-Image Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating text-to-image generative models remains a challenge, despite the remarkable progress being made in their overall performances. While existing metrics like CLIPScore work for coarse evaluations, they lack the sensitivity to distinguish finer differences as model performance rapidly improves. In this work, we focus on the text rendering aspect of these models, which provides a lens for evaluating a generative model's fine-grained instruction-following capabilities. To this end, we introduce a new evaluation framework called TypeScore to sensitively assess a model's ability to generate images with high-fidelity embedded text by following precise instructions. We argue that this text generation capability serves as a proxy for general instruction-following ability in image synthesis. TypeScore uses an additional image description model and leverages an ensemble dissimilarity measure between the original and extracted text to evaluate the fidelity of the rendered text. Our proposed metric demonstrates greater resolution than CLIPScore to differentiate popular image generation models across a range of instructions with diverse text styles. Our study also evaluates how well these vision-language models (VLMs) adhere to stylistic instructions, disentangling style evaluation from embedded-text fidelity. Through human evaluation studies, we quantitatively meta-evaluate the effectiveness of the metric. Comprehensive analysis is conducted to explore factors such as text length, captioning models, and current progress towards human parity on this task. The framework provides insights into remaining gaps in instruction-following for image generation with embedded text.</description>

      <title>Entropic Hetero-Associative Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Entropic Associative Memory holds objects in a 2D relation or ``memory plane'' using a finite table as the medium. Memory objects are stored by reinforcing simultaneously the cells used by the cue, implementing a form of Hebb's learning rule. Stored objects are ``overlapped'' on the medium, hence the memory is indeterminate and has an entropy value at each state. The retrieval operation constructs an object from the cue and such indeterminate content. In this paper we present the extension to the hetero-associative case in which these properties are preserved. Pairs of hetero-associated objects, possibly of different domain and/or modalities, are held in a 4D relation. The memory retrieval operation selects a largely indeterminate 2D memory plane that is specific to the input cue; however, there is no cue left to retrieve an object from such latter plane. We propose three incremental methods to address such missing cue problem, which we call random, sample and test, and search and test. The model is assessed with composite recollections consisting of manuscripts digits and letters selected from the MNIST and the EMNIST corpora, respectively, such that cue digits retrieve their associated letters and vice versa. We show the memory performance and illustrate the memory retrieval operation using all three methods. The system shows promise for storing, recognizing and retrieving very large sets of object with very limited computing resources.</description>

      <title>Cross-D Conv: Cross-Dimensional Transferable Knowledge Base via Fourier Shifting Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In biomedical imaging analysis, the dichotomy between 2D and 3D data presents a significant challenge. While 3D volumes offer superior real-world applicability, they are less available for each modality and not easy to train in large scale, whereas 2D samples are abundant but less comprehensive. This paper introduces the Cross-D Conv operation, a novel approach that bridges the dimensional gap by learning the phase shifting in the Fourier domain. Our method enables seamless weight transfer between 2D and 3D convolution operations, effectively facilitating cross-dimensional learning. The proposed architecture leverages the abundance of 2D training data to enhance 3D model performance, offering a practical solution to the multimodal data scarcity challenge in 3D medical model pretraining. Experimental validation on the RadImagenet (2D) and multimodal (3D) sets demonstrates that our approach achieves comparable or superior performance in feature quality assessment comparable to conventional methods. The enhanced convolution operation presents new opportunities for developing efficient classification and segmentation models in medical imaging. This work represents an advancement in cross-dimensional and multi-modal medical image analysis, offering a robust framework for utilizing 2D priors in 3D model pretraining or vice versa while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the details of Women in Computer Vision Workshop - WiCV 2024, organized alongside the CVPR 2024 in Seattle, Washington, United States. WiCV aims to amplify the voices of underrepresented women in the computer vision community, fostering increased visibility in both academia and industry. We believe that such events play a vital role in addressing gender imbalances within the field. The annual WiCV@CVPR workshop offers a)~opportunity for collaboration between researchers from minority groups, b) mentorship for female junior researchers, c) financial support to presenters to alleviate financial burdens and d)~a diverse array of role models who can inspire younger researchers at the outset of their careers. In this paper, we present a comprehensive report on the workshop program, historical trends from the past WiCV@CVPR events, and a summary of statistics related to presenters, attendees, and sponsorship for the WiCV 2024 workshop.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Semantic Communication for Wireless Visual Question Answering with Scene Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As demands for communication and computational capabilities escalate, traditional bit-oriented communication falls short of these stringent requirements, especially for mission-critical and computation-intensive applications. Visual Question Answering (VQA), a representative application, has adopted edge computing to mitigate local computational constraints and accelerate visual perception with natural language. However, it encounters significant communication challenges such as limited bandwidth, reduced transmission power, and increased noise levels, leading to considerable latency and reduced efficiency in image and question transmission. we propose a goal-oriented semantic communication (GSC) framework that focuses on effectively extracting and transmitting semantic information most relevant to the VQA goals, improving the answering accuracy and enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency. The objective is to maximize the answering accuracy, and we propose a scene graphs (SG)-based image semantic extraction and ranking approach to prioritize the semantic information based on the goal of questions. Experimental results demonstrate that our GSC framework improves answering accuracy by up to 59% under Rayleigh channels while reducing total latency by up to 65% compared to traditional bit-oriented transmission.</description>

      <title>A Study of Data Augmentation Techniques to Overcome Data Scarcity in Wound Classification using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic wounds are a significant burden on individuals and the healthcare system, affecting millions of people and incurring high costs. Wound classification using deep learning techniques is a promising approach for faster diagnosis and treatment initiation. However, lack of high quality data to train the ML models is a major challenge to realize the potential of ML in wound care. In fact, data limitations are the biggest challenge in studies using medical or forensic imaging today. We study data augmentation techniques that can be used to overcome the data scarcity limitations and unlock the potential of deep learning based solutions. In our study we explore a range of data augmentation techniques from geometric transformations of wound images to advanced GANs, to enrich and expand datasets. Using the Keras, Tensorflow, and Pandas libraries, we implemented the data augmentation techniques that can generate realistic wound images. We show that geometric data augmentation can improve classification performance, F1 scores, by up to 11% on top of state-of-the-art models, across several key classes of wounds. Our experiments with GAN based augmentation prove the viability of using DE-GANs to generate wound images with richer variations. Our study and results show that data augmentation is a valuable privacy-preserving tool with huge potential to overcome the data scarcity limitations and we believe it will be part of any real-world ML-based wound care system.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking XAI Explanations with Human-Aligned Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PASTA (Perceptual Assessment System for explanaTion of Artificial intelligence), a novel framework for a human-centric evaluation of XAI techniques in computer vision. Our first key contribution is a human evaluation of XAI explanations on four diverse datasets (COCO, Pascal Parts, Cats Dogs Cars, and MonumAI) which constitutes the first large-scale benchmark dataset for XAI, with annotations at both the image and concept levels. This dataset allows for robust evaluation and comparison across various XAI methods. Our second major contribution is a data-based metric for assessing the interpretability of explanations. It mimics human preferences, based on a database of human evaluations of explanations in the PASTA-dataset. With its dataset and metric, the PASTA framework provides consistent and reliable comparisons between XAI techniques, in a way that is scalable but still aligned with human evaluations. Additionally, our benchmark allows for comparisons between explanations across different modalities, an aspect previously unaddressed. Our findings indicate that humans tend to prefer saliency maps over other explanation types. Moreover, we provide evidence that human assessments show a low correlation with existing XAI metrics that are numerically simulated by probing the model.</description>

      <title>Building a Synthetic Vascular Model: Evaluation in an Intracranial Aneurysms Detection Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We hereby present a full synthetic model, able to mimic the various constituents of the cerebral vascular tree, including the cerebral arteries, bifurcations and intracranial aneurysms. This model intends to provide a substantial dataset of brain arteries which could be used by a 3D convolutional neural network to efficiently detect Intra-Cranial Aneurysms. The cerebral aneurysms most often occur on a particular structure of the vascular tree named the Circle of Willis. Various studies have been conducted to detect and monitor the aneurysms and those based on Deep Learning achieve the best performance. Specifically, in this work, we propose a full synthetic 3D model able to mimic the brain vasculature as acquired by Magnetic Resonance Angiography, Time Of Flight principle. Among the various MRI modalities, this latter allows for a good rendering of the blood vessels and is non-invasive. Our model has been designed to simultaneously mimic the arteries' geometry, the aneurysm shape, and the background noise. The vascular tree geometry is modeled thanks to an interpolation with 3D Spline functions, and the statistical properties of the background noise is collected from angiography acquisitions and reproduced within the model. In this work, we thoroughly describe the synthetic vasculature model, we build up a neural network designed for aneurysm segmentation and detection, finally, we carry out an in-depth evaluation of the performance gap gained thanks to the synthetic model data augmentation.</description>

      <title>INQUIRE: A Natural World Text-to-Image Retrieval Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce INQUIRE, a text-to-image retrieval benchmark designed to challenge multimodal vision-language models on expert-level queries. INQUIRE includes iNaturalist 2024 (iNat24), a new dataset of five million natural world images, along with 250 expert-level retrieval queries. These queries are paired with all relevant images comprehensively labeled within iNat24, comprising 33,000 total matches. Queries span categories such as species identification, context, behavior, and appearance, emphasizing tasks that require nuanced image understanding and domain expertise. Our benchmark evaluates two core retrieval tasks: (1) INQUIRE-Fullrank, a full dataset ranking task, and (2) INQUIRE-Rerank, a reranking task for refining top-100 retrievals. Detailed evaluation of a range of recent multimodal models demonstrates that INQUIRE poses a significant challenge, with the best models failing to achieve an mAP@50 above 50%. In addition, we show that reranking with more powerful multimodal models can enhance retrieval performance, yet there remains a significant margin for improvement. By focusing on scientifically-motivated ecological challenges, INQUIRE aims to bridge the gap between AI capabilities and the needs of real-world scientific inquiry, encouraging the development of retrieval systems that can assist with accelerating ecological and biodiversity research.

      <title>TripletCLIP: Improving Compositional Reasoning of CLIP via Synthetic Vision-Language Negatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) models maximize the mutual information between text and visual modalities to learn representations. This makes the nature of the training data a significant factor in the efficacy of CLIP for downstream tasks. However, the lack of compositional diversity in contemporary image-text datasets limits the compositional reasoning ability of CLIP. We show that generating ``hard'' negative captions via in-context learning and synthesizing corresponding negative images with text-to-image generators offers a solution. We introduce a novel contrastive pre-training strategy that leverages these hard negative captions and images in an alternating fashion to train CLIP. We demonstrate that our method, named TripletCLIP, when applied to existing datasets such as CC3M and CC12M, enhances the compositional capabilities of CLIP, resulting in an absolute improvement of over 9% on the SugarCrepe benchmark on an equal computational budget, as well as improvements in zero-shot image classification and image retrieval.

      <title>Map++: Towards User-Participatory Visual SLAM Systems with Efficient Map Expansion and Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing precise 3D maps is crucial for the development of future map-based systems such as self-driving and navigation. However, generating these maps in complex environments, such as multi-level parking garages or shopping malls, remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we introduce a participatory sensing approach that delegates map-building tasks to map users, thereby enabling cost-effective and continuous data collection. The proposed method harnesses the collective efforts of users, facilitating the expansion and ongoing update of the maps as the environment evolves.
  We realized this approach by developing Map++, an efficient system that functions as a plug-and-play extension, supporting participatory map-building based on existing SLAM algorithms. Map++ addresses a plethora of scalability issues in this participatory map-building system by proposing a set of lightweight, application-layer protocols. We evaluated Map++ in four representative settings: an indoor garage, an outdoor plaza, a public SLAM benchmark, and a simulated environment. The results demonstrate that Map++ can reduce traffic volume by approximately 46% with negligible degradation in mapping accuracy, i.e., less than 0.03m compared to the baseline system. It can support approximately $2 \times$ as many concurrent users as the baseline under the same network bandwidth. Additionally, for users who travel on already-mapped trajectories, they can directly utilize the existing maps for localization and save 47% of the CPU usage.</description>

      <title>Segment Anything for Dendrites from Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation of cellular structures in electron microscopy (EM) images is fundamental to analyzing the morphology of neurons and glial cells in the healthy and diseased brain tissue. Current neuronal segmentation applications are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and do not effectively capture global relationships within images. Here, we present DendriteSAM, a vision foundation model based on Segment Anything, for interactive and automatic segmentation of dendrites in EM images. The model is trained on high-resolution EM data from healthy rat hippocampus and is tested on diseased rat and human data. Our evaluation results demonstrate better mask quality compared to the original and other fine-tuned models, leveraging the features learned during training. This study introduces the first implementation of vision foundation models in dendrite segmentation, paving the path for computer-assisted diagnosis of neuronal anomalies.</description>

      <title>Continual LLaVA: Continual Instruction Tuning in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction tuning constitutes a prevalent technique for tailoring Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) to meet individual task requirements. To date, most of the existing approaches are confined to single-task adaptation, whereas the requirements in real-world scenarios are inherently varied and continually evolving. Thus an ideal LVLM should sustain continual instruction tuning in the face of stream-task distributions (i.e., different domains, emerging capabilities, and new datasets) while minimizing the forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. To achieve this, we propose a new benchmark for COntinuAl inStruction Tuning on LVLMs (COAST), which encompasses the aforementioned domain-incremental, capability-incremental, and dataset-incremental configurations. In terms of methodology, we propose Continual LLaVA, a rehearsal-free method tailored for continual instruction tuning in LVLMs. To circumvent the additional overhead associated with experience replay, we freeze LVLMs and construct the dual increment embeddings for each input instruction to facilitate parameter-efficient tuning. Specifically, the increment embeddings can be decomposed into two principal components: 1) intrinsic increment embeddings to encode task-specific characteristics. To achieve this, we set up a low-rank pool containing candidate embeddings, from which we select the relevant ones based on their similarity with the user instructions; 2) contextual increment embeddings to investigate the inter-dependencies across tasks. In this regard, the low-rank embeddings chosen in the previous tasks are aggregated via learnable weighted sum to provide complementary hints. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed Continual LLaVA outperforms previous methods by significantly reducing the forgetting during the continual instruction tuning process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying procedural errors online from egocentric videos is a critical yet challenging task across various domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, and skill-based training. The nature of such mistakes is inherently open-set, as unforeseen or novel errors may occur, necessitating robust detection systems that do not rely on prior examples of failure. Currently, however, no technique effectively detects open-set procedural mistakes online.
  We propose a dual branch architecture to address this problem in an online fashion: one branch continuously performs step recognition from the input egocentric video, while the other anticipates future steps based on the recognition module's output. Mistakes are detected as mismatches between the currently recognized action and the action predicted by the anticipation module. The recognition branch takes input frames, predicts the current action, and aggregates frame-level results into action tokens. The anticipation branch, specifically, leverages the solid pattern-matching capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict action tokens based on previously predicted ones.
  Given the online nature of the task, we also thoroughly benchmark the difficulties associated with per-frame evaluations, particularly the need for accurate and timely predictions in dynamic online scenarios.
  Extensive experiments on two procedural datasets demonstrate the challenges and opportunities of leveraging a dual-branch architecture for mistake detection, showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed approach. In a thorough evaluation including recognition and anticipation variants and state-of-the-art models, our method reveals its robustness and effectiveness in online applications.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Detection for Small UAVs: Combining YOLO and Multi-frame Motion Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) detection technology plays a critical role in mitigating security risks and safeguarding privacy in both military and civilian applications. However, traditional detection methods face significant challenges in identifying UAV targets with extremely small pixels at long distances. To address this issue, we propose the Global-Local YOLO-Motion (GL-YOMO) detection algorithm, which combines You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection with multi-frame motion detection techniques, markedly enhancing the accuracy and stability of small UAV target detection. The YOLO detection algorithm is optimized through multi-scale feature fusion and attention mechanisms, while the integration of the Ghost module further improves efficiency. Additionally, a motion detection approach based on template matching is being developed to augment detection capabilities for minute UAV targets. The system utilizes a global-local collaborative detection strategy to achieve high precision and efficiency. Experimental results on a self-constructed fixed-wing UAV dataset demonstrate that the GL-YOMO algorithm significantly enhances detection accuracy and stability, underscoring its potential in UAV detection applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a tracking-based HD mapping algorithm for top-down road images, referred to as tile images. While HD maps traditionally rely on perspective camera images, our approach shows that tile images can also be effectively utilized, offering valuable contributions to this research area as it can be start of a new path in HD mapping algorithms. We modified the BEVFormer layers to generate BEV masks from tile images, which are then used by the model to generate divider and boundary lines. Our model was tested with both color and intensity images, and we present quantitative and qualitative results to demonstrate its performance.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Data Augmentation for Improving Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image mixing and generative data augmentation have shown promise in enhancing image classification. However, these techniques face the challenge of balancing semantic fidelity with diversity. Specifically, image mixing involves interpolating two images to create a new one, but this pixel-level interpolation can compromise fidelity. Generative augmentation uses text-to-image generative models to synthesize or modify images, often limiting diversity to avoid generating out-of-distribution data that potentially affects accuracy. We propose that this fidelity-diversity dilemma partially stems from the whole-image paradigm of existing methods. Since an image comprises the class-dependent part (CDP) and the class-independent part (CIP), where each part has fundamentally different impacts on the image's fidelity, treating different parts uniformly can therefore be misleading. To address this fidelity-diversity dilemma, we introduce Decoupled Data Augmentation (De-DA), which resolves the dilemma by separating images into CDPs and CIPs and handling them adaptively. To maintain fidelity, we use generative models to modify real CDPs under controlled conditions, preserving semantic consistency. To enhance diversity, we replace the image's CIP with inter-class variants, creating diverse CDP-CIP combinations. Additionally, we implement an online randomized combination strategy during training to generate numerous distinct CDP-CIP combinations cost-effectively. Comprehensive empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel real-time, delay-aware cooperative perception system designed for intelligent mobility platforms operating in dynamic indoor environments. The system contains a network of multi-modal sensor nodes and a central node that collectively provide perception services to mobility platforms. The proposed Hierarchical Clustering Considering the Scanning Pattern and Ground Contacting Feature based Lidar Camera Fusion improve intra-node perception for crowded environment. The system also features delay-aware global perception to synchronize and aggregate data across nodes. To validate our approach, we introduced the Indoor Pedestrian Tracking dataset, compiled from data captured by two indoor sensor nodes. Our experiments, compared to baselines, demonstrate significant improvements in detection accuracy and robustness against delays.

      <title>Intelligent Video Recording Optimization using Activity Detection for Surveillance Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surveillance systems often struggle with managing vast amounts of footage, much of which is irrelevant, leading to inefficient storage and challenges in event retrieval. This paper addresses these issues by proposing an optimized video recording solution focused on activity detection. The proposed approach utilizes a hybrid method that combines motion detection via frame subtraction with object detection using YOLOv9. This strategy specifically targets the recording of scenes involving human or car activity, thereby reducing unnecessary footage and optimizing storage usage. The developed model demonstrates superior performance, achieving precision metrics of 0.855 for car detection and 0.884 for person detection, and reducing the storage requirements by two-thirds compared to traditional surveillance systems that rely solely on motion detection. This significant reduction in storage highlights the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing surveillance system efficiency. Nonetheless, some limitations persist, particularly the occurrence of false positives and false negatives in adverse weather conditions, such as strong winds.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Hierarchical Open Set Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel data-driven hierarchical approach to open set recognition (OSR) for robust perception in robotics and computer vision, utilizing constrained agglomerative clustering to automatically build a hierarchy of known classes in embedding space without requiring manual relational information. The method, demonstrated on the Animals with Attributes 2 (AwA2) dataset, achieves competitive results with an AUC ROC score of 0.82 and utility score of 0.85, while introducing two classification approaches (score-based and traversal-based) and a new Concentration Centrality (CC) metric for measuring hierarchical classification consistency. Although not surpassing existing models in accuracy, the approach provides valuable additional information about unknown classes through automatically generated hierarchies, requires no supplementary information beyond typical supervised model requirements, and introduces the Class Concentration Centrality (CCC) metric for evaluating unknown class placement consistency, with future work aimed at improving accuracy, validating the CC metric, and expanding to Large-Scale Open-Set Classification Protocols for ImageNet.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aligned Adversarial Evolution Triangle for High-Transferability Vision-Language Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models excel at interpreting both images and text but remain vulnerable to multimodal adversarial examples (AEs). Advancing the generation of transferable AEs, which succeed across unseen models, is key to developing more robust and practical VLP models. Previous approaches augment image-text pairs to enhance diversity within the adversarial example generation process, aiming to improve transferability by expanding the contrast space of image-text features. However, these methods focus solely on diversity around the current AEs, yielding limited gains in transferability. To address this issue, we propose to increase the diversity of AEs by leveraging the intersection regions along the adversarial trajectory during optimization. Specifically, we propose sampling from adversarial evolution triangles composed of clean, historical, and current adversarial examples to enhance adversarial diversity. We provide a theoretical analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adversarial evolution triangle. Moreover, we find that redundant inactive dimensions can dominate similarity calculations, distorting feature matching and making AEs model-dependent with reduced transferability. Hence, we propose to generate AEs in the semantic image-text feature contrast space, which can project the original feature space into a semantic corpus subspace. The proposed semantic-aligned subspace can reduce the image feature redundancy, thereby improving adversarial transferability. Extensive experiments across different datasets and models demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve adversarial transferability and outperform state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods.

      <title>Multi-Transmotion: Pre-trained Model for Human Motion Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of intelligent systems to predict human behaviors is crucial, particularly in fields such as autonomous vehicle navigation and social robotics. However, the complexity of human motion have prevented the development of a standardized dataset for human motion prediction, thereby hindering the establishment of pre-trained models. In this paper, we address these limitations by integrating multiple datasets, encompassing both trajectory and 3D pose keypoints, to propose a pre-trained model for human motion prediction. We merge seven distinct datasets across varying modalities and standardize their formats. To facilitate multimodal pre-training, we introduce Multi-Transmotion, an innovative transformer-based model designed for cross-modality pre-training. Additionally, we present a novel masking strategy to capture rich representations. Our methodology demonstrates competitive performance across various datasets on several downstream tasks, including trajectory prediction in the NBA and JTA datasets, as well as pose prediction in the AMASS and 3DPW datasets.

      <title>Transferable polychromatic optical encoder for neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have fundamentally transformed the field of computer vision, providing unprecedented performance. However, these ANNs for image processing demand substantial computational resources, often hindering real-time operation. In this paper, we demonstrate an optical encoder that can perform convolution simultaneously in three color channels during the image capture, effectively implementing several initial convolutional layers of a ANN. Such an optical encoding results in ~24,000 times reduction in computational operations, with a state-of-the art classification accuracy (~73.2%) in free-space optical system. In addition, our analog optical encoder, trained for CIFAR-10 data, can be transferred to the ImageNet subset, High-10, without any modifications, and still exhibits moderate accuracy. Our results evidence the potential of hybrid optical/digital computer vision system in which the optical frontend can pre-process an ambient scene to reduce the energy and latency of the whole computer vision system.</description>

      <title>Full Field Digital Mammography Dataset from a Population Screening Program</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer presents the second largest cancer risk in the world to women. Early detection of cancer has been shown to be effective in reducing mortality. Population screening programs schedule regular mammography imaging for participants, promoting early detection. Currently, such screening programs require manual reading. False-positive errors in the reading process unnecessarily leads to costly follow-up and patient anxiety. Automated methods promise to provide more efficient, consistent and effective reading. To facilitate their development, a number of datasets have been created. With the aim of specifically targeting population screening programs, we introduce NL-Breast-Screening, a dataset from a Canadian provincial screening program. The dataset consists of 5997 mammography exams, each of which has four standard views and is biopsy-confirmed. Cases where radiologist reading was a false-positive are identified. NL-Breast is made publicly available as a new resource to promote advances in automation for population screening programs.</description>

      <title>V-DPO: Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision Language Models via Vision-Guided Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) suffer from hallucination, resulting in misalignment between the output textual response and the input visual content. Recent research indicates that the over-reliance on the Large Language Model (LLM) backbone, as one cause of the LVLM hallucination, inherently introduces bias from language priors, leading to insufficient context attention to the visual inputs.
  We tackle this issue of hallucination by mitigating such over-reliance through preference learning. We propose Vision-guided Direct Preference Optimization (V-DPO) to enhance visual context learning at training time. To interpret the effectiveness and generalizability of V-DPO on different types of training data, we construct a synthetic dataset containing both response- and image-contrast preference pairs, compared against existing human-annotated hallucination samples. Our approach achieves significant improvements compared with baseline methods across various hallucination benchmarks. Our analysis indicates that V-DPO excels in learning from image-contrast preference data, demonstrating its superior ability to elicit and understand nuances of visual context. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/YuxiXie/V-DPO.</description>

      <title>CIT: Rethinking Class-incremental Semantic Segmentation with a Class Independent Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CSS) requires that a model learn to segment new classes without forgetting how to segment previous ones: this is typically achieved by distilling the current knowledge and incorporating the latest data. However, bypassing iterative distillation by directly transferring outputs of initial classes to the current learning task is not supported in existing class-specific CSS methods. Via Softmax, they enforce dependency between classes and adjust the output distribution at each learning step, resulting in a large probability distribution gap between initial and current tasks. We introduce a simple, yet effective Class Independent Transformation (CIT) that converts the outputs of existing semantic segmentation models into class-independent forms with negligible cost or performance loss. By utilizing class-independent predictions facilitated by CIT, we establish an accumulative distillation framework, ensuring equitable incorporation of all class information. We conduct extensive experiments on various segmentation architectures, including DeepLabV3, Mask2Former, and SegViTv2. Results from these experiments show minimal task forgetting across different datasets, with less than 5% for ADE20K in the most challenging 11 task configurations and less than 1% across all configurations for the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of large vision language models (LVLMs), these models have shown excellent results in various multimodal tasks. Since LVLMs are prone to hallucinations and there are currently few datasets and evaluation methods specifically designed for remote sensing, their performance is typically poor when applied to remote sensing tasks. To address these issues, this paper introduces a high quality remote sensing LVLMs dataset, DDFAV, created using data augmentation and data mixing strategies. Next, a training instruction set is produced based on some high-quality remote sensing images selected from the proposed dataset. Finally, we develop a remote sensing LVLMs hallucination evaluation method RSPOPE based on the proposed dataset and evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of different LVLMs. Our proposed dataset, instruction set, and evaluation method files are available at https://github.com/HaodongLi2024/rspope.</description>

      <title>Efficient Feature Aggregation and Scale-Aware Regression for Monocular 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection has attracted great attention due to simplicity and low cost. Existing methods typically follow conventional 2D detection paradigms, first locating object centers and then predicting 3D attributes via neighboring features. However, these methods predominantly rely on progressive cross-scale feature aggregation and focus solely on local information, which may result in a lack of global awareness and the omission of small-scale objects. In addition, due to large variation in object scales across different scenes and depths, inaccurate receptive fields often lead to background noise and degraded feature representation. To address these issues, we introduces MonoASRH, a novel monocular 3D detection framework composed of Efficient Hybrid Feature Aggregation Module (EH-FAM) and Adaptive Scale-Aware 3D Regression Head (ASRH). Specifically, EH-FAM employs multi-head attention with a global receptive field to extract semantic features for small-scale objects and leverages lightweight convolutional modules to efficiently aggregate visual features across different scales. The ASRH encodes 2D bounding box dimensions and then fuses scale features with the semantic features aggregated by EH-FAM through a scale-semantic feature fusion module. The scale-semantic feature fusion module guides ASRH in learning dynamic receptive field offsets, incorporating scale priors into 3D position prediction for better scale-awareness. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate that MonoASRH achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

Abstract: As medical datasets rapidly expand, creating detailed annotations of different body structures becomes increasingly expensive and time-consuming. We consider that requesting radiologists to create detailed annotations is unnecessarily burdensome and that pre-existing AI models can largely automate this process. Following the spirit don't use a sledgehammer on a nut, we find that, rather than creating annotations from scratch, radiologists only have to review and edit errors if the Best-AI Labels have mistakes. To obtain the Best-AI Labels among multiple AI Labels, we developed an automatic tool, called Label Critic, that can assess label quality through tireless pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when incorporated with our developed Image-Prompt pairs, pre-existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM), trained on natural images and texts, achieve 96.5% accuracy when choosing the best label in a pair-wise comparison, without extra fine-tuning. By transforming the manual annotation task (30-60 min/scan) into an automatic comparison task (15 sec/scan), we effectively reduce the manual efforts required from radiologists by an order of magnitude. When the Best-AI Labels are sufficiently accurate (81% depending on body structures), they will be directly adopted as the gold-standard annotations for the dataset, with lower-quality AI Labels automatically discarded. Label Critic can also check the label quality of a single AI Label with 71.8% accuracy when no alternatives are available for comparison, prompting radiologists to review and edit if the estimated quality is low (19% depending on body structures).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The EcoCropsAID dataset is a comprehensive collection of 5,400 aerial images captured between 2014 and 2018 using the Google Earth application. This dataset focuses on five key economic crops in Thailand: rice, sugarcane, cassava, rubber, and longan. The images were collected at various crop growth stages: early cultivation, growth, and harvest, resulting in significant variability within each category and similarities across different categories. These variations, coupled with differences in resolution, color, and contrast introduced by multiple remote imaging sensors, present substantial challenges for land use classification. The dataset is an interdisciplinary resource that spans multiple research domains, including remote sensing, geoinformatics, artificial intelligence, and computer vision. The unique features of the EcoCropsAID dataset offer opportunities for researchers to explore novel approaches, such as extracting spatial and temporal features, developing deep learning architectures, and implementing transformer-based models. The EcoCropsAID dataset provides a valuable platform for advancing research in land use classification, with implications for optimizing agricultural practices and enhancing sustainable development. This study explicitly investigates the use of deep learning algorithms to classify economic crop areas in northeastern Thailand, utilizing satellite imagery to address the challenges posed by diverse patterns and similarities across categories.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Thai One-Stage Fingerspelling (One-Stage-TFS) dataset is a comprehensive resource designed to advance research in hand gesture recognition, explicitly focusing on the recognition of Thai sign language. This dataset comprises 7,200 images capturing 15 one-stage consonant gestures performed by undergraduate students from Rajabhat Maha Sarakham University, Thailand. The contributors include both expert students from the Special Education Department with proficiency in Thai sign language and students from other departments without prior sign language experience. Images were collected between July and December 2021 using a DSLR camera, with contributors demonstrating hand gestures against both simple and complex backgrounds. The One-Stage-TFS dataset presents challenges in detecting and recognizing hand gestures, offering opportunities to develop novel end-to-end recognition frameworks. Researchers can utilize this dataset to explore deep learning methods, such as YOLO, EfficientDet, RetinaNet, and Detectron, for hand detection, followed by feature extraction and recognition using techniques like convolutional neural networks, transformers, and adaptive feature fusion networks. The dataset is accessible via the Mendeley Data repository and supports a wide range of applications in computer science, including deep learning, computer vision, and pattern recognition, thereby encouraging further innovation and exploration in these fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the ongoing increase in the worldwide population and escalating consumption habits,there's a surge in the amount of waste produced.The situation poses considerable challenges for waste management and the optimization of recycling operations.The research tackles the pressing issue of waste classification for recycling by analyzing various deep learning models,including Convolutional Neural Network(CNN),AlexNet,ResNet,ResNet50 plus Support Vector Machine(SVM),and transformers,across a wide array of waste categories.The research meticulously compares these models on several targets like parameters settings,category accuracy,total accuracy and model parameters to establish a uniform evaluation criterion.This research presents a novel method that incorporates SVM with deep learning frameworks,particularly ResNet50.The results indicate the method significantly boosts accuracy in complex waste categories.Moreover,the transformer model outshines others in average accuracy,showcasing its aptitude for intricate classification tasks.To improve performance in poorly performing categories,the research advocates for enlarging the dataset,employing data augmentation,and leveraging sophisticated models such as transformers,along with refining training methodologies.The research paves the way for future advancements in multi-category waste recycling and underscores the pivotal role of deep learning in promoting environmental sustainability.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Text Detection with Similar Mask in Traffic, Industrial, and Natural Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Texts on the intelligent transportation scene include mass information. Fully harnessing this information is one of the critical drivers for advancing intelligent transportation. Unlike the general scene, detecting text in transportation has extra demand, such as a fast inference speed, except for high accuracy. Most existing real-time text detection methods are based on the shrink mask, which loses some geometry semantic information and needs complex post-processing. In addition, the previous method usually focuses on correct output, which ignores feature correction and lacks guidance during the intermediate process. To this end, we propose an efficient multi-scene text detector that contains an effective text representation similar mask (SM) and a feature correction module (FCM). Unlike previous methods, the former aims to preserve the geometric information of the instances as much as possible. Its post-progressing saves 50$\%$ of the time, accurately and efficiently reconstructing text contours. The latter encourages false positive features to move away from the positive feature center, optimizing the predictions from the feature level. Some ablation studies demonstrate the efficiency of the SM and the effectiveness of the FCM. Moreover, the deficiency of existing traffic datasets (such as the low-quality annotation or closed source data unavailability) motivated us to collect and annotate a traffic text dataset, which introduces motion blur. In addition, to validate the scene robustness of the SM-Net, we conduct experiments on traffic, industrial, and natural scene datasets. Extensive experiments verify it achieves (SOTA) performance on several benchmarks. The code and dataset are available at: \url{https://github.com/fengmulin/SMNet}.</description>

      <title>ERUP-YOLO: Enhancing Object Detection Robustness for Adverse Weather Condition by Unified Image-Adaptive Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an image-adaptive object detection method for adverse weather conditions such as fog and low-light. Our framework employs differentiable preprocessing filters to perform image enhancement suitable for later-stage object detections. Our framework introduces two differentiable filters: a B\'ezier curve-based pixel-wise (BPW) filter and a kernel-based local (KBL) filter. These filters unify the functions of classical image processing filters and improve performance of object detection. We also propose a domain-agnostic data augmentation strategy using the BPW filter. Our method does not require data-specific customization of the filter combinations, parameter ranges, and data augmentation. We evaluate our proposed approach, called Enhanced Robustness by Unified Image Processing (ERUP)-YOLO, by applying it to the YOLOv3 detector. Experiments on adverse weather datasets demonstrate that our proposed filters match or exceed the expressiveness of conventional methods and our ERUP-YOLO achieved superior performance in a wide range of adverse weather conditions, including fog and low-light conditions.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT in Research and Education: Exploring Benefits and Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, advanced artificial intelligence technologies, such as ChatGPT, have significantly impacted various fields, including education and research. Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT is a powerful language model that presents numerous opportunities for students and educators. It offers personalized feedback, enhances accessibility, enables interactive conversations, assists with lesson preparation and evaluation, and introduces new methods for teaching complex subjects. However, ChatGPT also poses challenges to traditional education and research systems. These challenges include the risk of cheating on online exams, the generation of human-like text that may compromise academic integrity, a potential decline in critical thinking skills, and difficulties in assessing the reliability of information generated by AI. This study examines both the opportunities and challenges ChatGPT brings to education from the perspectives of students and educators. Specifically, it explores the role of ChatGPT in helping students develop their subjective skills. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conducted several subjective experiments using ChatGPT, such as generating solutions from subjective problem descriptions. Additionally, surveys were conducted with students and teachers to gather insights into how ChatGPT supports subjective learning and teaching. The results and analysis of these surveys are presented to highlight the impact of ChatGPT in this context.</description>

      <title>LiVOS: Light Video Object Segmentation with Gated Linear Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS) has been largely driven by space-time memory (STM) networks, which store past frame features in a spatiotemporal memory to segment the current frame via softmax attention. However, STM networks face memory limitations due to the quadratic complexity of softmax matching, restricting their applicability as video length and resolution increase. To address this, we propose LiVOS, a lightweight memory network that employs linear matching via linear attention, reformulating memory matching into a recurrent process that reduces the quadratic attention matrix to a constant-size, spatiotemporal-agnostic 2D state. To enhance selectivity, we introduce gated linear matching, where a data-dependent gate matrix is multiplied with the state matrix to control what information to retain or discard. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. It achieved 64.8 J&amp;F on MOSE and 85.1 J&amp;F on DAVIS, surpassing all non-STM methods and narrowing the gap with STM-based approaches. For longer and higher-resolution videos, it matched STM-based methods with 53% less GPU memory and supports 4096p inference on a 32G consumer-grade GPU--a previously cost-prohibitive capability--opening the door for long and high-resolution video foundation models.</description>

      <title>Lost in Context: The Influence of Context on Feature Attribution Methods for Object Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextual information plays a critical role in object recognition models within computer vision, where changes in context can significantly affect accuracy, underscoring models' dependence on contextual cues. This study investigates how context manipulation influences both model accuracy and feature attribution, providing insights into the reliance of object recognition models on contextual information as understood through the lens of feature attribution methods.
  We employ a range of feature attribution techniques to decipher the reliance of deep neural networks on context in object recognition tasks. Using the ImageNet-9 and our curated ImageNet-CS datasets, we conduct experiments to evaluate the impact of contextual variations, analyzed through feature attribution methods. Our findings reveal several key insights: (a) Correctly classified images predominantly emphasize object volume attribution over context volume attribution. (b) The dependence on context remains relatively stable across different context modifications, irrespective of classification accuracy. (c) Context change exerts a more pronounced effect on model performance than Context perturbations. (d) Surprisingly, context attribution in `no-information' scenarios is non-trivial. Our research moves beyond traditional methods by assessing the implications of broad-level modifications on object recognition, either in the object or its context.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Dynamic Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent challenge of image fusion lies in capturing the correlation of multi-source images and comprehensively integrating effective information from different sources. Most existing techniques fail to perform dynamic image fusion while notably lacking theoretical guarantees, leading to potential deployment risks in this field. Is it possible to conduct dynamic image fusion with a clear theoretical justification? In this paper, we give our solution from a generalization perspective. We proceed to reveal the generalized form of image fusion and derive a new test-time dynamic image fusion paradigm. It provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error. Specifically, we decompose the fused image into multiple components corresponding to its source data. The decomposed components represent the effective information from the source data, thus the gap between them reflects the Relative Dominability (RD) of the uni-source data in constructing the fusion image. Theoretically, we prove that the key to reducing generalization error hinges on the negative correlation between the RD-based fusion weight and the uni-source reconstruction loss. Intuitively, RD dynamically highlights the dominant regions of each source and can be naturally converted to the corresponding fusion weight, achieving robust results. Extensive experiments and discussions with in-depth analysis on multiple benchmarks confirm our findings and superiority. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yinan-Xia/TTD.</description>

      <title>Advances in Photoacoustic Imaging Reconstruction and Quantitative Analysis for Biomedical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) represents an innovative biomedical imaging modality that harnesses the advantages of optical resolution and acoustic penetration depth while ensuring enhanced safety. Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</description>

      <title>Correlation of Object Detection Performance with Visual Saliency and Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As object detection techniques continue to evolve, understanding their relationships with complementary visual tasks becomes crucial for optimising model architectures and computational resources. This paper investigates the correlations between object detection accuracy and two fundamental visual tasks: depth prediction and visual saliency prediction. Through comprehensive experiments using state-of-the-art models (DeepGaze IIE, Depth Anything, DPT-Large, and Itti's model) on COCO and Pascal VOC datasets, we find that visual saliency shows consistently stronger correlations with object detection accuracy (mA$\rho$ up to 0.459 on Pascal VOC) compared to depth prediction (mA$\rho$ up to 0.283). Our analysis reveals significant variations in these correlations across object categories, with larger objects showing correlation values up to three times higher than smaller objects. These findings suggest incorporating visual saliency features into object detection architectures could be more beneficial than depth information, particularly for specific object categories. The observed category-specific variations also provide insights for targeted feature engineering and dataset design improvements, potentially leading to more efficient and accurate object detection systems.</description>

      <title>OLAF: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Enhanced Multi-object Multi-part Scene Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-object multi-part scene segmentation is a challenging task whose complexity scales exponentially with part granularity and number of scene objects. To address the task, we propose a plug-and-play approach termed OLAF. First, we augment the input (RGB) with channels containing object-based structural cues (fg/bg mask, boundary edge mask). We propose a weight adaptation technique which enables regular (RGB) pre-trained models to process the augmented (5-channel) input in a stable manner during optimization. In addition, we introduce an encoder module termed LDF to provide low-level dense feature guidance. This assists segmentation, particularly for smaller parts. OLAF enables significant mIoU gains of $\mathbf{3.3}$ (Pascal-Parts-58), $\mathbf{3.5}$ (Pascal-Parts-108) over the SOTA model. On the most challenging variant (Pascal-Parts-201), the gain is $\mathbf{4.0}$. Experimentally, we show that OLAF's broad applicability enables gains across multiple architectures (CNN, U-Net, Transformer) and datasets. The code is available at olafseg.github.io</description>

      <title>Continual Audio-Visual Sound Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel continual audio-visual sound separation task, aiming to continuously separate sound sources for new classes while preserving performance on previously learned classes, with the aid of visual guidance. This problem is crucial for practical visually guided auditory perception as it can significantly enhance the adaptability and robustness of audio-visual sound separation models, making them more applicable for real-world scenarios where encountering new sound sources is commonplace. The task is inherently challenging as our models must not only effectively utilize information from both modalities in current tasks but also preserve their cross-modal association in old tasks to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during audio-visual continual learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach named ContAV-Sep (\textbf{Cont}inual \textbf{A}udio-\textbf{V}isual Sound \textbf{Sep}aration). ContAV-Sep presents a novel Cross-modal Similarity Distillation Constraint (CrossSDC) to uphold the cross-modal semantic similarity through incremental tasks and retain previously acquired knowledge of semantic similarity in old models, mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting. The CrossSDC can seamlessly integrate into the training process of different audio-visual sound separation frameworks. Experiments demonstrate that ContAV-Sep can effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and achieve significantly better performance compared to other continual learning baselines for audio-visual sound separation. Code is available at: \url{https://github.com/weiguoPian/ContAV-Sep_NeurIPS2024}.</description>

Abstract: Developing accurate and efficient detectors for drone imagery is challenging due to the inherent complexity of aerial scenes. While some existing methods aim to achieve high accuracy by utilizing larger models, their computational cost is prohibitive for drones. Recently, Knowledge Distillation (KD) has shown promising potential for maintaining satisfactory accuracy while significantly compressing models in general object detection. Considering the advantages of KD, this paper presents the first attempt to adapt it to object detection on drone imagery and addresses two intrinsic issues: (1) low foreground-background ratio and (2) small instances and complex backgrounds, which lead to inadequate training, resulting insufficient distillation. Therefore, we propose a task-wise Lightweight Mutual Lifting (Light-ML) module with a Centerness-based Instance-aware Distillation (CID) strategy. The Light-ML module mutually harmonizes the classification and localization branches by channel shuffling and convolution, integrating teacher supervision across different tasks during back-propagation, thus facilitating training the student model. The CID strategy extracts valuable regions surrounding instances through the centerness of proposals, enhancing distillation efficacy. Experiments on the VisDrone, UAVDT, and COCO benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach promotes the accuracies of existing state-of-the-art KD methods with comparable computational requirements. Codes will be available upon acceptance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently developed a new approach to get a stabilized image from a sequence of frames acquired through atmospheric turbulence. The goal of this algorihtm is to remove the geometric distortions due by the atmosphere movements. This method is based on a variational formulation and is efficiently solved by the use of Bregman iterations and the operator splitting method. In this paper we propose to study the influence of the choice of the regularizing term in the model. Then we proposed to experiment some of the most used regularization constraints available in the litterature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new approach to deblur the effect of atmospheric turbulence in the case of long range imaging. Our method is based on an analytical formulation, the Fried kernel, of the atmosphere modulation transfer function (MTF) and a framelet based deconvolution algorithm. An important parameter is the refractive index structure which requires specific measurements to be known. Then we propose a method which provides a good estimation of this parameter from the input blurred image. The final algorithms are very easy to implement and show very good results on both simulated blur and real images.</description>

      <title>Membership Inference Attacks against Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLLMs) exhibit promising capabilities for processing multi-modal tasks across various application scenarios. However, their emergence also raises significant data security concerns, given the potential inclusion of sensitive information, such as private photos and medical records, in their training datasets. Detecting inappropriately used data in VLLMs remains a critical and unresolved issue, mainly due to the lack of standardized datasets and suitable methodologies. In this study, we introduce the first membership inference attack (MIA) benchmark tailored for various VLLMs to facilitate training data detection. Then, we propose a novel MIA pipeline specifically designed for token-level image detection. Lastly, we present a new metric called MaxR\'enyi-K%, which is based on the confidence of the model output and applies to both text and image data. We believe that our work can deepen the understanding and methodology of MIAs in the context of VLLMs. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/VL-MIA.</description>

      <title>Domain Expansion and Boundary Growth for Open-Set Single-Source Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-set single-source domain generalization aims to use a single-source domain to learn a robust model that can be generalized to unknown target domains with both domain shifts and label shifts. The scarcity of the source domain and the unknown data distribution of the target domain pose a great challenge for domain-invariant feature learning and unknown class recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel learning approach based on domain expansion and boundary growth to expand the scarce source samples and enlarge the boundaries across the known classes that indirectly broaden the boundary between the known and unknown classes. Specifically, we achieve domain expansion by employing both background suppression and style augmentation on the source data to synthesize new samples. Then we force the model to distill consistent knowledge from the synthesized samples so that the model can learn domain-invariant information. Furthermore, we realize boundary growth across classes by using edge maps as an additional modality of samples when training multi-binary classifiers. In this way, it enlarges the boundary between the inliers and outliers, and consequently improves the unknown class recognition during open-set generalization. Extensive experiments show that our approach can achieve significant improvements and reach state-of-the-art performance on several cross-domain image classification datasets.</description>

      <title>Mapping Africa Settlements: High Resolution Urban and Rural Map by Deep Learning and Satellite Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps are essential for understanding the drivers of sustainable development, in terms of its complex interrelationships between human activities and natural resources. However, existing LULC maps often lack precise urban and rural classifications, particularly in diverse regions like Africa. This study presents a novel construction of a high-resolution rural-urban map using deep learning techniques and satellite imagery. We developed a deep learning model based on the DeepLabV3 architecture, which was trained on satellite imagery from Landsat-8 and the ESRI LULC dataset, augmented with human settlement data from the GHS-SMOD. The model utilizes semantic segmentation to classify land into detailed categories, including urban and rural areas, at a 10-meter resolution. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating LULC along with urban and rural classifications significantly enhances the model's ability to accurately distinguish between urban, rural, and non-human settlement areas. Therefore, our maps can support more informed decision-making for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders. We release a continent wide urban-rural map, covering the period 2016 and 2022.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal NeRF Self-Supervision for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR Semantic Segmentation is a fundamental task in autonomous driving perception consisting of associating each LiDAR point to a semantic label. Fully-supervised models have widely tackled this task, but they require labels for each scan, which either limits their domain or requires impractical amounts of expensive annotations. Camera images, which are generally recorded alongside LiDAR pointclouds, can be processed by the widely available 2D foundation models, which are generic and dataset-agnostic. However, distilling knowledge from 2D data to improve LiDAR perception raises domain adaptation challenges. For example, the classical perspective projection suffers from the parallax effect produced by the position shift between both sensors at their respective capture times. We propose a Semi-Supervised Learning setup to leverage unlabeled LiDAR pointclouds alongside distilled knowledge from the camera images. To self-supervise our model on the unlabeled scans, we add an auxiliary NeRF head and cast rays from the camera viewpoint over the unlabeled voxel features. The NeRF head predicts densities and semantic logits at each sampled ray location which are used for rendering pixel semantics. Concurrently, we query the Segment-Anything (SAM) foundation model with the camera image to generate a set of unlabeled generic masks. We fuse the masks with the rendered pixel semantics from LiDAR to produce pseudo-labels that supervise the pixel predictions. During inference, we drop the NeRF head and run our model with only LiDAR. We show the effectiveness of our approach in three public LiDAR Semantic Segmentation benchmarks: nuScenes, SemanticKITTI and ScribbleKITTI.</description>

      <title>Exploring Seasonal Variability in the Context of Neural Radiance Fields for 3D Reconstruction on Satellite Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the seasonal predictive capabilities of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) applied to satellite images are investigated. Focusing on the utilization of satellite data, the study explores how Sat-NeRF, a novel approach in computer vision, performs in predicting seasonal variations across different months. Through comprehensive analysis and visualization, the study examines the model's ability to capture and predict seasonal changes, highlighting specific challenges and strengths. Results showcase the impact of the sun direction on predictions, revealing nuanced details in seasonal transitions, such as snow cover, color accuracy, and texture representation in different landscapes. Given these results, we propose Planet-NeRF, an extension to Sat-NeRF capable of incorporating seasonal variability through a set of month embedding vectors. Comparative evaluations reveal that Planet-NeRF outperforms prior models in the case where seasonal changes are present. The extensive evaluation combined with the proposed method offers promising avenues for future research in this domain.</description>

      <title>Region-Guided Attack on the Segment Anything Model (SAM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a cornerstone of image segmentation, demonstrating exceptional performance across various applications, particularly in autonomous driving and medical imaging, where precise segmentation is crucial. However, SAM is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can significantly impair its functionality through minor input perturbations. Traditional techniques, such as FGSM and PGD, are often ineffective in segmentation tasks due to their reliance on global perturbations that overlook spatial nuances. Recent methods like Attack-SAM-K and UAD have begun to address these challenges, but they frequently depend on external cues and do not fully leverage the structural interdependencies within segmentation processes. This limitation underscores the need for a novel adversarial strategy that exploits the unique characteristics of segmentation tasks. In response, we introduce the Region-Guided Attack (RGA), designed specifically for SAM. RGA utilizes a Region-Guided Map (RGM) to manipulate segmented regions, enabling targeted perturbations that fragment large segments and expand smaller ones, resulting in erroneous outputs from SAM. Our experiments demonstrate that RGA achieves high success rates in both white-box and black-box scenarios, emphasizing the need for robust defenses against such sophisticated attacks. RGA not only reveals SAM's vulnerabilities but also lays the groundwork for developing more resilient defenses against adversarial threats in image segmentation.</description>

      <title>CAD-NeRF: Learning NeRFs from Uncalibrated Few-view Images by CAD Model Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing from multi-view images is a longstanding problem in 3D vision, where neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have shown great potential and get realistic rendered images of novel views. Currently, most NeRF methods either require accurate camera poses or a large number of input images, or even both. Reconstructing NeRF from few-view images without poses is challenging and highly ill-posed. To address this problem, we propose CAD-NeRF, a method reconstructed from less than 10 images without any known poses. Specifically, we build a mini library of several CAD models from ShapeNet and render them from many random views. Given sparse-view input images, we run a model and pose retrieval from the library, to get a model with similar shapes, serving as the density supervision and pose initializations. Here we propose a multi-view pose retrieval method to avoid pose conflicts among views, which is a new and unseen problem in uncalibrated NeRF methods. Then, the geometry of the object is trained by the CAD guidance. The deformation of the density field and camera poses are optimized jointly. Then texture and density are trained and fine-tuned as well. All training phases are in self-supervised manners. Comprehensive evaluations of synthetic and real images show that CAD-NeRF successfully learns accurate densities with a large deformation from retrieved CAD models, showing the generalization abilities.</description>

      <title>PV-faultNet: Optimized CNN Architecture to detect defects resulting efficient PV production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global shift towards renewable energy has pushed PV cell manufacturing as a pivotal point as they are the fundamental building block of green energy. However, the manufacturing process is complex enough to lose its purpose due to probable defects experienced during the time impacting the overall efficiency. However, at the moment, manual inspection is being conducted to detect the defects that can cause bias, leading to time and cost inefficiency. Even if automated solutions have also been proposed, most of them are resource-intensive, proving ineffective in production environments. In that context, this study presents PV-faultNet, a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture optimized for efficient and real-time defect detection in photovoltaic (PV) cells, designed to be deployable on resource-limited production devices. Addressing computational challenges in industrial PV manufacturing environments, the model includes only 2.92 million parameters, significantly reducing processing demands without sacrificing accuracy. Comprehensive data augmentation techniques were implemented to tackle data scarcity, thus enhancing model generalization and maintaining a balance between precision and recall. The proposed model achieved high performance with 91\% precision, 89\% recall, and a 90\% F1 score, demonstrating its effectiveness for scalable quality control in PV production.</description>

      <title>Precise Drive with VLM: First Prize Solution for PRCV 2024 Drive LM challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This technical report outlines the methodologies we applied for the PRCV Challenge, focusing on cognition and decision-making in driving scenarios. We employed InternVL-2.0, a pioneering open-source multi-modal model, and enhanced it by refining both the model input and training methodologies. For the input data, we strategically concatenated and formatted the multi-view images. It is worth mentioning that we utilized the coordinates of the original images without transformation. In terms of model training, we initially pre-trained the model on publicly available autonomous driving scenario datasets to bolster its alignment capabilities of the challenge tasks, followed by fine-tuning on the DriveLM-nuscenes Dataset. During the fine-tuning phase, we innovatively modified the loss function to enhance the model's precision in predicting coordinate values. These approaches ensure that our model possesses advanced cognitive and decision-making capabilities in driving scenarios. Consequently, our model achieved a score of 0.6064, securing the first prize on the competition's final results.</description>

      <title>CRT-Fusion: Camera, Radar, Temporal Fusion Using Motion Information for 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and robust 3D object detection is a critical component in autonomous vehicles and robotics. While recent radar-camera fusion methods have made significant progress by fusing information in the bird's-eye view (BEV) representation, they often struggle to effectively capture the motion of dynamic objects, leading to limited performance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CRT-Fusion, a novel framework that integrates temporal information into radar-camera fusion to address this challenge. Our approach comprises three key modules: Multi-View Fusion (MVF), Motion Feature Estimator (MFE), and Motion Guided Temporal Fusion (MGTF). The MVF module fuses radar and image features within both the camera view and bird's-eye view, thereby generating a more precise unified BEV representation. The MFE module conducts two simultaneous tasks: estimation of pixel-wise velocity information and BEV segmentation. Based on the velocity and the occupancy score map obtained from the MFE module, the MGTF module aligns and fuses feature maps across multiple timestamps in a recurrent manner. By considering the motion of dynamic objects, CRT-Fusion can produce robust BEV feature maps, thereby improving detection accuracy and robustness. Extensive evaluations on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that CRT-Fusion achieves state-of-the-art performance for radar-camera-based 3D object detection. Our approach outperforms the previous best method in terms of NDS by +1.7%, while also surpassing the leading approach in mAP by +1.4%. These significant improvements in both metrics showcase the effectiveness of our proposed fusion strategy in enhancing the reliability and accuracy of 3D object detection.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Decoders for Transformer-based Semantic Segmentation: Compression is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art methods for Transformer-based semantic segmentation typically adopt Transformer decoders that are used to extract additional embeddings from image embeddings via cross-attention, refine either or both types of embeddings via self-attention, and project image embeddings onto the additional embeddings via dot-product. Despite their remarkable success, these empirical designs still lack theoretical justifications or interpretations, thus hindering potentially principled improvements. In this paper, we argue that there are fundamental connections between semantic segmentation and compression, especially between the Transformer decoders and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). From such a perspective, we derive a white-box, fully attentional DEcoder for PrIncipled semantiC segemenTation (DEPICT), with the interpretations as follows: 1) the self-attention operator refines image embeddings to construct an ideal principal subspace that aligns with the supervision and retains most information; 2) the cross-attention operator seeks to find a low-rank approximation of the refined image embeddings, which is expected to be a set of orthonormal bases of the principal subspace and corresponds to the predefined classes; 3) the dot-product operation yields compact representation for image embeddings as segmentation masks. Experiments conducted on dataset ADE20K find that DEPICT consistently outperforms its black-box counterpart, Segmenter, and it is light weight and more robust.</description>

      <title>Judge Like a Real Doctor: Dual Teacher Sample Consistency Framework for Semi-supervised Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a popular solution to alleviate the high annotation cost in medical image classification. As a main branch of SSL, consistency regularization engages in imposing consensus between the predictions of a single sample from different views, termed as Absolute Location consistency (AL-c). However, only AL-c may be insufficient. Just like when diagnosing a case in practice, besides the case itself, the doctor usually refers to certain related trustworthy cases to make more reliable decisions.Therefore, we argue that solely relying on AL-c may ignore the relative differences across samples, which we interpret as relative locations, and only exploit limited information from one perspective. To address this issue, we propose a Sample Consistency Mean Teacher (SCMT) which not only incorporates AL c but also additionally enforces consistency between the samples' relative similarities to its related samples, called Relative Location consistency (RL c). AL c and RL c conduct consistency regularization from two different perspectives, jointly extracting more diverse semantic information for classification. On the other hand, due to the highly similar structures in medical images, the sample distribution could be overly dense in feature space, making their relative locations susceptible to noise. To tackle this problem, we further develop a Sample Scatter Mean Teacher (SSMT) by utilizing contrastive learning to sparsify the sample distribution and obtain robust and effective relative locations. Extensive experiments on different datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of handwriting kinematics and pressure for differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: We present the PaHaW Parkinson's disease handwriting database, consisting of handwriting samples from Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and healthy controls. Our goal is to show that kinematic features and pressure features in handwriting can be used for the differential diagnosis of PD. Methods and Material: The database contains records from 37 PD patients and 38 healthy controls performing eight different handwriting tasks. The tasks include drawing an Archimedean spiral, repetitively writing orthographically simple syllables and words, and writing of a sentence. In addition to the conventional kinematic features related to the dynamics of handwriting, we investigated new pressure features based on the pressure exerted on the writing surface. To discriminate between PD patients and healthy subjects, three different classifiers were compared: K-nearest neighbors (K-NN), ensemble AdaBoost classifier, and support vector machines (SVM). Results: For predicting PD based on kinematic and pressure features of handwriting, the best performing model was SVM with classification accuracy of Pacc = 81.3% (sensitivity Psen = 87.4% and specificity of Pspe = 80.9%). When evaluated separately, pressure features proved to be relevant for PD diagnosis, yielding Pacc = 82.5% compared to Pacc = 75.4% using kinematic features. Conclusion: Experimental results showed that an analysis of kinematic and pressure features during handwriting can help assess subtle characteristics of handwriting and discriminate between PD patients and healthy controls.</description>

      <title>GarVerseLOD: High-Fidelity 3D Garment Reconstruction from a Single In-the-Wild Image using a Dataset with Levels of Details</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural implicit functions have brought impressive advances to the state-of-the-art of clothed human digitization from multiple or even single images. However, despite the progress, current arts still have difficulty generalizing to unseen images with complex cloth deformation and body poses. In this work, we present GarVerseLOD, a new dataset and framework that paves the way to achieving unprecedented robustness in high-fidelity 3D garment reconstruction from a single unconstrained image. Inspired by the recent success of large generative models, we believe that one key to addressing the generalization challenge lies in the quantity and quality of 3D garment data. Towards this end, GarVerseLOD collects 6,000 high-quality cloth models with fine-grained geometry details manually created by professional artists. In addition to the scale of training data, we observe that having disentangled granularities of geometry can play an important role in boosting the generalization capability and inference accuracy of the learned model. We hence craft GarVerseLOD as a hierarchical dataset with levels of details (LOD), spanning from detail-free stylized shape to pose-blended garment with pixel-aligned details. This allows us to make this highly under-constrained problem tractable by factorizing the inference into easier tasks, each narrowed down with smaller searching space. To ensure GarVerseLOD can generalize well to in-the-wild images, we propose a novel labeling paradigm based on conditional diffusion models to generate extensive paired images for each garment model with high photorealism. We evaluate our method on a massive amount of in-the-wild images. Experimental results demonstrate that GarVerseLOD can generate standalone garment pieces with significantly better quality than prior approaches.

      <title>Gradient-Guided Conditional Diffusion Models for Private Image Reconstruction: Analyzing Adversarial Impacts of Differential Privacy and Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the construction of gradient-guided conditional diffusion models for reconstructing private images, focusing on the adversarial interplay between differential privacy noise and the denoising capabilities of diffusion models. While current gradient-based reconstruction methods struggle with high-resolution images due to computational complexity and prior knowledge requirements, we propose two novel methods that require minimal modifications to the diffusion model's generation process and eliminate the need for prior knowledge. Our approach leverages the strong image generation capabilities of diffusion models to reconstruct private images starting from randomly generated noise, even when a small amount of differentially private noise has been added to the gradients. We also conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the impact of differential privacy noise on the quality of reconstructed images, revealing the relationship among noise magnitude, the architecture of attacked models, and the attacker's reconstruction capability. Additionally, extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods and the accuracy of our theoretical findings, suggesting new directions for privacy risk auditing using conditional diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised cross-modality learning for uncertainty-aware object detection and recognition in applications which lack pre-labelled training data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows how an uncertainty-aware, deep neural network can be trained to detect, recognise and localise objects in 2D RGB images, in applications lacking annotated train-ng datasets. We propose a self-supervising teacher-student pipeline, in which a relatively simple teacher classifier, trained with only a few labelled 2D thumbnails, automatically processes a larger body of unlabelled RGB-D data to teach a student network based on a modified YOLOv3 architecture. Firstly, 3D object detection with back projection is used to automatically extract and teach 2D detection and localisation information to the student network. Secondly, a weakly supervised 2D thumbnail classifier, with minimal training on a small number of hand-labelled images, is used to teach object category recognition. Thirdly, we use a Gaussian Process GP to encode and teach a robust uncertainty estimation functionality, so that the student can output confidence scores with each categorization. The resulting student significantly outperforms the same YOLO architecture trained directly on the same amount of labelled data. Our GP-based approach yields robust and meaningful uncertainty estimations for complex industrial object classifications. The end-to-end network is also capable of real-time processing, needed for robotics applications. Our method can be applied to many important industrial tasks, where labelled datasets are typically unavailable. In this paper, we demonstrate an example of detection, localisation, and object category recognition of nuclear mixed-waste materials in highly cluttered and unstructured scenes. This is critical for robotic sorting and handling of legacy nuclear waste, which poses complex environmental remediation challenges in many nuclearised nations.</description>

      <title>HFGaussian: Learning Generalizable Gaussian Human with Integrated Human Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in radiance field rendering show promising results in 3D scene representation, where Gaussian splatting-based techniques emerge as state-of-the-art due to their quality and efficiency. Gaussian splatting is widely used for various applications, including 3D human representation. However, previous 3D Gaussian splatting methods either use parametric body models as additional information or fail to provide any underlying structure, like human biomechanical features, which are essential for different applications. In this paper, we present a novel approach called HFGaussian that can estimate novel views and human features, such as the 3D skeleton, 3D key points, and dense pose, from sparse input images in real time at 25 FPS. The proposed method leverages generalizable Gaussian splatting technique to represent the human subject and its associated features, enabling efficient and generalizable reconstruction. By incorporating a pose regression network and the feature splatting technique with Gaussian splatting, HFGaussian demonstrates improved capabilities over existing 3D human methods, showcasing the potential of 3D human representations with integrated biomechanics. We thoroughly evaluate our HFGaussian method against the latest state-of-the-art techniques in human Gaussian splatting and pose estimation, demonstrating its real-time, state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Local Lesion Generation is Effective for Capsule Endoscopy Image Data Augmentation in a Limited Data Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limited medical imaging datasets challenge deep learning models by increasing risks of overfitting and reduced generalization, particularly in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), where discriminators may overfit, leading to training divergence. This constraint also impairs classification models trained on small datasets. Generative Data Augmentation (GDA) addresses this by expanding training datasets with synthetic data, although it requires training a generative model. We propose and evaluate two local lesion generation approaches to address the challenge of augmenting small medical image datasets. The first approach employs the Poisson Image Editing algorithm, a classical image processing technique, to create realistic image composites that outperform current state-of-the-art methods. The second approach introduces a novel generative method, leveraging a fine-tuned Image Inpainting GAN to synthesize realistic lesions within specified regions of real training images. A comprehensive comparison of the two proposed methods demonstrates that effective local lesion generation in a data-constrained setting allows for reaching new state-of-the-art results in capsule endoscopy lesion classification. Combination of our techniques achieves a macro F1-score of 33.07%, surpassing the previous best result by 7.84 percentage points (p.p.) on the highly imbalanced Kvasir Capsule Dataset, a benchmark for capsule endoscopy. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply a fine-tuned Image Inpainting GAN for GDA in medical imaging, demonstrating that an image-conditional GAN can be adapted effectively to limited datasets to generate high-quality examples, facilitating effective data augmentation. Additionally, we show that combining this GAN-based approach with classical image processing techniques further enhances the results.</description>

      <title>Pre-trained Visual Dynamics Representations for Efficient Policy Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-training for Reinforcement Learning (RL) with purely video data is a valuable yet challenging problem. Although in-the-wild videos are readily available and inhere a vast amount of prior world knowledge, the absence of action annotations and the common domain gap with downstream tasks hinder utilizing videos for RL pre-training. To address the challenge of pre-training with videos, we propose Pre-trained Visual Dynamics Representations (PVDR) to bridge the domain gap between videos and downstream tasks for efficient policy learning. By adopting video prediction as a pre-training task, we use a Transformer-based Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to learn visual dynamics representations. The pre-trained visual dynamics representations capture the visual dynamics prior knowledge in the videos. This abstract prior knowledge can be readily adapted to downstream tasks and aligned with executable actions through online adaptation. We conduct experiments on a series of robotics visual control tasks and verify that PVDR is an effective form for pre-training with videos to promote policy learning.</description>

      <title>On Improved Conditioning Mechanisms and Pre-training Strategies for Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale training of latent diffusion models (LDMs) has enabled unprecedented quality in image generation. However, the key components of the best performing LDM training recipes are oftentimes not available to the research community, preventing apple-to-apple comparisons and hindering the validation of progress in the field. In this work, we perform an in-depth study of LDM training recipes focusing on the performance of models and their training efficiency. To ensure apple-to-apple comparisons, we re-implement five previously published models with their corresponding recipes. Through our study, we explore the effects of (i)~the mechanisms used to condition the generative model on semantic information (e.g., text prompt) and control metadata (e.g., crop size, random flip flag, etc.) on the model performance, and (ii)~the transfer of the representations learned on smaller and lower-resolution datasets to larger ones on the training efficiency and model performance. We then propose a novel conditioning mechanism that disentangles semantic and control metadata conditionings and sets a new state-of-the-art in class-conditional generation on the ImageNet-1k dataset -- with FID improvements of 7% on 256 and 8% on 512 resolutions -- as well as text-to-image generation on the CC12M dataset -- with FID improvements of 8% on 256 and 23% on 512 resolution.</description>

      <title>Kernel Orthogonality does not necessarily imply a Decrease in Feature Map Redundancy in CNNs: Convolutional Similarity Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been heavily used in Deep Learning due to their success in various tasks. Nonetheless, it has been observed that CNNs suffer from redundancy in feature maps, leading to inefficient capacity utilization. Efforts to mitigate and solve this problem led to the emergence of multiple methods, amongst which is kernel orthogonality through variant means. In this work, we challenge the common belief that kernel orthogonality leads to a decrease in feature map redundancy, which is, supposedly, the ultimate objective behind kernel orthogonality. We prove, theoretically and empirically, that kernel orthogonality has an unpredictable effect on feature map similarity and does not necessarily decrease it. Based on our theoretical result, we propose an effective method to reduce feature map similarity independently of the input of the CNN. This is done by minimizing a novel loss function we call Convolutional Similarity. Empirical results show that minimizing the Convolutional Similarity increases the performance of classification models and can accelerate their convergence. Furthermore, using our proposed method pushes towards a more efficient use of the capacity of models, allowing the use of significantly smaller models to achieve the same levels of performance.</description>

      <title>Topograph: An efficient Graph-Based Framework for Strictly Topology Preserving Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological correctness plays a critical role in many image segmentation tasks, yet most networks are trained using pixel-wise loss functions, such as Dice, neglecting topological accuracy. Existing topology-aware methods often lack robust topological guarantees, are limited to specific use cases, or impose high computational costs. In this work, we propose a novel, graph-based framework for topologically accurate image segmentation that is both computationally efficient and generally applicable. Our method constructs a component graph that fully encodes the topological information of both the prediction and ground truth, allowing us to efficiently identify topologically critical regions and aggregate a loss based on local neighborhood information. Furthermore, we introduce a strict topological metric capturing the homotopy equivalence between the union and intersection of prediction-label pairs. We formally prove the topological guarantees of our approach and empirically validate its effectiveness on binary and multi-class datasets. Our loss demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with up to fivefold faster loss computation compared to persistent homology methods.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Fine Detail and Global Geometry for Compressed Depth Map Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering high-quality depth maps from compressed sources has gained significant attention due to the limitations of consumer-grade depth cameras and the bandwidth restrictions during data transmission. However, current methods still suffer from two challenges. First, bit-depth compression produces a uniform depth representation in regions with subtle variations, hindering the recovery of detailed information. Second, densely distributed random noise reduces the accuracy of estimating the global geometric structure of the scene. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, termed geometry-decoupled network (GDNet), for compressed depth map super-resolution that decouples the high-quality depth map reconstruction process by handling global and detailed geometric features separately. To be specific, we propose the fine geometry detail encoder (FGDE), which is designed to aggregate fine geometry details in high-resolution low-level image features while simultaneously enriching them with complementary information from low-resolution context-level image features. In addition, we develop the global geometry encoder (GGE) that aims at suppressing noise and extracting global geometric information effectively via constructing compact feature representation in a low-rank space. We conduct experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our GDNet significantly outperforms current methods in terms of geometric consistency and detail recovery. In the ECCV 2024 AIM Compressed Depth Upsampling Challenge, our solution won the 1st place award. Our codes will be available.</description>

      <title>ShadowMamba: State-Space Model with Boundary-Region Selective Scan for Shadow Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image shadow removal is a typical low-level vision problem, where the presence of shadows leads to abrupt changes in brightness in certain regions, affecting the accuracy of upstream tasks. Current shadow removal methods still face challenges such as residual boundary artifacts, and capturing feature information at shadow boundaries is crucial for removing shadows and eliminating residual boundary artifacts. Recently, Mamba has achieved remarkable success in computer vision by globally modeling long-sequence information with linear complexity. However, when applied to image shadow removal, the original Mamba scanning method overlooks the semantic continuity of shadow boundaries as well as the continuity of semantics within the same region. Based on the unique characteristics of shadow images, this paper proposes a novel selective scanning method called boundary-region selective scanning. This method scans boundary regions, shadow regions, and non-shadow regions independently, bringing pixels of the same region type closer together in the long sequence, especially focusing on the local information at the boundaries, which is crucial for shadow removal. This method combines with global scanning and channel scanning to jointly accomplish the shadow removal. We name our model ShadowMamba, the first Mamba-based model for shadow removal. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art models across most metrics on multiple datasets. The code for ShadowMamba is available at (Code will be released upon acceptance).</description>

      <title>DiT4Edit: Diffusion Transformer for Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in UNet-based image editing, methods for shape-aware object editing in high-resolution images are still lacking. Compared to UNet, Diffusion Transformers (DiT) demonstrate superior capabilities to effectively capture the long-range dependencies among patches, leading to higher-quality image generation. In this paper, we propose DiT4Edit, the first Diffusion Transformer-based image editing framework. Specifically, DiT4Edit uses the DPM-Solver inversion algorithm to obtain the inverted latents, reducing the number of steps compared to the DDIM inversion algorithm commonly used in UNet-based frameworks. Additionally, we design unified attention control and patches merging, tailored for transformer computation streams. This integration allows our framework to generate higher-quality edited images faster. Our design leverages the advantages of DiT, enabling it to surpass UNet structures in image editing, especially in high-resolution and arbitrary-size images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong performance of DiT4Edit across various editing scenarios, highlighting the potential of Diffusion Transformers in supporting image editing.</description>

      <title>Inference Optimal VLMs Need Only One Visual Token but Larger Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across various visual understanding and reasoning tasks. However, their real-world deployment is often constrained by high latency during inference due to substantial compute required to process the large number of input tokens (predominantly from the image) by the LLM. To reduce inference costs, one can either downsize the LLM or reduce the number of input image-tokens, the latter of which has been the focus of many recent works around token compression. However, it is unclear what the optimal trade-off is, as both the factors directly affect the VLM performance. We first characterize this optimal trade-off between the number of visual tokens and LLM parameters by establishing scaling laws that capture variations in performance with these two factors. Our results reveal a surprising trend: for visual reasoning tasks, the inference-optimal behavior in VLMs, i.e., minimum downstream error at any given fixed inference compute, is achieved when using the largest LLM that fits within the inference budget while minimizing visual token count - often to a single token. While the token reduction literature has mainly focused on maintaining base model performance by modestly reducing the token count (e.g., $5-10\times$), our results indicate that the compute-optimal inference regime requires operating under even higher token compression ratios. Based on these insights, we take some initial steps towards building approaches tailored for high token compression settings.

      <title>Classification Done Right for Vision-Language Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SuperClass, a super simple classification method for vision-language pre-training on image-text data. Unlike its contrastive counterpart CLIP who contrast with a text encoder, SuperClass directly utilizes tokenized raw text as supervised classification labels, without the need for additional text filtering or selection. Due to the absence of the text encoding as contrastive target, SuperClass does not require a text encoder and does not need to maintain a large batch size as CLIP does. SuperClass demonstrated superior performance on various downstream tasks, including classic computer vision benchmarks and vision language downstream tasks. We further explored the scaling behavior of SuperClass on model size, training length, or data size, and reported encouraging results and comparisons to CLIP. https://github.com/x-cls/superclass</description>

      <title>MME-Finance: A Multimodal Finance Benchmark for Expert-level Understanding and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, multimodal benchmarks for general domains have guided the rapid development of multimodal models on general tasks. However, the financial field has its peculiarities. It features unique graphical images (e.g., candlestick charts, technical indicator charts) and possesses a wealth of specialized financial knowledge (e.g., futures, turnover rate). Therefore, benchmarks from general fields often fail to measure the performance of multimodal models in the financial domain, and thus cannot effectively guide the rapid development of large financial models. To promote the development of large financial multimodal models, we propose MME-Finance, an bilingual open-ended and practical usage-oriented Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark. The characteristics of our benchmark are finance and expertise, which include constructing charts that reflect the actual usage needs of users (e.g., computer screenshots and mobile photography), creating questions according to the preferences in financial domain inquiries, and annotating questions by experts with 10+ years of experience in the financial industry. Additionally, we have developed a custom-designed financial evaluation system in which visual information is first introduced in the multi-modal evaluation process. Extensive experimental evaluations of 19 mainstream MLLMs are conducted to test their perception, reasoning, and cognition capabilities. The results indicate that models performing well on general benchmarks cannot do well on MME-Finance; for instance, the top-performing open-source and closed-source models obtain 65.69 (Qwen2VL-72B) and 63.18 (GPT-4o), respectively. Their performance is particularly poor in categories most relevant to finance, such as candlestick charts and technical indicator charts. In addition, we propose a Chinese version, which helps compare performance of MLLMs under a Chinese context.</description>

      <title>Generative Emotion Cause Explanation in Multimodal Conversations</title>

Abstract: Multimodal conversation, a crucial form of human communication, carries rich emotional content, making the exploration of the causes of emotions within it a research endeavor of significant importance. However, existing research on the causes of emotions typically uses clause selection methods to locate the reason utterance, without providing a detailed explanation of the emotional causes. In this paper, we propose a new task, \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{C}onversation \textbf{E}motion \textbf{C}ause \textbf{E}xplanation (MCECE), aiming to generate a detailed explanation of the emotional cause to the target utterance within a multimodal conversation scenario. Building upon the MELD dataset, we develop a new dataset (ECEM) that integrates video clips with detailed explanations of character emotions, facilitating an in-depth examination of the causal factors behind emotional expressions in multimodal conversations.A novel approach, FAME-Net, is further proposed, that harnesses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze visual data and accurately interpret the emotions conveyed through facial expressions in videos. By exploiting the contagion effect of facial emotions, FAME-Net effectively captures the emotional causes of individuals engaged in conversations. Our experimental results on the newly constructed dataset show that FAME-Net significantly outperforms several excellent large language model baselines. Code and dataset are available at \url{https://github.com/3222345200/ECEMdataset.git}</description>

Abstract: AI and deep learning are two recent innovations that have made a big difference in helping to solve problems in the clinical space. Using clinical imaging and sound examination, they also work on improving their vision so that they can spot diseases early and correctly. Because there aren't enough trained HR, clinical professionals are asking for help with innovation because it helps them adapt to more patients. Aside from serious health problems like cancer and diabetes, the effects of respiratory infections are also slowly getting worse and becoming dangerous for society. Respiratory diseases need to be found early and treated quickly, so listening to the sounds of the lungs is proving to be a very helpful tool along with chest X-rays. The presented research hopes to use deep learning ideas based on Convolutional Brain Organization to help clinical specialists by giving a detailed and thorough analysis of clinical respiratory sound data for Ongoing Obstructive Pneumonic identification. We used MFCC, Mel-Spectrogram, Chroma, Chroma (Steady Q), and Chroma CENS from the Librosa AI library in the tests we ran. The new system could also figure out how serious the infection was, whether it was mild, moderate, or severe. The test results agree with the outcome of the deep learning approach that was proposed. The accuracy of the framework arrangement has been raised to a score of 96% on the ICBHI. Also, in the led tests, we used K-Crisp Cross-Approval with ten parts to make the presentation of the new deep learning approach easier to understand. With a 96 percent accuracy rate, the suggested network is better than the rest. If you don't use cross-validation, the model is 90% accurate.</description>

      <title>NeRF-Aug: Data Augmentation for Robotics with Neural Radiance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training a policy that can generalize to unknown objects is a long standing challenge within the field of robotics. The performance of a policy often drops significantly in situations where an object in the scene was not seen during training. To solve this problem, we present NeRF-Aug, a novel method that is capable of teaching a policy to interact with objects that are not present in the dataset. This approach differs from existing approaches by leveraging the speed and photorealism of a neural radiance field for augmentation. NeRF- Aug both creates more photorealistic data and runs 3.83 times faster than existing methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on 4 tasks with 11 novel objects that have no expert demonstration data. We achieve an average 69.1% success rate increase over existing methods.

      <title>SPACE: 3D Spatial Co-operation and Exploration Framework for Robust Mapping and Coverage with Multi-Robot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In indoor environments, multi-robot visual (RGB-D) mapping and exploration hold immense potential for application in domains such as domestic service and logistics, where deploying multiple robots in the same environment can significantly enhance efficiency. However, there are two primary challenges: (1) the "ghosting trail" effect, which occurs due to overlapping views of robots impacting the accuracy and quality of point cloud reconstruction, and (2) the oversight of visual reconstructions in selecting the most effective frontiers for exploration. Given these challenges are interrelated, we address them together by proposing a new semi-distributed framework (SPACE) for spatial cooperation in indoor environments that enables enhanced coverage and 3D mapping. SPACE leverages geometric techniques, including "mutual awareness" and a "dynamic robot filter," to overcome spatial mapping constraints. Additionally, we introduce a novel spatial frontier detection system and map merger, integrated with an adaptive frontier assigner for optimal coverage balancing the exploration and reconstruction objectives. In extensive ROS-Gazebo simulations, SPACE demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches in both exploration and mapping metrics.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Spatial Clustering for Spatial Transcriptomics Utilizing High-resolution Histology Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the intricate cellular environment within biological tissues is crucial for uncovering insights into complex biological functions. While single-cell RNA sequencing has significantly enhanced our understanding of cellular states, it lacks the spatial context necessary to fully comprehend the cellular environment. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) addresses this limitation by enabling transcriptome-wide gene expression profiling while preserving spatial context. One of the principal challenges in ST data analysis is spatial clustering, which reveals spatial domains based on the spots within a tissue. Modern ST sequencing procedures typically include a high-resolution histology image, which has been shown in previous studies to be closely connected to gene expression profiles. However, current spatial clustering methods often fail to fully integrate high-resolution histology image features with gene expression data, limiting their ability to capture critical spatial and cellular interactions.
  In this study, we propose the spatial transcriptomics multi-modal clustering (stMMC) model, a novel contrastive learning-based deep learning approach that integrates gene expression data with histology image features through a multi-modal parallel graph autoencoder. We tested stMMC against four state-of-the-art baseline models: Leiden, GraphST, SpaGCN, and stLearn on two public ST datasets with 13 sample slices in total. The experiments demonstrated that stMMC outperforms all the baseline models in terms of ARI and NMI. An ablation study further validated the contributions of contrastive learning and the incorporation of histology image features.</description>

      <title>Modeling Uncertainty in 3D Gaussian Splatting through Continuous Semantic Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for probabilistically updating and rasterizing semantic maps within 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). Although previous methods have introduced algorithms which learn to rasterize features in 3D-GS for enhanced scene understanding, 3D-GS can fail without warning which presents a challenge for safety-critical robotic applications. To address this gap, we propose a method which advances the literature of continuous semantic mapping from voxels to ellipsoids, combining the precise structure of 3D-GS with the ability to quantify uncertainty of probabilistic robotic maps. Given a set of images, our algorithm performs a probabilistic semantic update directly on the 3D ellipsoids to obtain an expectation and variance through the use of conjugate priors. We also propose a probabilistic rasterization which returns per-pixel segmentation predictions with quantifiable uncertainty. We compare our method with similar probabilistic voxel-based methods to verify our extension to 3D ellipsoids, and perform ablation studies on uncertainty quantification and temporal smoothing.</description>

      <title>MM-Embed: Universal Multimodal Retrieval with Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art retrieval models typically address a straightforward search scenario, where retrieval tasks are fixed (e.g., finding a passage to answer a specific question) and only a single modality is supported for both queries and retrieved results. This paper introduces techniques for advancing information retrieval with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), enabling a broader search scenario, termed universal multimodal retrieval, where multiple modalities and diverse retrieval tasks are accommodated. To this end, we first study fine-tuning an MLLM as a bi-encoder retriever on 10 datasets with 16 retrieval tasks. Our empirical results show that the fine-tuned MLLM retriever is capable of understanding challenging queries, composed of both text and image, but underperforms a smaller CLIP retriever in cross-modal retrieval tasks due to modality bias from MLLMs. To address the issue, we propose modality-aware hard negative mining to mitigate the modality bias exhibited by MLLM retrievers. Second, we propose to continually fine-tune the universal multimodal retriever to enhance its text retrieval capability while maintaining multimodal retrieval capability. As a result, our model, MM-Embed, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multimodal retrieval benchmark M-BEIR, which spans multiple domains and tasks, while also surpassing the state-of-the-art text retrieval model, NV-Embed-v1, on MTEB retrieval benchmark. Finally, we explore to prompt the off-the-shelf MLLMs as the zero-shot rerankers to refine the ranking of the candidates from the multimodal retriever. We find that through prompt-and-reranking, MLLMs can further improve multimodal retrieval when the user queries (e.g., text-image composed queries) are more complex and challenging to understand. These findings also pave the way to advance universal multimodal retrieval in the future.</description>

      <title>ViTally Consistent: Scaling Biological Representation Learning for Cell Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale cell microscopy screens are used in drug discovery and molecular biology research to study the effects of millions of chemical and genetic perturbations on cells. To use these images in downstream analysis, we need models that can map each image into a feature space that represents diverse biological phenotypes consistently, in the sense that perturbations with similar biological effects have similar representations. In this work, we present the largest foundation model for cell microscopy data to date, a new 1.9 billion-parameter ViT-G/8 MAE trained on over 8 billion microscopy image crops. Compared to a previous published ViT-L/8 MAE, our new model achieves a 60% improvement in linear separability of genetic perturbations and obtains the best overall performance on whole-genome biological relationship recall and replicate consistency benchmarks. Beyond scaling, we developed two key methods that improve performance: (1) training on a curated and diverse dataset; and, (2) using biologically motivated linear probing tasks to search across each transformer block for the best candidate representation of whole-genome screens. We find that many self-supervised vision transformers, pretrained on either natural or microscopy images, yield significantly more biologically meaningful representations of microscopy images in their intermediate blocks than in their typically used final blocks. More broadly, our approach and results provide insights toward a general strategy for successfully building foundation models for large-scale biological data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we computed three critical exponents ($\alpha, \beta, \gamma$) for the 3D Ising model with Metropolis Algorithm using Finite-Size Scaling Analysis on six cube length scales (L=20,30,40,60,80,90), and performed a supervised Deep Learning (DL) approach (3D Convolutional Neural Network or CNN) to train a neural network on specific conformations of spin states. We find one can effectively reduce the information in thermodynamic ensemble-averaged quantities vs. reduced temperature t (magnetization per spin $&lt;m&gt;(t)$, specific heat per spin $&lt;c&gt;(t)$, magnetic susceptibility per spin $&lt;\chi&gt;(t)$) to \textit{six} latent classes. We also demonstrate our CNN on a subset of L=20 conformations and achieve a train/test accuracy of 0.92 and 0.6875, respectively. However, more work remains to be done to quantify the feasibility of computing critical exponents from the output class labels (binned $m, c, \chi$) from this approach and interpreting the results from DL models trained on systems in Condensed Matter Physics in general.</description>

      <title>Divergent Domains, Convergent Grading: Enhancing Generalization in Diabetic Retinopathy Grading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) constitutes 5% of global blindness cases. While numerous deep learning approaches have sought to enhance traditional DR grading methods, they often falter when confronted with new out-of-distribution data thereby impeding their widespread application. In this study, we introduce a novel deep learning method for achieving domain generalization (DG) in DR grading and make the following contributions. First, we propose a new way of generating image-to-image diagnostically relevant fundus augmentations conditioned on the grade of the original fundus image. These augmentations are tailored to emulate the types of shifts in DR datasets thus increase the model's robustness. Second, we address the limitations of the standard classification loss in DG for DR fundus datasets by proposing a new DG-specific loss, domain alignment loss; which ensures that the feature vectors from all domains corresponding to the same class converge onto the same manifold for better domain generalization. Third, we tackle the coupled problem of data imbalance across DR domains and classes by proposing to employ Focal loss which seamlessly integrates with our new alignment loss. Fourth, due to inevitable observer variability in DR diagnosis that induces label noise, we propose leveraging self-supervised pretraining. This approach ensures that our DG model remains robust against early susceptibility to label noise, even when only a limited dataset of non-DR fundus images is available for pretraining. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over the strong Empirical Risk Minimization baseline and other recently proposed state-of-the-art DG methods for DR grading.

      <title>Tracking Tumors under Deformation from Partial Point Clouds using Occupancy Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To track tumors during surgery, information from preoperative CT scans is used to determine their position. However, as the surgeon operates, the tumor may be deformed which presents a major hurdle for accurately resecting the tumor, and can lead to surgical inaccuracy, increased operation time, and excessive margins. This issue is particularly pronounced in robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN), where the kidney undergoes significant deformations during operation. Toward addressing this, we introduce a occupancy network-based method for the localization of tumors within kidney phantoms undergoing deformations at interactive speeds. We validate our method by introducing a 3D hydrogel kidney phantom embedded with exophytic and endophytic renal tumors. It closely mimics real tissue mechanics to simulate kidney deformation during in vivo surgery, providing excellent contrast and clear delineation of tumor margins to enable automatic threshold-based segmentation. Our findings indicate that the proposed method can localize tumors in moderately deforming kidneys with a margin of 6mm to 10mm, while providing essential volumetric 3D information at over 60Hz. This capability directly enables downstream tasks such as robotic resection.</description>

      <title>Towards more efficient agricultural practices via transformer-based crop type classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has great potential to increase crop production and resilience to climate change. Accurate maps of where crops are grown are a key input to a number of downstream policy and research applications. In this proposal, we present preliminary work showing that it is possible to accurately classify crops from time series derived from Sentinel 1 and 2 satellite imagery in Mexico using a pixel-based binary crop/non-crop time series transformer model. We also find preliminary evidence that meta-learning approaches supplemented with data from similar agro-ecological zones may improve model performance. Due to these promising results, we propose further development of this method with the goal of accurate multi-class crop classification in Jalisco, Mexico via meta-learning with a dataset comprising similar agro-ecological zones.</description>

      <title>FUSECAPS: Investigating Feature Fusion Based Framework for Capsule Endoscopy Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to improve model accuracy, generalization, and class imbalance issues, this work offers a strong methodology for classifying endoscopic images. We suggest a hybrid feature extraction method that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs), multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), and radiomics. Rich, multi-scale feature extraction is made possible by this combination, which captures both deep and handmade representations. These features are then used by a classification head to classify diseases, producing a model with higher generalization and accuracy. In this framework we have achieved a validation accuracy of 76.2% in the capsule endoscopy video frame classification task.</description>

      <title>Active Prompt Tuning Enables Gpt-40 To Do Efficient Classification Of Microscopy Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional deep learning-based methods for classifying cellular features in microscopy images require time- and labor-intensive processes for training models. Among the current limitations are major time commitments from domain experts for accurate ground truth preparation; and the need for a large amount of input image data. We previously proposed a solution that overcomes these challenges using OpenAI's GPT-4(V) model on a pilot dataset (Iba-1 immuno-stained tissue sections from 11 mouse brains). Results on the pilot dataset were equivalent in accuracy and with a substantial improvement in throughput efficiency compared to the baseline using a traditional Convolutional Neural Net (CNN)-based approach.
  The present study builds upon this framework using a second unique and substantially larger dataset of microscopy images. Our current approach uses a newer and faster model, GPT-4o, along with improved prompts. It was evaluated on a microscopy image dataset captured at low (10x) magnification from cresyl-violet-stained sections through the cerebellum of a total of 18 mouse brains (9 Lurcher mice, 9 wild-type controls). We used our approach to classify these images either as a control group or Lurcher mutant. Using 6 mice in the prompt set the results were correct classification for 11 out of the 12 mice (92%) with 96% higher efficiency, reduced image requirements, and lower demands on time and effort of domain experts compared to the baseline method (snapshot ensemble of CNN models). These results confirm that our approach is effective across multiple datasets from different brain regions and magnifications, with minimal overhead.</description>

      <title>RT-Affordance: Affordances are Versatile Intermediate Representations for Robot Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore how intermediate policy representations can facilitate generalization by providing guidance on how to perform manipulation tasks. Existing representations such as language, goal images, and trajectory sketches have been shown to be helpful, but these representations either do not provide enough context or provide over-specified context that yields less robust policies. We propose conditioning policies on affordances, which capture the pose of the robot at key stages of the task. Affordances offer expressive yet lightweight abstractions, are easy for users to specify, and facilitate efficient learning by transferring knowledge from large internet datasets. Our method, RT-Affordance, is a hierarchical model that first proposes an affordance plan given the task language, and then conditions the policy on this affordance plan to perform manipulation. Our model can flexibly bridge heterogeneous sources of supervision including large web datasets and robot trajectories. We additionally train our model on cheap-to-collect in-domain affordance images, allowing us to learn new tasks without collecting any additional costly robot trajectories. We show on a diverse set of novel tasks how RT-Affordance exceeds the performance of existing methods by over 50%, and we empirically demonstrate that affordances are robust to novel settings.

      <title>TransUNext: towards a more advanced U-shaped framework for automatic vessel segmentation in the fundus image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Automatic and accurate segmentation of fundus vessel images has become an essential prerequisite for computer-aided diagnosis of ophthalmic diseases such as diabetes mellitus. The task of high-precision retinal vessel segmentation still faces difficulties due to the low contrast between the branch ends of retinal vessels and the background, the long and thin vessel span, and the variable morphology of the optic disc and optic cup in fundus vessel images. Methods: We propose a more advanced U-shaped architecture for a hybrid Transformer and CNN: TransUNext, which integrates an Efficient Self-attention Mechanism into the encoder and decoder of U-Net to capture both local features and global dependencies with minimal computational overhead. Meanwhile, the Global Multi-Scale Fusion (GMSF) module is further introduced to upgrade skip-connections, fuse high-level semantic and low-level detailed information, and eliminate high- and low-level semantic differences. Inspired by ConvNeXt, TransNeXt Block is designed to optimize the computational complexity of each base block in U-Net and avoid the information loss caused by the compressed dimension when the information is converted between the feature spaces of different dimensions. Results: We evaluated the proposed method on four public datasets DRIVE, STARE, CHASE-DB1, and HRF. In the experimental results, the AUC (area under the ROC curve) values were 0.9867, 0.9869, 0.9910, and 0.9887, which exceeded the other state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Foundation AI Model for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models refer to artificial intelligence (AI) models that are trained on massive amounts of data and demonstrate broad generalizability across various tasks with high accuracy. These models offer versatile, one-for-many or one-for-all solutions, eliminating the need for developing task-specific AI models. Examples of such foundation models include the Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). These models have been trained on millions to billions of samples and have shown wide-ranging and accurate applications in numerous tasks such as text processing (using ChatGPT) and natural image segmentation (using SAM). In medical image segmentation - finding target regions in medical images - there is a growing need for these one-for-many or one-for-all foundation models. Such models could obviate the need to develop thousands of task-specific AI models, which is currently standard practice in the field. They can also be adapted to tasks with datasets too small for effective training. We discuss two paths to achieve foundation models for medical image segmentation and comment on progress, challenges, and opportunities. One path is to adapt or fine-tune existing models, originally developed for natural images, for use with medical images. The second path entails building models from scratch, exclusively training on medical images.</description>

      <title>FedBlock: A Blockchain Approach to Federated Learning against Backdoor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning method for training with private data locally stored in distributed machines without gathering them into one place for central learning. Despite its promises, FL is prone to critical security risks. First, because FL depends on a central server to aggregate local training models, this is a single point of failure. The server might function maliciously. Second, due to its distributed nature, FL might encounter backdoor attacks by participating clients. They can poison the local model before submitting to the server. Either type of attack, on the server or the client side, would severely degrade learning accuracy. We propose FedBlock, a novel blockchain-based FL framework that addresses both of these security risks. FedBlock is uniquely desirable in that it involves only smart contract programming, thus deployable atop any blockchain network. Our framework is substantiated with a comprehensive evaluation study using real-world datasets. Its robustness against backdoor attacks is competitive with the literature of FL backdoor defense. The latter, however, does not address the server risk as we do.</description>

      <title>Toward Robust Incomplete Multimodal Sentiment Analysis via Hierarchical Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) is an important research area that aims to understand and recognize human sentiment through multiple modalities. The complementary information provided by multimodal fusion promotes better sentiment analysis compared to utilizing only a single modality. Nevertheless, in real-world applications, many unavoidable factors may lead to situations of uncertain modality missing, thus hindering the effectiveness of multimodal modeling and degrading the model's performance. To this end, we propose a Hierarchical Representation Learning Framework (HRLF) for the MSA task under uncertain missing modalities. Specifically, we propose a fine-grained representation factorization module that sufficiently extracts valuable sentiment information by factorizing modality into sentiment-relevant and modality-specific representations through crossmodal translation and sentiment semantic reconstruction. Moreover, a hierarchical mutual information maximization mechanism is introduced to incrementally maximize the mutual information between multi-scale representations to align and reconstruct the high-level semantics in the representations. Ultimately, we propose a hierarchical adversarial learning mechanism that further aligns and adapts the latent distribution of sentiment-relevant representations to produce robust joint multimodal representations. Comprehensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that HRLF significantly improves MSA performance under uncertain modality missing cases.</description>

      <title>Specialized Foundation Models Struggle to Beat Supervised Baselines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following its success for vision and text, the "foundation model" (FM) paradigm -- pretraining large models on massive data, then fine-tuning on target tasks -- has rapidly expanded to domains in the sciences, engineering, healthcare, and beyond. Has this achieved what the original FMs accomplished, i.e. the supplanting of traditional supervised learning in their domains? To answer we look at three modalities -- genomics, satellite imaging, and time series -- with multiple recent FMs and compare them to a standard supervised learning workflow: model development, hyperparameter tuning, and training, all using only data from the target task. Across these three specialized domains, we find that it is consistently possible to train simple supervised models -- no more complicated than a lightly modified wide ResNet or UNet -- that match or even outperform the latest foundation models. Our work demonstrates that the benefits of large-scale pretraining have yet to be realized in many specialized areas, reinforces the need to compare new FMs to strong, well-tuned baselines, and introduces two new, easy-to-use, open-source, and automated workflows for doing so.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence-Enhanced Couinaud Segmentation for Precision Liver Cancer Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision therapy for liver cancer necessitates accurately delineating liver sub-regions to protect healthy tissue while targeting tumors, which is essential for reducing recurrence and improving survival rates. However, the segmentation of hepatic segments, known as Couinaud segmentation, is challenging due to indistinct sub-region boundaries and the need for extensive annotated datasets. This study introduces LiverFormer, a novel Couinaud segmentation model that effectively integrates global context with low-level local features based on a 3D hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture. Additionally, a registration-based data augmentation strategy is equipped to enhance the segmentation performance with limited labeled data. Evaluated on CT images from 123 patients, LiverFormer demonstrated high accuracy and strong concordance with expert annotations across various metrics, allowing for enhanced treatment planning for surgery and radiation therapy. It has great potential to reduces complications and minimizes potential damages to surrounding tissue, leading to improved outcomes for patients undergoing complex liver cancer treatments.</description>

      <title>Conditional Vendi Score: An Information-Theoretic Approach to Diversity Evaluation of Prompt-based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-conditioned generation models are commonly evaluated based on the quality of the generated data and its alignment with the input text prompt. On the other hand, several applications of prompt-based generative models require sufficient diversity in the generated data to ensure the models' capability of generating image and video samples possessing a variety of features. However, most existing diversity metrics are designed for unconditional generative models, and thus cannot distinguish the diversity arising from variations in text prompts and that contributed by the generative model itself. In this work, our goal is to quantify the prompt-induced and model-induced diversity in samples generated by prompt-based models. We propose an information-theoretic approach for internal diversity quantification, where we decompose the kernel-based entropy $H(X)$ of the generated data $X$ into the sum of the conditional entropy $H(X|T)$, given text variable $T$, and the mutual information $I(X; T)$ between the text and data variables. We introduce the \emph{Conditional-Vendi} score based on $H(X|T)$ to quantify the internal diversity of the model and the \emph{Information-Vendi} score based on $I(X; T)$ to measure the statistical relevance between the generated data and text prompts. We provide theoretical results to statistically interpret these scores and relate them to the unconditional Vendi score. We conduct several numerical experiments to show the correlation between the Conditional-Vendi score and the internal diversity of text-conditioned generative models.

      <title>Analyzing Poverty through Intra-Annual Time-Series: A Wavelet Transform Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing global poverty is a key objective of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Achieving this requires high-frequency, granular data to capture neighborhood-level changes, particularly in data scarce regions such as low- and middle-income countries. To fill in the data gaps, recent computer vision methods combining machine learning (ML) with earth observation (EO) data to improve poverty estimation. However, while much progress have been made, they often omit intra-annual variations, which are crucial for estimating poverty in agriculturally dependent countries. We explored the impact of integrating intra-annual NDVI information with annual multi-spectral data on model accuracy. To evaluate our method, we created a simulated dataset using Landsat imagery and nighttime light data to evaluate EO-ML methods that use intra-annual EO data. Additionally, we evaluated our method against the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) dataset across Africa. Our results indicate that integrating specific NDVI-derived features with multi-spectral data provides valuable insights for poverty analysis, emphasizing the importance of retaining intra-annual information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate tissue segmentation in fetal brain MRI remains challenging due to the dynamically changing anatomical anatomy and contrast during fetal development. To enhance segmentation accuracy throughout gestation, we introduced AtlasSeg, a dual-U-shape convolution network incorporating gestational age (GA) specific information as guidance. By providing a publicly available fetal brain atlas with segmentation label at the corresponding GA, AtlasSeg effectively extracted the contextual features of age-specific patterns in atlas branch and generated tissue segmentation in segmentation branch. Multi-scale attentive atlas feature fusions were constructed in all stages during encoding and decoding, giving rise to a dual-U-shape network to assist feature flow and information interactions between two branches. AtlasSeg outperformed six well-known segmentation networks in both our internal fetal brain MRI dataset and the external FeTA dataset. Ablation experiments demonstrate the efficiency of atlas guidance and the attention mechanism. The proposed AtlasSeg demonstrated superior segmentation performance against other convolution networks with higher segmentation accuracy, and may facilitate fetal brain MRI analysis in large-scale fetal brain studies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Adversarial Robustness via Uncertainty-Aware Distributional Adversarial Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite remarkable achievements in deep learning across various domains, its inherent vulnerability to adversarial examples still remains a critical concern for practical deployment. Adversarial training has emerged as one of the most effective defensive techniques for improving model robustness against such malicious inputs. However, existing adversarial training schemes often lead to limited generalization ability against underlying adversaries with diversity due to their overreliance on a point-by-point augmentation strategy by mapping each clean example to its adversarial counterpart during training. In addition, adversarial examples can induce significant disruptions in the statistical information w.r.t. the target model, thereby introducing substantial uncertainty and challenges to modeling the distribution of adversarial examples. To circumvent these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware distributional adversarial training method, which enforces adversary modeling by leveraging both the statistical information of adversarial examples and its corresponding uncertainty estimation, with the goal of augmenting the diversity of adversaries. Considering the potentially negative impact induced by aligning adversaries to misclassified clean examples, we also refine the alignment reference based on the statistical proximity to clean examples during adversarial training, thereby reframing adversarial training within a distribution-to-distribution matching framework interacted between the clean and adversarial domains. Furthermore, we design an introspective gradient alignment approach via matching input gradients between these domains without introducing external models. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and various network architectures demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art adversarial robustness and maintains natural performance.</description>

      <title>A Symmetric Dynamic Learning Framework for Diffeomorphic Medical Image Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffeomorphic image registration is crucial for various medical imaging applications because it can preserve the topology of the transformation. This study introduces DCCNN-LSTM-Reg, a learning framework that evolves dynamically and learns a symmetrical registration path by satisfying a specified control increment system. This framework aims to obtain symmetric diffeomorphic deformations between moving and fixed images. To achieve this, we combine deep learning networks with diffeomorphic mathematical mechanisms to create a continuous and dynamic registration architecture, which consists of multiple Symmetric Registration (SR) modules cascaded on five different scales. Specifically, our method first uses two U-nets with shared parameters to extract multiscale feature pyramids from the images. We then develop an SR-module comprising a sequential CNN-LSTM architecture to progressively correct the forward and reverse multiscale deformation fields using control increment learning and the homotopy continuation technique. Through extensive experiments on three 3D registration tasks, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</description>

      <title>LDPM: Towards undersampled MRI reconstruction with MR-VAE and Latent Diffusion Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion model, as a powerful generative model, has found a wide range of applications including MRI reconstruction. However, most existing diffusion model-based MRI reconstruction methods operate directly in pixel space, which makes their optimization and inference computationally expensive. Latent diffusion models were introduced to address this problem in natural image processing, but directly applying them to MRI reconstruction still faces many challenges, including the lack of control over the generated results, the adaptability of Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to MRI, and the exploration of applicable data consistency in latent space. To address these challenges, a Latent Diffusion Prior based undersampled MRI reconstruction (LDPM) method is proposed. A sketcher module is utilized to provide appropriate control and balance the quality and fidelity of the reconstructed MR images. A VAE adapted for MRI tasks (MR-VAE) is explored, which can serve as the backbone for future MR-related tasks. Furthermore, a variation of the DDIM sampler, called the Dual-Stage Sampler, is proposed to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction in the latent space. The proposed method achieves competitive results on fastMRI datasets, and the effectiveness of each module is demonstrated in ablation experiments.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Effective Adaptation of Multimodal Foundation Models in Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal foundation models (MFMs) have revolutionized sequential recommender systems through advanced representation learning. While Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) is commonly used to adapt these models, studies often prioritize parameter efficiency, neglecting GPU memory and training speed. To address this, we introduced the IISAN framework, significantly enhancing efficiency. However, IISAN was limited to symmetrical MFMs and identical text and image encoders, preventing the use of state-of-the-art Large Language Models. To overcome this, we developed IISAN-Versa, a versatile plug-and-play architecture compatible with both symmetrical and asymmetrical MFMs. IISAN-Versa employs a Decoupled PEFT structure and utilizes both intra- and inter-modal adaptation. It effectively handles asymmetry through a simple yet effective combination of group layer-dropping and dimension transformation alignment. Our research demonstrates that IISAN-Versa effectively adapts large text encoders, and we further identify a scaling effect where larger encoders generally perform better. IISAN-Versa also demonstrates strong versatility in our defined multimodal scenarios, which include raw titles and captions generated from images and videos. Additionally, IISAN-Versa achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Microlens public benchmark. We will release our code and datasets to support future research.</description>

      <title>FEDLAD: Federated Evaluation of Deep Leakage Attacks and Defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning is a privacy preserving decentralized machine learning paradigm designed to collaboratively train models across multiple clients by exchanging gradients to the server and keeping private data local. Nevertheless, recent research has revealed that the security of Federated Learning is compromised, as private ground truth data can be recovered through a gradient inversion technique known as Deep Leakage. While these attacks are crafted with a focus on applications in Federated Learning, they generally are not evaluated in realistic scenarios. This paper introduces the FEDLAD Framework (Federated Evaluation of Deep Leakage Attacks and Defenses), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Deep Leakage attacks and defenses within a realistic Federated context. By implementing a unified benchmark that encompasses multiple state-of-the-art Deep Leakage techniques and various defense strategies, our framework facilitates the evaluation and comparison of the efficacy of these methods across different datasets and training states. This work highlights a crucial trade-off between privacy and model accuracy in Federated Learning and aims to advance the understanding of security challenges in decentralized machine learning systems, stimulate future research, and enhance reproducibility in evaluating Deep Leakage attacks and defenses.</description>

      <title>ATM: Improving Model Merging by Alternating Tuning and Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model merging has recently emerged as a cost-efficient paradigm for multi-task learning. Among current approaches, task arithmetic stands out for its simplicity and effectiveness. In this paper, we motivate the effectiveness of task vectors by linking them to multi-task gradients. We show that in a single-epoch scenario, task vectors are mathematically equivalent to the gradients obtained via gradient descent in a multi-task setting, and still approximate these gradients in subsequent epochs. Furthermore, we show that task vectors perform optimally when equality is maintained, and their effectiveness is largely driven by the first epoch's gradient. Building on this insight, we propose viewing model merging as a single step in an iterative process that Alternates between Tuning and Merging (ATM). This method acts as a bridge between model merging and multi-task gradient descent, achieving state-of-the-art results with the same data and computational requirements. We extensively evaluate ATM across diverse settings, achieving up to 20% higher accuracy in computer vision and NLP tasks, compared to the best baselines.Finally, we provide both empirical and theoretical support for its effectiveness, demonstrating increased orthogonality between task vectors and proving that ATM minimizes an upper bound on the loss obtained by jointly finetuning all tasks.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for Lung Segmentation in Chest X-ray Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM), a new AI model from Meta AI released in April 2023, is an ambitious tool designed to identify and separate individual objects within a given image through semantic interpretation. The advanced capabilities of SAM are the result of its training with millions of images and masks, and a few days after its release, several researchers began testing the model on medical images to evaluate its performance in this domain. With this perspective in focus -- i.e., optimizing work in the healthcare field -- this work proposes the use of this new technology to evaluate and study chest X-ray images. The approach adopted for this work, with the aim of improving the model's performance for lung segmentation, involved a transfer learning process, specifically the fine-tuning technique. After applying this adjustment, a substantial improvement was observed in the evaluation metrics used to assess SAM's performance compared to the masks provided by the datasets. The results obtained by the model after the adjustments were satisfactory and similar to cutting-edge neural networks, such as U-Net.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Applicability of a Snapshot Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer for the Prediction of Brix and pH of Grapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a recently developed snapshot hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system based on Computed Tomography Imaging Spectroscopy (CTIS) is utilized to determine Brix and pH values in Sheegene 20 table grapes through Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) modeling. The performance of the CTIS system is compared with that of a state-of-the-art line scan HSI system by imaging 100 grapes across both platforms. Reference measurements of Brix and pH values are obtained directly using a refractometer and a pH meter, as these parameters are essential for assessing the quality of table and wine grapes. The findings indicate that the spectra captured by the CTIS camera correlate well with the reference measurements, despite the system's narrower spectral range. The CTIS camera's advantages, including its lower cost, portability, and reduced susceptibility to motion errors, highlight its potential for promising in-field applications in grape quality assessment.</description>

      <title>MA^2: A Self-Supervised and Motion Augmenting Autoencoder for Gait-Based Automatic Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground reaction force (GRF) is the force exerted by the ground on a body in contact with it. GRF-based automatic disease detection (ADD) has become an emerging medical diagnosis method, which aims to learn and identify disease patterns corresponding to different gait pressures based on deep learning methods. Although existing ADD methods can save doctors time in making diagnoses, training deep models still struggles with the cost caused by the labeling engineering for a large number of gait diagnostic data for subjects. On the other hand, the accuracy of the deep model under the unified benchmark GRF dataset and the generalization ability on scalable gait datasets need to be further improved. To address these issues, we propose MA2, a GRF-based self-supervised and motion augmenting auto-encoder, which models the ADD task as an encoder-decoder paradigm. In the encoder, we introduce an embedding block including the 3-layer 1D convolution for extracting the token and a mask generator to randomly mask out the sequence of tokens to maximize the model's potential to capture high-level, discriminative, intrinsic representations. whereafter, the decoder utilizes this information to reconstruct the pixel sequence of the origin input and calculate the reconstruction loss to optimize the network. Moreover, the backbone of an auto-encoder is multi-head self-attention that can consider the global information of the token from the input, not just the local neighborhood. This allows the model to capture generalized contextual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate MA2 has SOTA performance of 90.91% accuracy on 1% limited pathological GRF samples with labels, and good generalization ability of 78.57% accuracy on scalable Parkinson disease dataset.</description>

      <title>Beyond Grid Data: Exploring Graph Neural Networks for Earth Observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) data analysis has been significantly revolutionized by deep learning (DL), with applications typically limited to grid-like data structures. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) emerge as an important innovation, propelling DL into the non-Euclidean domain. Naturally, GNNs can effectively tackle the challenges posed by diverse modalities, multiple sensors, and the heterogeneous nature of EO data. To introduce GNNs in the related domains, our review begins by offering fundamental knowledge on GNNs. Then, we summarize the generic problems in EO, to which GNNs can offer potential solutions. Following this, we explore a broad spectrum of GNNs' applications to scientific problems in Earth systems, covering areas such as weather and climate analysis, disaster management, air quality monitoring, agriculture, land cover classification, hydrological process modeling, and urban modeling. The rationale behind adopting GNNs in these fields is explained, alongside methodologies for organizing graphs and designing favorable architectures for various tasks. Furthermore, we highlight methodological challenges of implementing GNNs in these domains and possible solutions that could guide future research. While acknowledging that GNNs are not a universal solution, we conclude the paper by comparing them with other popular architectures like transformers and analyzing their potential synergies.</description>

Abstract: In the era of Generative AI, Neurosymbolic AI is emerging as a powerful approach for tasks spanning from perception to cognition. The use of Neurosymbolic AI has been shown to achieve enhanced capabilities, including improved grounding, alignment, explainability, and reliability. However, due to its nascent stage, there is a lack of widely available real-world benchmark datasets tailored to Neurosymbolic AI tasks. To address this gap and support the evaluation of current and future methods, we introduce DSceneKG -- a suite of knowledge graphs of driving scenes built from real-world, high-quality scenes from multiple open autonomous driving datasets. In this article, we detail the construction process of DSceneKG and highlight its application in seven different tasks.

Abstract: Mirrors can degrade the performance of computer vision models, but research into detecting them is in the preliminary phase. YOLOv4 achieves phenomenal results in terms of object detection accuracy and speed, but it still fails in detecting mirrors. Thus, we propose Mirror-YOLO, which targets mirror detection, containing a novel attention focus mechanism for features acquisition, a hypercolumn-stairstep approach to better fusion the feature maps, and the mirror bounding polygons for instance segmentation. Compared to the existing mirror detection networks and YOLO series, our proposed network achieves superior performance in average accuracy on our proposed mirror dataset and another state-of-art mirror dataset, which demonstrates the validity and effectiveness of Mirror-YOLO.</description>

      <title>RIAV-MVS: Recurrent-Indexing an Asymmetric Volume for Multi-View Stereo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.14320v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based method for multi-view depth estimation from posed images. Our core idea is a "learning-to-optimize" paradigm that iteratively indexes a plane-sweeping cost volume and regresses the depth map via a convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Since the cost volume plays a paramount role in encoding the multi-view geometry, we aim to improve its construction both at pixel- and frame- levels. At the pixel level, we propose to break the symmetry of the Siamese network (which is typically used in MVS to extract image features) by introducing a transformer block to the reference image (but not to the source images). Such an asymmetric volume allows the network to extract global features from the reference image to predict its depth map. Given potential inaccuracies in the poses between reference and source images, we propose to incorporate a residual pose network to correct the relative poses. This essentially rectifies the cost volume at the frame level. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world MVS datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both within-dataset evaluation and cross-dataset generalization.

      <title>MS-DETR: Multispectral Pedestrian Detection Transformer with Loosely Coupled Fusion and Modality-Balanced Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00290v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multispectral pedestrian detection is an important task for many around-the-clock applications, since the visible and thermal modalities can provide complementary information especially under low light conditions. Due to the presence of two modalities, misalignment and modality imbalance are the most significant issues in multispectral pedestrian detection. In this paper, we propose M ulti S pectral pedestrian DE tection TR ansformer (MS-DETR) to fix above issues. MS-DETR consists of two modality-specific backbones and Transformer encoders, followed by a multi-modal Transformer decoder, and the visible and thermal features are fused in the multi-modal Transformer decoder. To well resist the misalignment between multi-modal images, we design a loosely coupled fusion strategy by sparsely sampling some keypoints from multi-modal features independently and fusing them with adaptively learned attention weights. Moreover, based on the insight that not only different modalities, but also different pedestrian instances tend to have different confidence scores to final detection, we further propose an instance-aware modality-balanced optimization strategy, which preserves visible and thermal decoder branches and aligns their predicted slots through an instance-wise dynamic loss. Our end-to-end MS-DETR shows superior performance on the challenging KAIST, CVC-14 and LLVIP benchmark datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/YinghuiXing/MS-DETR.</description>

      <title>Class-Conditioned Transformation for Enhanced Robust Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust classification methods predominantly concentrate on algorithms that address a specific threat model, resulting in ineffective defenses against other threat models. Real-world applications are exposed to this vulnerability, as malicious attackers might exploit alternative threat models. In this work, we propose a novel test-time threat model agnostic algorithm that enhances Adversarial-Trained (AT) models. Our method operates through COnditional image transformation and DIstance-based Prediction (CODIP) and includes two main steps: First, we transform the input image into each dataset class, where the input image might be either clean or attacked. Next, we make a prediction based on the shortest transformed distance. The conditional transformation utilizes the perceptually aligned gradients property possessed by AT models and, as a result, eliminates the need for additional models or additional training. Moreover, it allows users to choose the desired balance between clean and robust accuracy without training. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results demonstrated through extensive experiments on various models, AT methods, datasets, and attack types. Notably, applying CODIP leads to substantial robust accuracy improvement of up to $+23\%$, $+20\%$, $+26\%$, and $+22\%$ on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet and Flowers datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Diversifying Deep Ensembles: A Saliency Map Approach for Enhanced OOD Detection, Calibration, and Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11616v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep ensembles are capable of achieving state-of-the-art results in classification and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, their effectiveness is limited due to the homogeneity of learned patterns within ensembles. To overcome this issue, our study introduces Saliency Diversified Deep Ensemble (SDDE), a novel approach that promotes diversity among ensemble members by leveraging saliency maps. Through incorporating saliency map diversification, our method outperforms conventional ensemble techniques and improves calibration in multiple classification and OOD detection tasks. In particular, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection quality, calibration, and accuracy on multiple benchmarks, including CIFAR10/100 and large-scale ImageNet datasets.</description>

      <title>S-JEA: Stacked Joint Embedding Architectures for Self-Supervised Visual Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent emergence of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) as a fundamental paradigm for learning image representations has, and continues to, demonstrate high empirical success in a variety of tasks. However, most SSL approaches fail to learn embeddings that capture hierarchical semantic concepts that are separable and interpretable. In this work, we aim to learn highly separable semantic hierarchical representations by stacking Joint Embedding Architectures (JEA) where higher-level JEAs are input with representations of lower-level JEA. This results in a representation space that exhibits distinct sub-categories of semantic concepts (e.g., model and colour of vehicles) in higher-level JEAs. We empirically show that representations from stacked JEA perform on a similar level as traditional JEA with comparative parameter counts and visualise the representation spaces to validate the semantic hierarchies.</description>

      <title>FASTER: A Font-Agnostic Scene Text Editing and Rendering Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scene Text Editing (STE) is a challenging research problem, that primarily aims towards modifying existing texts in an image while preserving the background and the font style of the original text. Despite its utility in numerous real-world applications, existing style-transfer-based approaches have shown sub-par editing performance due to (1) complex image backgrounds, (2) diverse font attributes, and (3) varying word lengths within the text. To address such limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel font-agnostic scene text editing and rendering framework, named FASTER, for simultaneously generating text in arbitrary styles and locations while preserving a natural and realistic appearance and structure. A combined fusion of target mask generation and style transfer units, with a cascaded self-attention mechanism has been proposed to focus on multi-level text region edits to handle varying word lengths. Extensive evaluation on a real-world database with further subjective human evaluation study indicates the superiority of FASTER in both scene text editing and rendering tasks, in terms of model performance and efficiency. Our code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>CoVR-2: Automatic Data Construction for Composed Video Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14746v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CoIR) has recently gained popularity as a task that considers both text and image queries together, to search for relevant images in a database. Most CoIR approaches require manually annotated datasets, comprising image-text-image triplets, where the text describes a modification from the query image to the target image. However, manual curation of CoIR triplets is expensive and prevents scalability. In this work, we instead propose a scalable automatic dataset creation methodology that generates triplets given video-caption pairs, while also expanding the scope of the task to include composed video retrieval (CoVR). To this end, we mine paired videos with a similar caption from a large database, and leverage a large language model to generate the corresponding modification text. Applying this methodology to the extensive WebVid2M collection, we automatically construct our WebVid-CoVR dataset, resulting in 1.6 million triplets. Moreover, we introduce a new benchmark for CoVR with a manually annotated evaluation set, along with baseline results. We further validate that our methodology is equally applicable to image-caption pairs, by generating 3.3 million CoIR training triplets using the Conceptual Captions dataset. Our model builds on BLIP-2 pretraining, adapting it to composed video (or image) retrieval, and incorporates an additional caption retrieval loss to exploit extra supervision beyond the triplet. We provide extensive ablations to analyze the design choices on our new CoVR benchmark. Our experiments also demonstrate that training a CoVR model on our datasets effectively transfers to CoIR, leading to improved state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot setup on the CIRR, FashionIQ, and CIRCO benchmarks. Our code, datasets, and models are publicly available at https://imagine.enpc.fr/ ventural/covr.</description>

      <title>GlobalDoc: A Cross-Modal Vision-Language Framework for Real-World Document Image Retrieval and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual document understanding (VDU) has rapidly advanced with the development of powerful multi-modal language models. However, these models typically require extensive document pre-training data to learn intermediate representations and often suffer a significant performance drop in real-world online industrial settings. A primary issue is their heavy reliance on OCR engines to extract local positional information within document pages, which limits the models' ability to capture global information and hinders their generalizability, flexibility, and robustness. In this paper, we introduce GlobalDoc, a cross-modal transformer-based architecture pre-trained in a self-supervised manner using three novel pretext objective tasks. GlobalDoc improves the learning of richer semantic concepts by unifying language and visual representations, resulting in more transferable models. For proper evaluation, we also propose two novel document-level downstream VDU tasks, Few-Shot Document Image Classification (DIC) and Content-based Document Image Retrieval (DIR), designed to simulate industrial scenarios more closely. Extensive experimentation has been conducted to demonstrate GlobalDoc's effectiveness in practical settings.</description>

      <title>Unified Human-Scene Interaction via Prompted Chain-of-Contacts</title>

Abstract: Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) is a vital component of fields like embodied AI and virtual reality. Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes.

      <title>Seeing Eye to AI: Comparing Human Gaze and Model Attention in Video Memorability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding what makes a video memorable has important applications in advertising or education technology. Towards this goal, we investigate spatio-temporal attention mechanisms underlying video memorability. Different from previous works that fuse multiple features, we adopt a simple CNN+Transformer architecture that enables analysis of spatio-temporal attention while matching state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on video memorability prediction. We compare model attention against human gaze fixations collected through a small-scale eye-tracking study where humans perform the video memory task. We uncover the following insights: (i) Quantitative saliency metrics show that our model, trained only to predict a memorability score, exhibits similar spatial attention patterns to human gaze, especially for more memorable videos. (ii) The model assigns greater importance to initial frames in a video, mimicking human attention patterns. (iii) Panoptic segmentation reveals that both (model and humans) assign a greater share of attention to things and less attention to stuff as compared to their occurrence probability.</description>

      <title>Contextual Knowledge Pursuit for Faithful Visual Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern text-to-vision generative models often hallucinate when the prompt describing the scene to be generated is underspecified. In large language models (LLMs), a prevalent strategy to reduce hallucinations is to retrieve factual knowledge from an external database. While such retrieval augmentation strategies have great potential to enhance text-to-vision generators, existing static top-K retrieval methods explore the knowledge pool once, missing the broader context necessary for high-quality generation. Furthermore, LLMs internally possess rich world knowledge learned during large-scale training (parametric knowledge) that could mitigate the need for external data retrieval. This paper proposes Contextual Knowledge Pursuit (CKPT), a framework that leverages the complementary strengths of external and parametric knowledge to help generators produce reliable visual content. Instead of the one-time retrieval of facts from an external database to improve a given prompt, CKPT uses (1) an LLM to decide whether to seek external knowledge or to self-elicit descriptions from LLM parametric knowledge, (2) a knowledge pursuit process to contextually seek and sequentially gather most relevant facts, (3) a knowledge aggregator for prompt enhancement with the gathered fact context, and (4) a filtered fine-tuning objective to improve visual synthesis with richer prompts. We evaluate CKPT across multiple text-driven generative tasks (image, 3D rendering, and video) on datasets of rare objects and daily scenarios. Our results show that CKPT is capable of generating faithful and semantically rich content across diverse visual domains, offering a promising data source for zero-shot synthesis and filtered fine-tuning of text-to-vision generative models.</description>

      <title>Passive Non-Line-of-Sight Imaging with Light Transport Modulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Passive non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging has witnessed rapid development in recent years, due to its ability to image objects that are out of sight. The light transport condition plays an important role in this task since changing the conditions will lead to different imaging models. Existing learning-based NLOS methods usually train independent models for different light transport conditions, which is computationally inefficient and impairs the practicality of the models. In this work, we propose NLOS-LTM, a novel passive NLOS imaging method that effectively handles multiple light transport conditions with a single network. We achieve this by inferring a latent light transport representation from the projection image and using this representation to modulate the network that reconstructs the hidden image from the projection image. We train a light transport encoder together with a vector quantizer to obtain the light transport representation. To further regulate this representation, we jointly learn both the reconstruction network and the reprojection network during training. A set of light transport modulation blocks is used to modulate the two jointly trained networks in a multi-scale way. Extensive experiments on a large-scale passive NLOS dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/JerryOctopus/NLOS-LTM.</description>

      <title>Robustly overfitting latents for flexible neural image compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural image compression has made a great deal of progress. State-of-the-art models are based on variational autoencoders and are outperforming classical models. Neural compression models learn to encode an image into a quantized latent representation that can be efficiently sent to the decoder, which decodes the quantized latent into a reconstructed image. While these models have proven successful in practice, they lead to sub-optimal results due to imperfect optimization and limitations in the encoder and decoder capacity. Recent work shows how to use stochastic Gumbel annealing (SGA) to refine the latents of pre-trained neural image compression models. We extend this idea by introducing SGA+, which contains three different methods that build upon SGA. We show how our method improves the overall compression performance in terms of the R-D trade-off, compared to its predecessors. Additionally, we show how refinement of the latents with our best-performing method improves the compression performance on both the Tecnick and CLIC dataset. Our method is deployed for a pre-trained hyperprior and for a more flexible model. Further, we give a detailed analysis of our proposed methods and show that they are less sensitive to hyperparameter choices. Finally, we show how each method can be extended to three- instead of two-class rounding.</description>

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, using negative prompts, which describe undesirable image characteristics, can significantly boost image quality. However, producing good negative prompts is manual and tedious. To address this, we propose NegOpt, a novel method for optimizing negative prompt generation toward enhanced image generation, using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Our combined approach results in a substantial increase of 25% in Inception Score compared to other approaches and surpasses ground-truth negative prompts from the test set. Furthermore, with NegOpt we can preferentially optimize the metrics most important to us. Finally, we construct Negative Prompts DB (https://huggingface.co/datasets/mikeogezi/negopt_full), a publicly available dataset of negative prompts.</description>

      <title>Attention-based Class-Conditioned Alignment for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation of Object Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09918v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain adaptation methods for object detection (OD) strive to mitigate the impact of distribution shifts by promoting feature alignment across source and target domains. Multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) allows leveraging multiple annotated source datasets and unlabeled target data to improve the accuracy and robustness of the detection model. Most state-of-the-art MSDA methods for OD perform feature alignment in a class-agnostic manner. This is challenging since the objects have unique modal information due to variations in object appearance across domains. A recent prototype-based approach proposed a class-wise alignment, yet it suffers from error accumulation due to noisy pseudo-labels that can negatively affect adaptation with imbalanced data. To overcome these limitations, we propose an attention-based class-conditioned alignment method for MSDA that aligns instances of each object category across domains. In particular, an attention module coupled with an adversarial domain classifier allows learning domain-invariant and class-specific instance representations. Experimental results on multiple benchmarking MSDA datasets indicate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and is robust to class imbalance using a conceptually simple class-conditioning method. Our code is available at https://github.com/imatif17/ACIA.</description>

      <title>DeblurDiNAT: A Generalizable Transformer for Perceptual Image Deblurring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13163v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) deblurring networks achieve high metric scores on synthetic datasets, there are two challenges which prevent them from perceptual image deblurring. First, a deblurring model overtrained on synthetic datasets may collapse in a broad range of unseen real-world scenarios. Second, the conventional metrics PSNR and SSIM may not correctly reflect the perceptual quality observed by human eyes. To this end, we propose DeblurDiNAT, a generalizable and efficient encoder-decoder Transformer which restores clean images visually close to the ground truth. We adopt an alternating dilation factor structure to capture local and global blur patterns. We propose a local cross-channel learner to assist self-attention layers to learn short-range cross-channel relationships. In addition, we present a linear feed-forward network and a non-linear dual-stage feature fusion module for faster feature propagation across the network. Compared to nearest competitors, our model demonstrates the strongest generalization ability and achieves the best perceptual quality on mainstream image deblurring datasets with 3%-68% fewer parameters.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Pseudo-labeling for Semi-Supervised Monocular 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We delve into pseudo-labeling for semi-supervised monocular 3D object detection (SSM3OD) and discover two primary issues: a misalignment between the prediction quality of 3D and 2D attributes and the tendency of depth supervision derived from pseudo-labels to be noisy, leading to significant optimization conflicts with other reliable forms of supervision. We introduce a novel decoupled pseudo-labeling (DPL) approach for SSM3OD. Our approach features a Decoupled Pseudo-label Generation (DPG) module, designed to efficiently generate pseudo-labels by separately processing 2D and 3D attributes. This module incorporates a unique homography-based method for identifying dependable pseudo-labels in BEV space, specifically for 3D attributes. Additionally, we present a DepthGradient Projection (DGP) module to mitigate optimization conflicts caused by noisy depth supervision of pseudo-labels, effectively decoupling the depth gradient and removing conflicting gradients. This dual decoupling strategy-at both the pseudo-label generation and gradient levels-significantly improves the utilization of pseudo-labels in SSM3OD. Our comprehensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>VHM: Versatile and Honest Vision Language Model for Remote Sensing Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a Versatile and Honest vision language Model (VHM) for remote sensing image analysis. VHM is built on a large-scale remote sensing image-text dataset with rich-content captions (VersaD), and an honest instruction dataset comprising both factual and deceptive questions (HnstD). Unlike prevailing remote sensing image-text datasets, in which image captions focus on a few prominent objects and their relationships, VersaD captions provide detailed information about image properties, object attributes, and the overall scene. This comprehensive captioning enables VHM to thoroughly understand remote sensing images and perform diverse remote sensing tasks. Moreover, different from existing remote sensing instruction datasets that only include factual questions, HnstD contains additional deceptive questions stemming from the non-existence of objects. This feature prevents VHM from producing affirmative answers to nonsense queries, thereby ensuring its honesty. In our experiments, VHM significantly outperforms various vision language models on common tasks of scene classification, visual question answering, and visual grounding. Additionally, VHM achieves competent performance on several unexplored tasks, such as building vectorizing, multi-label classification and honest question answering.</description>

Abstract: The performance of perception tasks is heavily influenced by imaging systems. However, designing cameras with high task performance is costly, requiring extensive camera knowledge and experimentation with physical hardware. Additionally, cameras and perception tasks are mostly designed in isolation, whereas recent methods that jointly design cameras and tasks have shown improved performance. Therefore, we present a novel end-to-end optimization approach that co-designs cameras with specific vision tasks. This method combines derivative-free and gradient-based optimizers to support both continuous and discrete camera parameters within manufacturing constraints. We leverage recent computer graphics techniques and physical camera characteristics to simulate the cameras in virtual environments, making the design process cost-effective. We validate our simulations against physical cameras and provide a procedurally generated virtual environment. Our experiments demonstrate that our method designs cameras that outperform common off-the-shelf options, and more efficiently compared to the state-of-the-art approach, requiring only 2 minutes to design a camera on an example experiment compared with 67 minutes for the competing method. Designed to support the development of cameras under manufacturing constraints, multiple cameras, and unconventional cameras, we believe this approach can advance the fully automated design of cameras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text animation serves as an expressive medium, transforming static communication into dynamic experiences by infusing words with motion to evoke emotions, emphasize meanings, and construct compelling narratives. Crafting animations that are semantically aware poses significant challenges, demanding expertise in graphic design and animation. We present an automated text animation scheme, termed "Dynamic Typography", which combines two challenging tasks. It deforms letters to convey semantic meaning and infuses them with vibrant movements based on user prompts. Our technique harnesses vector graphics representations and an end-to-end optimization-based framework. This framework employs neural displacement fields to convert letters into base shapes and applies per-frame motion, encouraging coherence with the intended textual concept. Shape preservation techniques and perceptual loss regularization are employed to maintain legibility and structural integrity throughout the animation process. We demonstrate the generalizability of our approach across various text-to-video models and highlight the superiority of our end-to-end methodology over baseline methods, which might comprise separate tasks. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in generating coherent text animations that faithfully interpret user prompts while maintaining readability.

      <title>Implicit Neural Representations for Robust Joint Sparse-View CT Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is pivotal in industrial quality control and medical diagnostics. Sparse-view CT, offering reduced ionizing radiation, faces challenges due to its under-sampled nature, leading to ill-posed reconstruction problems. Recent advancements in Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have shown promise in addressing sparse-view CT reconstruction. Recognizing that CT often involves scanning similar subjects, we propose a novel approach to improve reconstruction quality through joint reconstruction of multiple objects using INRs. This approach can potentially utilize the advantages of INRs and the common patterns observed across different objects. While current INR joint reconstruction techniques primarily focus on speeding up the learning process, they are not specifically tailored to enhance the final reconstruction quality. To address this gap, we introduce a novel INR-based Bayesian framework integrating latent variables to capture the common patterns across multiple objects under joint reconstruction. The common patterns then assist in the reconstruction of each object via latent variables, thereby improving the individual reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves higher reconstruction quality with sparse views and remains robust to noise in the measurements as indicated by common numerical metrics. The obtained latent variables can also serve as network initialization for the new object and speed up the learning process.</description>

      <title>Seeing the Image: Prioritizing Visual Correlation by Contrastive Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing image-text modality alignment in Vision Language Models (VLMs) treats each text token equally in an autoregressive manner. Despite being simple and effective, this method results in sub-optimal cross-modal alignment by over-emphasizing the text tokens that are less correlated with or even contradictory with the input images. In this paper, we advocate for assigning distinct contributions for each text token based on its visual correlation. Specifically, we present by contrasting image inputs, the difference in prediction logits on each text token provides strong guidance of visual correlation. We therefore introduce Contrastive ALignment (CAL), a simple yet effective re-weighting strategy that prioritizes training visually correlated tokens. Our experimental results demonstrate that CAL consistently improves different types of VLMs across different resolutions and model sizes on various benchmark datasets. Importantly, our method incurs minimal additional computational overhead, rendering it highly efficient compared to alternative data scaling strategies. Codes are available at https://github.com/foundation-multimodal-models/CAL.</description>

      <title>Blind Image Restoration via Fast Diffusion Inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image Restoration (IR) methods based on a pre-trained diffusion model have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, they have two fundamental limitations: 1) they often assume that the degradation operator is completely known and 2) they alter the diffusion sampling process, which may result in restored images that do not lie onto the data manifold. To address these issues, we propose Blind Image Restoration via fast Diffusion inversion (BIRD) a blind IR method that jointly optimizes for the degradation model parameters and the restored image. To ensure that the restored images lie onto the data manifold, we propose a novel sampling technique on a pre-trained diffusion model. A key idea in our method is not to modify the reverse sampling, i.e, not to alter all the intermediate latents, once an initial noise is sampled. This is ultimately equivalent to casting the IR task as an optimization problem in the space of the input noise. Moreover, to mitigate the computational cost associated with inverting a fully unrolled diffusion model, we leverage the inherent capability of these models to skip ahead in the forward diffusion process using large time steps. We experimentally validate BIRD on several image restoration tasks and show that it achieves state of the art performance on all of them. Our code is available at https://github.com/hamadichihaoui/BIRD.</description>

      <title>Stable-Pose: Leveraging Transformers for Pose-Guided Text-to-Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controllable text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown impressive performance in generating high-quality visual content through the incorporation of various conditions. Current methods, however, exhibit limited performance when guided by skeleton human poses, especially in complex pose conditions such as side or rear perspectives of human figures. To address this issue, we present Stable-Pose, a novel adapter model that introduces a coarse-to-fine attention masking strategy into a vision Transformer (ViT) to gain accurate pose guidance for T2I models. Stable-Pose is designed to adeptly handle pose conditions within pre-trained Stable Diffusion, providing a refined and efficient way of aligning pose representation during image synthesis. We leverage the query-key self-attention mechanism of ViTs to explore the interconnections among different anatomical parts in human pose skeletons. Masked pose images are used to smoothly refine the attention maps based on target pose-related features in a hierarchical manner, transitioning from coarse to fine levels. Additionally, our loss function is formulated to allocate increased emphasis to the pose region, thereby augmenting the model's precision in capturing intricate pose details. We assessed the performance of Stable-Pose across five public datasets under a wide range of indoor and outdoor human pose scenarios. Stable-Pose achieved an AP score of 57.1 in the LAION-Human dataset, marking around 13% improvement over the established technique ControlNet.

      <description>arXiv:2406.04802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal fusion is crucial in joint decision-making systems for rendering holistic judgments. Since multimodal data changes in open environments, dynamic fusion has emerged and achieved remarkable progress in numerous applications. However, most existing dynamic multimodal fusion methods lack theoretical guarantees and easily fall into suboptimal problems, yielding unreliability and instability. To address this issue, we propose a Predictive Dynamic Fusion (PDF) framework for multimodal learning. We proceed to reveal the multimodal fusion from a generalization perspective and theoretically derive the predictable Collaborative Belief (Co-Belief) with Mono- and Holo-Confidence, which provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error. Accordingly, we further propose a relative calibration strategy to calibrate the predicted Co-Belief for potential uncertainty. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm our superiority.

      <title>Latent Representation Matters: Human-like Sketches in One-shot Drawing Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans can effortlessly draw new categories from a single exemplar, a feat that has long posed a challenge for generative models. However, this gap has started to close with recent advances in diffusion models. This one-shot drawing task requires powerful inductive biases that have not been systematically investigated. Here, we study how different inductive biases shape the latent space of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). Along with standard LDM regularizers (KL and vector quantization), we explore supervised regularizations (including classification and prototype-based representation) and contrastive inductive biases (using SimCLR and redundancy reduction objectives). We demonstrate that LDMs with redundancy reduction and prototype-based regularizations produce near-human-like drawings (regarding both samples' recognizability and originality) -- better mimicking human perception (as evaluated psychophysically). Overall, our results suggest that the gap between humans and machines in one-shot drawings is almost closed.</description>

      <title>DenoiseRep: Denoising Model for Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08773v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The denoising model has been proven a powerful generative model but has little exploration of discriminative tasks. Representation learning is important in discriminative tasks, which is defined as "learning representations (or features) of the data that make it easier to extract useful information when building classifiers or other predictors". In this paper, we propose a novel Denoising Model for Representation Learning (DenoiseRep) to improve feature discrimination with joint feature extraction and denoising. DenoiseRep views each embedding layer in a backbone as a denoising layer, processing the cascaded embedding layers as if we are recursively denoise features step-by-step. This unifies the frameworks of feature extraction and denoising, where the former progressively embeds features from low-level to high-level, and the latter recursively denoises features step-by-step. After that, DenoiseRep fuses the parameters of feature extraction and denoising layers, and theoretically demonstrates its equivalence before and after the fusion, thus making feature denoising computation-free. DenoiseRep is a label-free algorithm that incrementally improves features but also complementary to the label if available. Experimental results on various discriminative vision tasks, including re-identification (Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, MSMT17, CUHK-03, vehicleID), image classification (ImageNet, UB200, Oxford-Pet, Flowers), object detection (COCO), image segmentation (ADE20K) show stability and impressive improvements. We also validate its effectiveness on the CNN (ResNet) and Transformer (ViT, Swin, Vmamda) architectures.</description>

      <title>Understanding Multi-Granularity for Open-Vocabulary Part Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary part segmentation (OVPS) is an emerging research area focused on segmenting fine-grained entities using diverse and previously unseen vocabularies. Our study highlights the inherent complexities of part segmentation due to intricate boundaries and diverse granularity, reflecting the knowledge-based nature of part identification. To address these challenges, we propose PartCLIPSeg, a novel framework utilizing generalized parts and object-level contexts to mitigate the lack of generalization in fine-grained parts. PartCLIPSeg integrates competitive part relationships and attention control, alleviating ambiguous boundaries and underrepresented parts. Experimental results demonstrate that PartCLIPSeg outperforms existing state-of-the-art OVPS methods, offering refined segmentation and an advanced understanding of part relationships within images. Through extensive experiments, our model demonstrated a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art models on the Pascal-Part-116, ADE20K-Part-234, and PartImageNet datasets.</description>

      <title>Is A Picture Worth A Thousand Words? Delving Into Spatial Reasoning for Vision Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks and domains. Despite this promise, spatial understanding and reasoning -- a fundamental component of human cognition -- remains under-explored. We propose SpatialEval, a novel benchmark that covers diverse aspects of spatial reasoning such as relationship understanding, navigation, and counting. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of competitive language and vision-language models. Our findings reveal several counter-intuitive insights that have been overlooked in the literature: (1) Spatial reasoning poses significant challenges where competitive models can fall behind random guessing; (2) Despite additional visual input, VLMs often under-perform compared to their LLM counterparts; (3) When both textual and visual information is available, multi-modal language models become less reliant on visual information if sufficient textual clues are provided. Additionally, we demonstrate that leveraging redundancy between vision and text can significantly enhance model performance. We hope our study will inform the development of multimodal models to improve spatial intelligence and further close the gap with human intelligence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing texture-less surfaces poses unique challenges in computer vision, primarily due to the lack of specialized datasets that cater to the nuanced needs of depth and normals estimation in the absence of textural information. We introduce "Shape2.5D," a novel, large-scale dataset designed to address this gap. Comprising 1.17 million frames spanning over 39,772 3D models and 48 unique objects, our dataset provides depth and surface normal maps for texture-less object reconstruction. The proposed dataset includes synthetic images rendered with 3D modeling software to simulate various lighting conditions and viewing angles. It also includes a real-world subset comprising 4,672 frames captured with a depth camera. Our comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate the dataset's ability to support the development of algorithms that robustly estimate depth and normals from RGB images and perform voxel reconstruction. Our open-source data generation pipeline allows the dataset to be extended and adapted for future research. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/saifkhichi96/Shape25D.</description>

      <title>D3: Deep Deconvolution Deblurring for Natural Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to reformulate the blind image deblurring task to directly learn an inverse of the degradation model represented by a deep linear network. We introduce Deep Identity Learning (DIL), a novel learning strategy that includes a dedicated regularization term based on the properties of linear systems, to exploit the identity relation between the degradation and inverse degradation models. The salient aspect of our proposed framework is it neither relies on a deblurring dataset nor a single input blurry image (e.g. Polyblur, a self-supervised method). This framework detours the typical degradation kernel estimation step involved in most of the existing blind deblurring solutions by the proposition of our Random Kernel Gallery (RKG) dataset. The proposed approach extends our previous Image Super-Resolution (ISR) work, NSSR-DIL, to the image deblurring task. In this work, we updated the regularization term in DIL based on Fourier transform properties of the identity relation, to deliver robust performance across a wide range of degradations. Besides the regularization term, we provide an explicit and compact representation of the learned deep linear network in a matrix form, called Deep Restoration Kernel (DRK) to perform image restoration. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms both traditional and deep learning based deblurring methods, with at least an order of 100 lesser computational resources. The D3 model, both LCNN &amp; DRK, can be effortlessly extended to the Image Super-Resolution (ISR) task as well to restore the low-resolution images with fine details. The D3 model and its kernel form representation (DRK) are lightweight yet robust and restore the blurry input in a fraction of a second.</description>

      <title>3DGS.zip: A survey on 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression Methods</title>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a cutting-edge technique for real-time radiance field rendering, offering state-of-the-art performance in terms of both quality and speed. 3DGS models a scene as a collection of three-dimensional Gaussians, or splats, with additional attributes optimized to conform to the scene's geometric and visual properties. Despite its advantages in rendering speed and image fidelity, 3DGS is limited by its significant storage and memory demands. These high demands make 3DGS impractical for mobile devices or headsets, reducing its applicability in important areas of computer graphics. To address these challenges and advance the practicality of 3DGS, this survey provides a comprehensive and detailed examination of compression and compaction techniques developed to make 3DGS more efficient. We categorize current approaches into compression techniques, which aim at achieving the highest quality at minimal data size, and compaction techniques, which aim for optimal quality with the fewest Gaussians. We introduce the basic mathematical concepts underlying the analyzed methods, as well as key implementation details and design choices. Our report thoroughly discusses similarities and differences among the methods, as well as their respective advantages and disadvantages. We establish a consistent standard for comparing these methods based on key performance metrics and datasets. Specifically, since these methods have been developed in parallel and over a short period of time, currently, no comprehensive comparison exists. This survey, for the first time, presents a unified standard to evaluate 3DGS compression techniques. To facilitate the continuous monitoring of emerging methodologies, we maintain a dedicated website that will be regularly updated with new techniques and revisions of existing findings https://w-m.github.io/3dgs-compression-survey/ .</description>

      <title>Edge AI-Enabled Chicken Health Detection Based on Enhanced FCOS-Lite and Knowledge Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The utilization of AIoT technology has become a crucial trend in modern poultry management, offering the potential to optimize farming operations and reduce human workloads. This paper presents a real-time and compact edge-AI enabled detector designed to identify chickens and their healthy statuses using frames captured by a lightweight and intelligent camera equipped with an edge-AI enabled CMOS sensor. To ensure efficient deployment of the proposed compact detector within the memory-constrained edge-AI enabled CMOS sensor, we employ a FCOS-Lite detector leveraging MobileNet as the backbone. To mitigate the issue of reduced accuracy in compact edge-AI detectors without incurring additional inference costs, we propose a gradient weighting loss function as classification loss and introduce CIOU loss function as localization loss. Additionally, we propose a knowledge distillation scheme to transfer valuable information from a large teacher detector to the proposed FCOS-Lite detector, thereby enhancing its performance while preserving a compact model size. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed edge-AI enabled detector achieves commendable performance metrics, including a mean average precision (mAP) of 95.1$\%$ and an F1-score of 94.2$\%$, etc. Notably, the proposed detector can be efficiently deployed and operates at a speed exceeding 20 FPS on the edge-AI enabled CMOS sensor, achieved through int8 quantization. That meets practical demands for automated poultry health monitoring using lightweight intelligent cameras with low power consumption and minimal bandwidth costs.</description>

      <title>Sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG): point cloud-based iterative algorithm for large-scale 3D photoacoustic imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale 3D photoacoustic (PA) imaging has become increasingly important for both clinical and pre-clinical applications. Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments. The source code and data for SlingBAG, along with supplementary materials and demonstration videos, are now available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/SlingBAG.</description>

      <title>EchoSight: Advancing Visual-Language Models with Wiki Knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) tasks require answering questions about images using extensive background knowledge. Despite significant advancements, generative models often struggle with these tasks due to the limited integration of external knowledge. In this paper, we introduce EchoSight, a novel multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to answer visual questions requiring fine-grained encyclopedic knowledge. To strive for high-performing retrieval, EchoSight first searches wiki articles by using visual-only information, subsequently, these candidate articles are further reranked according to their relevance to the combined text-image query. This approach significantly improves the integration of multimodal knowledge, leading to enhanced retrieval outcomes and more accurate VQA responses. Our experimental results on the Encyclopedic VQA and InfoSeek datasets demonstrate that EchoSight establishes new state-of-the-art results in knowledge-based VQA, achieving an accuracy of 41.8% on Encyclopedic VQA and 31.3% on InfoSeek.</description>

      <title>Establishing Causal Relationship Between Whole Slide Image Predictions and Diagnostic Evidence Subregions in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the lack of fine-grained annotation guidance, current Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) struggles to establish a robust causal relationship between Whole Slide Image (WSI) diagnosis and evidence sub-images, just like fully supervised learning. So many noisy images can undermine the network's prediction. The proposed Causal Inference Multiple Instance Learning (CI-MIL), uses out-of-distribution generalization to reduce the recognition confusion of sub-images by MIL network, without requiring pixelwise annotations. Specifically, feature distillation is introduced to roughly identify the feature representation of lesion patches. Then, in the random Fourier feature space, these features are re-weighted to minimize the cross-correlation, effectively correcting the feature distribution deviation. These processes reduce the uncertainty when tracing the prediction results back to patches. Predicted diagnoses are more direct and reliable because the causal relationship between them and diagnostic evidence images is more clearly recognized by the network. Experimental results demonstrate that CI-MIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 92.25% accuracy and 95.28% AUC on the Camelyon16 dataset (breast cancer), while 94.29% accuracy and 98.07% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC dataset (non-small cell lung cancer). Additionally, CI-MIL exhibits superior interpretability, as its selected regions demonstrate high consistency with ground truth annotations, promising more reliable diagnostic assistance for pathologists.</description>

      <title>Target Detection of Safety Protective Gear Using the Improved YOLOv5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high-risk railway construction, personal protective equipment monitoring is critical but challenging due to small and frequently obstructed targets. We propose YOLO-EA, an innovative model that enhances safety measure detection by integrating ECA into its backbone's convolutional layers, improving discernment of minuscule objects like hardhats. YOLO-EA further refines target recognition under occlusion by replacing GIoU with EIoU loss. YOLO-EA's effectiveness was empirically substantiated using a dataset derived from real-world railway construction site surveillance footage. It outperforms YOLOv5, achieving 98.9% precision and 94.7% recall, up 2.5% and 0.5% respectively, while maintaining real-time performance at 70.774 fps. This highly efficient and precise YOLO-EA holds great promise for practical application in intricate construction scenarios, enforcing stringent safety compliance during complex railway construction projects.</description>

      <title>POINTS: Improving Your Vision-language Model with Affordable Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, vision-language models have made significant strides, excelling in tasks like optical character recognition and geometric problem-solving. However, several critical issues remain: 1) Proprietary models often lack transparency about their architectures, while open-source models need more detailed ablations of their training strategies. 2) Pre-training data in open-source works is under-explored, with datasets added empirically, making the process cumbersome. 3) Fine-tuning often focuses on adding datasets, leading to diminishing returns. To address these issues, we propose the following contributions: 1) We trained a robust baseline model using the latest advancements in vision-language models, introducing effective improvements and conducting comprehensive ablation and validation for each technique. 2) Inspired by recent work on large language models, we filtered pre-training data using perplexity, selecting the lowest perplexity data for training. This approach allowed us to train on a curated 1M dataset, achieving competitive performance. 3) During visual instruction tuning, we used model soup on different datasets when adding more datasets yielded marginal improvements. These innovations resulted in a 9B parameter model that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. Our strategies are efficient and lightweight, making them easily adoptable by the community.</description>

      <title>CollaMamba: Efficient Collaborative Perception with Cross-Agent Spatial-Temporal State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07714v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By sharing complementary perceptual information, multi-agent collaborative perception fosters a deeper understanding of the environment. Recent studies on collaborative perception mostly utilize CNNs or Transformers to learn feature representation and fusion in the spatial dimension, which struggle to handle long-range spatial-temporal features under limited computing and communication resources. Holistically modeling the dependencies over extensive spatial areas and extended temporal frames is crucial to enhancing feature quality. To this end, we propose a resource efficient cross-agent spatial-temporal collaborative state space model (SSM), named CollaMamba. Initially, we construct a foundational backbone network based on spatial SSM. This backbone adeptly captures positional causal dependencies from both single-agent and cross-agent views, yielding compact and comprehensive intermediate features while maintaining linear complexity. Furthermore, we devise a history-aware feature boosting module based on temporal SSM, extracting contextual cues from extended historical frames to refine vague features while preserving low overhead. Extensive experiments across several datasets demonstrate that CollaMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher model accuracy while reducing computational and communication overhead by up to 71.9% and 1/64, respectively. This work pioneers the exploration of the Mamba's potential in collaborative perception. The source code will be made available.</description>

      <title>DeBaRA: Denoising-Based 3D Room Arrangement Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating realistic and diverse layouts of furnished indoor 3D scenes unlocks multiple interactive applications impacting a wide range of industries. The inherent complexity of object interactions, the limited amount of available data and the requirement to fulfill spatial constraints all make generative modeling for 3D scene synthesis and arrangement challenging. Current methods address these challenges autoregressively or by using off-the-shelf diffusion objectives by simultaneously predicting all attributes without 3D reasoning considerations. In this paper, we introduce DeBaRA, a score-based model specifically tailored for precise, controllable and flexible arrangement generation in a bounded environment. We argue that the most critical component of a scene synthesis system is to accurately establish the size and position of various objects within a restricted area. Based on this insight, we propose a lightweight conditional score-based model designed with 3D spatial awareness at its core. We demonstrate that by focusing on spatial attributes of objects, a single trained DeBaRA model can be leveraged at test time to perform several downstream applications such as scene synthesis, completion and re-arrangement. Further, we introduce a novel Self Score Evaluation procedure so it can be optimally employed alongside external LLM models. We evaluate our approach through extensive experiments and demonstrate significant improvement upon state-of-the-art approaches in a range of scenarios.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we explore Self-supervised Learning (SSL) as an auxiliary task to blend the texture-based local descriptors into feature modelling for efficient face analysis. Combining a primary task and a self-supervised auxiliary task is beneficial for robust representation. Therefore, we used the SSL task of mask auto-encoder (MAE) as an auxiliary task to reconstruct texture features such as local patterns along with the primary task for robust and unbiased face analysis. We experimented with our hypothesis on three major paradigms of face analysis: face attribute and face-based emotion analysis, and deepfake detection. Our experiment results exhibit that better feature representation can be gleaned from our proposed model for fair and bias-less face analysis.</description>

      <title>ACE: All-round Creator and Editor Following Instructions via Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful generative technology and have been found to be applicable in various scenarios. Most existing foundational diffusion models are primarily designed for text-guided visual generation and do not support multi-modal conditions, which are essential for many visual editing tasks. This limitation prevents these foundational diffusion models from serving as a unified model in the field of visual generation, like GPT-4 in the natural language processing field. In this work, we propose ACE, an All-round Creator and Editor, which achieves comparable performance compared to those expert models in a wide range of visual generation tasks. To achieve this goal, we first introduce a unified condition format termed Long-context Condition Unit (LCU), and propose a novel Transformer-based diffusion model that uses LCU as input, aiming for joint training across various generation and editing tasks. Furthermore, we propose an efficient data collection approach to address the issue of the absence of available training data. It involves acquiring pairwise images with synthesis-based or clustering-based pipelines and supplying these pairs with accurate textual instructions by leveraging a fine-tuned multi-modal large language model. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of our model, we establish a benchmark of manually annotated pairs data across a variety of visual generation tasks. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model in visual generation fields. Thanks to the all-in-one capabilities of our model, we can easily build a multi-modal chat system that responds to any interactive request for image creation using a single model to serve as the backend, avoiding the cumbersome pipeline typically employed in visual agents. Code and models will be available on the project page: https://ali-vilab.github.io/ace-page/.</description>

      <title>SynCo: Synthetic Hard Negatives in Contrastive Learning for Better Unsupervised Visual Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02401v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has become a dominant approach in self-supervised visual representation learning. Hard negatives - samples closely resembling the anchor - are key to enhancing learned representations' discriminative power. However, efficiently leveraging hard negatives remains challenging. We introduce SynCo (Synthetic Negatives in Contrastive learning), a novel approach that improves model performance by generating synthetic hard negatives on the representation space. Building on the MoCo framework, SynCo introduces six strategies for creating diverse synthetic hard negatives on-the-fly with minimal computational overhead. SynCo achieves faster training and better representation learning, reaching 67.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 linear evaluation after 200 pretraining epochs, surpassing MoCo's 67.5% using the same ResNet-50 encoder. It also transfers more effectively to detection tasks: on PASCAL VOC, it outperforms both the supervised baseline and MoCo with 82.5% AP; on COCO, it sets new benchmarks with 40.9% AP for bounding box detection and 35.5% AP for instance segmentation. Our synthetic hard negative generation approach significantly enhances visual representations learned through self-supervised contrastive learning.

      <title>FakeShield: Explainable Image Forgery Detection and Localization via Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of generative AI is a double-edged sword, which not only facilitates content creation but also makes image manipulation easier and more difficult to detect. Although current image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) methods are generally effective, they tend to face two challenges: \textbf{1)} black-box nature with unknown detection principle, \textbf{2)} limited generalization across diverse tampering methods (e.g., Photoshop, DeepFake, AIGC-Editing). To address these issues, we propose the explainable IFDL task and design FakeShield, a multi-modal framework capable of evaluating image authenticity, generating tampered region masks, and providing a judgment basis based on pixel-level and image-level tampering clues. Additionally, we leverage GPT-4o to enhance existing IFDL datasets, creating the Multi-Modal Tamper Description dataSet (MMTD-Set) for training FakeShield's tampering analysis capabilities. Meanwhile, we incorporate a Domain Tag-guided Explainable Forgery Detection Module (DTE-FDM) and a Multi-modal Forgery Localization Module (MFLM) to address various types of tamper detection interpretation and achieve forgery localization guided by detailed textual descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FakeShield effectively detects and localizes various tampering techniques, offering an explainable and superior solution compared to previous IFDL methods.</description>

      <title>DAAL: Density-Aware Adaptive Line Margin Loss for Multi-Modal Deep Metric Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-modal deep metric learning is crucial for effectively capturing diverse representations in tasks such as face verification, fine-grained object recognition, and product search. Traditional approaches to metric learning, whether based on distance or margin metrics, primarily emphasize class separation, often overlooking the intra-class distribution essential for multi-modal feature learning. In this context, we propose a novel loss function called Density-Aware Adaptive Margin Loss(DAAL), which preserves the density distribution of embeddings while encouraging the formation of adaptive sub-clusters within each class. By employing an adaptive line strategy, DAAL not only enhances intra-class variance but also ensures robust inter-class separation, facilitating effective multi-modal representation.

      <title>Dynamic Multimodal Evaluation with Flexible Complexity by Vision-Language Bootstrapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across multimodal tasks such as visual perception and reasoning, leading to good performance on various multimodal evaluation benchmarks. However, these benchmarks keep a static nature and overlap with the pre-training data, resulting in fixed complexity constraints and data contamination issues. This raises the concern regarding the validity of the evaluation. To address these two challenges, we introduce a dynamic multimodal evaluation protocol called Vision-Language Bootstrapping (VLB). VLB provides a robust and comprehensive assessment for LVLMs with reduced data contamination and flexible complexity. To this end, VLB dynamically generates new visual question-answering samples through a multimodal bootstrapping module that modifies both images and language, while ensuring that newly generated samples remain consistent with the original ones by a judge module. By composing various bootstrapping strategies, VLB offers dynamic variants of existing benchmarks with diverse complexities, enabling the evaluation to co-evolve with the ever-evolving capabilities of LVLMs. Extensive experimental results across multiple benchmarks, including SEEDBench, MMBench, and MME, show that VLB significantly reduces data contamination and exposes performance limitations of LVLMs.</description>

      <title>Leveraging generative models to characterize the failure conditions of image classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address in this work the question of identifying the failure conditions of a given image classifier. To do so, we exploit the capacity of producing controllable distributions of high quality image data made available by recent Generative Adversarial Networks (StyleGAN2): the failure conditions are expressed as directions of strong performance degradation in the generative model latent space. This strategy of analysis is used to discover corner cases that combine multiple sources of corruption, and to compare in more details the behavior of different classifiers. The directions of degradation can also be rendered visually by generating data for better interpretability. Some degradations such as image quality can affect all classes, whereas other ones such as shape are more class-specific. The approach is demonstrated on the MNIST dataset that has been completed by two sources of corruption: noise and blur, and shows a promising way to better understand and control the risks of exploiting Artificial Intelligence components for safety-critical applications.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Misalignment in Vision-Language Model Adaptation from a Causal Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundational Vision-Language models such as CLIP have exhibited impressive generalization in downstream tasks. However, CLIP suffers from a two-level misalignment issue, i.e., task misalignment and data misalignment, when adapting to specific tasks. Soft prompt tuning has mitigated the task misalignment, yet the data misalignment remains a challenge. To analyze the impacts of the data misalignment, we revisit the pre-training and adaptation processes of CLIP and develop a structural causal model. We discover that while we expect to capture task-relevant information for downstream tasks accurately, the task-irrelevant knowledge impacts the prediction results and hampers the modeling of the true relationships between the images and the predicted classes. As task-irrelevant knowledge is unobservable, we leverage the front-door adjustment and propose Causality-Guided Semantic Decoupling and Classification (CDC) to mitigate the interference of task-irrelevant knowledge. Specifically, we decouple semantics contained in the data of downstream tasks and perform classification based on each semantic. Furthermore, we employ the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory to evaluate the uncertainty of each prediction generated by diverse semantics. Experiments conducted in multiple different settings have consistently demonstrated the effectiveness of CDC.</description>

      <title>UniVST: A Unified Framework for Training-free Localized Video Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents UniVST, a unified framework for localized video style transfer. It operates without the need for training, offering a distinct advantage over existing methods that transfer style across entire videos. The endeavors of this paper comprise: (1) A point-matching mask propagation strategy that leverages feature maps from the DDIM inversion. This streamlines the model's architecture by obviating the need for tracking models. (2) An AdaIN-guided style transfer mechanism that operates at both the latent and attention levels. This balances content fidelity and style richness, mitigating the loss of localized details commonly associated with direct video stylization. (3) A sliding window smoothing strategy that harnesses optical flow within the pixel representation and refines predicted noise to update the latent space. This significantly enhances temporal consistency and diminishes artifacts in video outputs. Our proposed UniVST has been validated to be superior to existing methods in quantitative and qualitative metrics. It adeptly addresses the challenges of preserving the primary object's style while ensuring temporal consistency and detail preservation.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Perception Machine For Efficient Test-Time-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose Asynchronous Perception Machine (APM), a computationally-efficient architecture for test-time-training (TTT). APM can process patches of an image one at a time in any order asymmetrically and still encode semantic-awareness in the net. We demonstrate APM's ability to recognize out-of-distribution images without dataset-specific pre-training, augmentation or any-pretext task. APM offers competitive performance over existing TTT approaches. To perform TTT, APM just distills test sample's representation once. APM possesses a unique property: it can learn using just this single representation and starts predicting semantically-aware features.
  APM demostrates potential applications beyond test-time-training: APM can scale up to a dataset of 2D images and yield semantic-clusterings in a single forward pass. APM also provides first empirical evidence towards validating GLOM's insight, i.e. input percept is a field. Therefore, APM helps us converge towards an implementation which can do both interpolation and perception on a shared-connectionist hardware. Our code is publicly available at this link: https://rajatmodi62.github.io/apm_project_page/.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Real-Time Volcano-Seismic Event Recognition Based on Multi-Station Seismograms and Semantic Segmentation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In volcano monitoring, effective recognition of seismic events is essential for understanding volcanic activity and raising timely warning alerts. Traditional methods rely on manual analysis, which can be subjective and labor-intensive. Furthermore, current automatic approaches often tackle detection and classification separately, mostly rely on single station information and generally require tailored preprocessing and representations to perform predictions. These limitations often hinder their application to real-time monitoring and utilization across different volcano conditions. This study introduces a novel approach that utilizes Semantic Segmentation models to automate seismic event recognition by applying a straight forward transformation of multi-channel 1D signals into 2D representations, enabling their use as images. Our framework employs a data-driven, end-to-end design that integrates multi-station seismic data with minimal preprocessing, performing both detection and classification simultaneously for five seismic event classes. We evaluated four state-of-the-art segmentation models (UNet, UNet++, DeepLabV3+ and SwinUNet) on approximately 25.000 seismic events recorded at four different Chilean volcanoes: Nevados del Chill\'an Volcanic Complex, Laguna del Maule, Villarrica and Puyehue-Cord\'on Caulle. Among these models, the UNet architecture was identified as the most effective model, achieving mean F1 and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of up to 0.91 and 0.88, respectively, and demonstrating superior noise robustness and model flexibility to unseen volcano datasets.</description>

      <title>Extrapolating Prospective Glaucoma Fundus Images through Diffusion Model in Irregular Longitudinal Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The utilization of longitudinal datasets for glaucoma progression prediction offers a compelling approach to support early therapeutic interventions. Predominant methodologies in this domain have primarily focused on the direct prediction of glaucoma stage labels from longitudinal datasets. However, such methods may not adequately encapsulate the nuanced developmental trajectory of the disease. To enhance the diagnostic acumen of medical practitioners, we propose a novel diffusion-based model to predict prospective images by extrapolating from existing longitudinal fundus images of patients. The methodology delineated in this study distinctively leverages sequences of images as inputs. Subsequently, a time-aligned mask is employed to select a specific year for image generation. During the training phase, the time-aligned mask resolves the issue of irregular temporal intervals in longitudinal image sequence sampling. Additionally, we utilize a strategy of randomly masking a frame in the sequence to establish the ground truth. This methodology aids the network in continuously acquiring knowledge regarding the internal relationships among the sequences throughout the learning phase. Moreover, the introduction of textual labels is instrumental in categorizing images generated within the sequence. The empirical findings from the conducted experiments indicate that our proposed model not only effectively generates longitudinal data but also significantly improves the precision of downstream classification tasks.</description>

      <title>RelationBooth: Towards Relation-Aware Customized Object Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Customized image generation is crucial for delivering personalized content based on user-provided image prompts, aligning large-scale text-to-image diffusion models with individual needs. However, existing models often overlook the relationships between customized objects in generated images. Instead, this work addresses that gap by focusing on relation-aware customized image generation, which aims to preserve the identities from image prompts while maintaining the predicate relations described in text prompts. Specifically, we introduce RelationBooth, a framework that disentangles identity and relation learning through a well-curated dataset. Our training data consists of relation-specific images, independent object images containing identity information, and text prompts to guide relation generation. Then, we propose two key modules to tackle the two main challenges: generating accurate and natural relations, especially when significant pose adjustments are required, and avoiding object confusion in cases of overlap. First, we introduce a keypoint matching loss that effectively guides the model in adjusting object poses closely tied to their relationships. Second, we incorporate local features from the image prompts to better distinguish between objects, preventing confusion in overlapping cases. Extensive results on three benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of RelationBooth in generating precise relations while preserving object identities across a diverse set of objects and relations. The source code and trained models will be made available to the public.</description>

      <title>In-Context LoRA for Diffusion Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research arXiv:2410.15027 has explored the use of diffusion transformers (DiTs) for task-agnostic image generation by simply concatenating attention tokens across images. However, despite substantial computational resources, the fidelity of the generated images remains suboptimal. In this study, we reevaluate and streamline this framework by hypothesizing that text-to-image DiTs inherently possess in-context generation capabilities, requiring only minimal tuning to activate them. Through diverse task experiments, we qualitatively demonstrate that existing text-to-image DiTs can effectively perform in-context generation without any tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a remarkably simple pipeline to leverage the in-context abilities of DiTs: (1) concatenate images instead of tokens, (2) perform joint captioning of multiple images, and (3) apply task-specific LoRA tuning using small datasets (e.g., 20~100 samples) instead of full-parameter tuning with large datasets. We name our models In-Context LoRA (IC-LoRA). This approach requires no modifications to the original DiT models, only changes to the training data. Remarkably, our pipeline generates high-fidelity image sets that better adhere to prompts. While task-specific in terms of tuning data, our framework remains task-agnostic in architecture and pipeline, offering a powerful tool for the community and providing valuable insights for further research on product-level task-agnostic generation systems. We release our code, data, and models at https://github.com/ali-vilab/In-Context-LoRA</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes the RePAIR dataset that represents a challenging benchmark to test modern computational and data driven methods for puzzle-solving and reassembly tasks. Our dataset has unique properties that are uncommon to current benchmarks for 2D and 3D puzzle solving. The fragments and fractures are realistic, caused by a collapse of a fresco during a World War II bombing at the Pompeii archaeological park. The fragments are also eroded and have missing pieces with irregular shapes and different dimensions, challenging further the reassembly algorithms. The dataset is multi-modal providing high resolution images with characteristic pictorial elements, detailed 3D scans of the fragments and meta-data annotated by the archaeologists. Ground truth has been generated through several years of unceasing fieldwork, including the excavation and cleaning of each fragment, followed by manual puzzle solving by archaeologists of a subset of approx. 1000 pieces among the 16000 available. After digitizing all the fragments in 3D, a benchmark was prepared to challenge current reassembly and puzzle-solving methods that often solve more simplistic synthetic scenarios. The tested baselines show that there clearly exists a gap to fill in solving this computationally complex problem.</description>

      <title>Exploring PCA-based feature representations of image pixels via CNN to enhance food image segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For open vocabulary recognition of ingredients in food images, segmenting the ingredients is a crucial step. This paper proposes a novel approach that explores PCA-based feature representations of image pixels using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance segmentation. An internal clustering metric based on the silhouette score is defined to evaluate the clustering quality of various pixel-level feature representations generated by different feature maps derived from various CNN backbones. Using this metric, the paper explores optimal feature representation selection and suitable clustering methods for ingredient segmentation. Additionally, it is found that principal component (PC) maps derived from concatenations of backbone feature maps improve the clustering quality of pixel-level feature representations, resulting in stable segmentation outcomes. Notably, the number of selected eigenvalues can be used as the number of clusters to achieve good segmentation results. The proposed method performs well on the ingredient-labeled dataset FoodSeg103, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score of 0.5423. Importantly, the proposed method is unsupervised, and pixel-level feature representations from backbones are not fine-tuned on specific datasets. This demonstrates the flexibility, generalizability, and interpretability of the proposed method, while reducing the need for extensive labeled datasets.</description>

      <title>Not Just Object, But State: Compositional Incremental Learning without Forgetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most incremental learners excessively prioritize coarse classes of objects while neglecting various kinds of states (e.g. color and material) attached to the objects. As a result, they are limited in the ability to reason fine-grained compositionality of state-object pairs. To remedy this limitation, we propose a novel task called Compositional Incremental Learning (composition-IL), enabling the model to recognize state-object compositions as a whole in an incremental learning fashion. Since the lack of suitable benchmarks, we re-organize two existing datasets and make them tailored for composition-IL. Then, we propose a prompt-based Composition Incremental Learner (CompILer), to overcome the ambiguous composition boundary problem which challenges composition-IL largely. Specifically, we exploit multi-pool prompt learning, which is regularized by inter-pool prompt discrepancy and intra-pool prompt diversity. Besides, we devise object-injected state prompting by using object prompts to guide the selection of state prompts. Furthermore, we fuse the selected prompts by a generalized-mean strategy, to eliminate irrelevant information learned in the prompts. Extensive experiments on two datasets exhibit state-of-the-art performance achieved by CompILer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, transformer-based techniques incorporating superpoints have become prevalent in 3D instance segmentation. However, they often encounter an over-segmentation problem, especially noticeable with large objects. Additionally, unreliable mask predictions stemming from superpoint mask prediction further compound this issue. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called MSTA3D. It leverages multi-scale feature representation and introduces a twin-attention mechanism to effectively capture them. Furthermore, MSTA3D integrates a box query with a box regularizer, offering a complementary spatial constraint alongside semantic queries. Experimental evaluations on ScanNetV2, ScanNet200 and S3DIS datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art 3D instance segmentation methods.</description>

Abstract: Learning a self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) model with great generalization remains significantly challenging. Despite the success of adversarial augmentation in the supervised learning generalization, naively incorporating it into self-supervised MDE models potentially causes over-regularization, suffering from severe performance degradation. In this paper, we conduct qualitative analysis and illuminate the main causes: (i) inherent sensitivity in the UNet-alike depth network and (ii) dual optimization conflict caused by over-regularization. To tackle these issues, we propose a general adversarial training framework, named Stabilized Conflict-optimization Adversarial Training (SCAT), integrating adversarial data augmentation into self-supervised MDE methods to achieve a balance between stability and generalization. Specifically, we devise an effective scaling depth network that tunes the coefficients of long skip connection and effectively stabilizes the training process. Then, we propose a conflict gradient surgery strategy, which progressively integrates the adversarial gradient and optimizes the model toward a conflict-free direction. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that SCAT can achieve state-of-the-art performance and significantly improve the generalization capability of existing self-supervised MDE methods.</description>

      <title>Digi2Real: Bridging the Realism Gap in Synthetic Data Face Recognition via Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accuracy of face recognition systems has improved significantly in the past few years, thanks to the large amount of data collected and the advancement in neural network architectures. However, these large-scale datasets are often collected without explicit consent, raising ethical and privacy concerns. To address this, there have been proposals to use synthetic datasets for training face recognition models. Yet, such models still rely on real data to train the generative models and generally exhibit inferior performance compared to those trained on real datasets. One of these datasets, DigiFace, uses a graphics pipeline to generate different identities and different intra-class variations without using real data in training the models. However, the performance of this approach is poor on face recognition benchmarks, possibly due to the lack of realism in the images generated from the graphics pipeline. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for realism transfer aimed at enhancing the realism of synthetically generated face images. Our method leverages the large-scale face foundation model, and we adapt the pipeline for realism enhancement. By integrating the controllable aspects of the graphics pipeline with our realism enhancement technique, we generate a large amount of realistic variations-combining the advantages of both approaches. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that models trained using our enhanced dataset significantly improve the performance of face recognition systems over the baseline. The source code and datasets will be made available publicly.</description>

      <title>Tencent Hunyuan3D-1.0: A Unified Framework for Text-to-3D and Image-to-3D Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While 3D generative models have greatly improved artists' workflows, the existing diffusion models for 3D generation suffer from slow generation and poor generalization. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage approach named Hunyuan3D-1.0 including a lite version and a standard version, that both support text- and image-conditioned generation. In the first stage, we employ a multi-view diffusion model that efficiently generates multi-view RGB in approximately 4 seconds. These multi-view images capture rich details of the 3D asset from different viewpoints, relaxing the tasks from single-view to multi-view reconstruction. In the second stage, we introduce a feed-forward reconstruction model that rapidly and faithfully reconstructs the 3D asset given the generated multi-view images in approximately 7 seconds. The reconstruction network learns to handle noises and in-consistency introduced by the multi-view diffusion and leverages the available information from the condition image to efficiently recover the 3D structure. Our framework involves the text-to-image model, i.e., Hunyuan-DiT, making it a unified framework to support both text- and image-conditioned 3D generation. Our standard version has 3x more parameters than our lite and other existing model. Our Hunyuan3D-1.0 achieves an impressive balance between speed and quality, significantly reducing generation time while maintaining the quality and diversity of the produced assets.</description>

      <title>GenXD: Generating Any 3D and 4D Scenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in 2D visual generation have been remarkably successful. However, 3D and 4D generation remain challenging in real-world applications due to the lack of large-scale 4D data and effective model design. In this paper, we propose to jointly investigate general 3D and 4D generation by leveraging camera and object movements commonly observed in daily life. Due to the lack of real-world 4D data in the community, we first propose a data curation pipeline to obtain camera poses and object motion strength from videos. Based on this pipeline, we introduce a large-scale real-world 4D scene dataset: CamVid-30K. By leveraging all the 3D and 4D data, we develop our framework, GenXD, which allows us to produce any 3D or 4D scene. We propose multiview-temporal modules, which disentangle camera and object movements, to seamlessly learn from both 3D and 4D data. Additionally, GenXD employs masked latent conditions to support a variety of conditioning views. GenXD can generate videos that follow the camera trajectory as well as consistent 3D views that can be lifted into 3D representations. We perform extensive evaluations across various real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating GenXD's effectiveness and versatility compared to previous methods in 3D and 4D generation.</description>

      <title>PPLLaVA: Varied Video Sequence Understanding With Prompt Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The past year has witnessed the significant advancement of video-based large language models. However, the challenge of developing a unified model for both short and long video understanding remains unresolved. Most existing video LLMs cannot handle hour-long videos, while methods custom for long videos tend to be ineffective for shorter videos and images. In this paper, we identify the key issue as the redundant content in videos. To address this, we propose a novel pooling strategy that simultaneously achieves token compression and instruction-aware visual feature aggregation. Our model is termed Prompt-guided Pooling LLaVA, or PPLLaVA for short. Specifically, PPLLaVA consists of three core components: the CLIP-based visual-prompt alignment that extracts visual information relevant to the user's instructions, the prompt-guided pooling that compresses the visual sequence to arbitrary scales using convolution-style pooling, and the clip context extension designed for lengthy prompt common in visual dialogue. Moreover, our codebase also integrates the most advanced video Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and visual interleave training. Extensive experiments have validated the performance of our model. With superior throughput and only 1024 visual context, PPLLaVA achieves better results on image benchmarks as a video LLM, while achieving state-of-the-art performance across various video benchmarks, excelling in tasks ranging from caption generation to multiple-choice questions, and handling video lengths from seconds to hours. Codes have been available at https://github.com/farewellthree/PPLLaVA.</description>

      <title>Provably Learning Diverse Features in Multi-View Data with Midpoint Mixup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13512v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixup is a data augmentation technique that relies on training using random convex combinations of data points and their labels. In recent years, Mixup has become a standard primitive used in the training of state-of-the-art image classification models due to its demonstrated benefits over empirical risk minimization with regards to generalization and robustness. In this work, we try to explain some of this success from a feature learning perspective. We focus our attention on classification problems in which each class may have multiple associated features (or views) that can be used to predict the class correctly. Our main theoretical results demonstrate that, for a non-trivial class of data distributions with two features per class, training a 2-layer convolutional network using empirical risk minimization can lead to learning only one feature for almost all classes while training with a specific instantiation of Mixup succeeds in learning both features for every class. We also show empirically that these theoretical insights extend to the practical settings of image benchmarks modified to have multiple features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments and research in modern machine learning have led to substantial improvements in the geospatial field. Although numerous deep learning architectures and models have been proposed, the majority of them have been solely developed on benchmark datasets that lack strong real-world relevance. Furthermore, the performance of many methods has already saturated on these datasets. We argue that a shift from a model-centric view to a complementary data-centric perspective is necessary for further improvements in accuracy, generalization ability, and real impact on end-user applications. Furthermore, considering the entire machine learning cycle-from problem definition to model deployment with feedback-is crucial for enhancing machine learning models that can be reliable in unforeseen situations. This work presents a definition as well as a precise categorization and overview of automated data-centric learning approaches for geospatial data. It highlights the complementary role of data-centric learning with respect to model-centric in the larger machine learning deployment cycle. We review papers across the entire geospatial field and categorize them into different groups. A set of representative experiments shows concrete implementation examples. These examples provide concrete steps to act on geospatial data with data-centric machine learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Identity Curvature Laplace Approximation for Improved Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is crucial in safety-critical applications, where robust out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential. Traditional Bayesian methods, though effective, are often hindered by high computational demands. As an alternative, Laplace approximation offers a more practical and efficient approach to uncertainty estimation. In this paper, we introduce the Identity Curvature Laplace Approximation (ICLA), a novel method that challenges the conventional posterior covariance formulation by using identity curvature and optimizing prior precision. This innovative design significantly enhances OOD detection performance on well-known datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, while maintaining calibration scores. We attribute this improvement to the alignment issues between typical feature embeddings and curvature as measured by the Fisher information matrix. Our findings are further supported by demonstrating that incorporating Fisher penalty or sharpness-aware minimization techniques can greatly enhance the uncertainty estimation capabilities of standard Laplace approximation.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Preference Alignment Remedies Degradation of Visual Instruction Tuning on Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to support multi-turn queries of interchanging image and text modalities in production. However, the current MLLMs trained with visual-question-answering (VQA) datasets could suffer from degradation, as VQA datasets lack the diversity and complexity of the original text instruction datasets with which the underlying language model was trained. To address this degradation, we first collect a lightweight, 5k-sample VQA preference dataset where answers were annotated by Gemini for five quality metrics in a granular fashion and investigate standard Supervised Fine-tuning, rejection sampling, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and SteerLM algorithms. Our findings indicate that with DPO, we can surpass the instruction-following capabilities of the language model, achieving a 6.73 score on MT-Bench, compared to Vicuna's 6.57 and LLaVA's 5.99. This enhancement in textual instruction-following capability correlates with boosted visual instruction performance (+4.9\% on MM-Vet, +6\% on LLaVA-Bench), with minimal alignment tax on visual knowledge benchmarks compared to the previous RLHF approach. In conclusion, we propose a distillation-based multi-modal alignment model with fine-grained annotations on a small dataset that restores and boosts MLLM's language capability after visual instruction tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Generative AI, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), offer new possibilities for integrating cognitive planning into robotic systems. In this work, we present a novel framework for solving the object goal navigation problem that generates efficient exploration strategies. Our approach enables a robot to navigate unfamiliar environments by leveraging LLMs and LVLMs to understand the semantic structure of the scene. To address the challenge of representing complex environments without overwhelming the system, we propose a 3D modular scene representation, enriched with semantic descriptions. This representation is dynamically pruned using an LLM-based mechanism, which filters irrelevant information and focuses on task-specific data. By combining these elements, our system generates high-level sub-goals that guide the exploration of the robot toward the target object. We validate our approach in simulated environments, demonstrating its ability to enhance object search efficiency while maintaining scalability in complex settings.</description>

      <title>SeTAR: Out-of-Distribution Detection with Selective Low-Rank Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12629v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the safe deployment of neural networks. Existing CLIP-based approaches perform OOD detection by devising novel scoring functions or sophisticated fine-tuning methods. In this work, we propose SeTAR, a novel, training-free OOD detection method that leverages selective low-rank approximation of weight matrices in vision-language and vision-only models. SeTAR enhances OOD detection via post-hoc modification of the model's weight matrices using a simple greedy search algorithm. Based on SeTAR, we further propose SeTAR+FT, a fine-tuning extension optimizing model performance for OOD detection tasks. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet1K and Pascal-VOC benchmarks show SeTAR's superior performance, reducing the relatively false positive rate by up to 18.95% and 36.80% compared to zero-shot and fine-tuning baselines. Ablation studies further validate SeTAR's effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability across different model backbones. Our work offers a scalable, efficient solution for OOD detection, setting a new state-of-the-art in this area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies two classes of sampling methods for the solution of inverse problems, namely Randomize-Then-Optimize (RTO), which is rooted in sensitivity analysis, and Langevin methods, which are rooted in the Bayesian framework. The two classes of methods correspond to different assumptions and yield samples from different target distributions. We highlight the main conceptual and theoretical differences between the two approaches and compare them from a practical point of view by tackling two classical inverse problems in imaging: deblurring and inpainting. We show that the choice of the sampling method has a significant impact on the quality of the reconstruction and that the RTO method is more robust to the choice of the parameters.</description>

      <title>Diversity-Driven Synthesis: Enhancing Dataset Distillation through Directed Weight Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sharp increase in data-related expenses has motivated research into condensing datasets while retaining the most informative features. Dataset distillation has thus recently come to the fore. This paradigm generates synthetic datasets that are representative enough to replace the original dataset in training a neural network. To avoid redundancy in these synthetic datasets, it is crucial that each element contains unique features and remains diverse from others during the synthesis stage. In this paper, we provide a thorough theoretical and empirical analysis of diversity within synthesized datasets. We argue that enhancing diversity can improve the parallelizable yet isolated synthesizing approach. Specifically, we introduce a novel method that employs dynamic and directed weight adjustment techniques to modulate the synthesis process, thereby maximizing the representativeness and diversity of each synthetic instance. Our method ensures that each batch of synthetic data mirrors the characteristics of a large, varying subset of the original dataset. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, including CIFAR, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting its effectiveness in producing diverse and representative synthetic datasets with minimal computational expense.

Abstract: The salient multimodal capabilities and interactive experience of GPT-4o highlight its critical role in practical applications, yet it lacks a high-performing open-source counterpart. In this paper, we introduce Ocean-omni, the first open-source 7B Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adept at concurrently processing and analyzing modalities of image, video, audio, and text, while delivering an advanced multimodal interactive experience and strong performance. We propose an effective multimodal training schema starting with 7B model and proceeding through two stages of multimodal alignment and multitask fine-tuning across audio, image, video, and text modal. This approach equips the language model with the ability to handle visual and audio data effectively. Demonstrating strong performance across various omni-modal and multimodal benchmarks, we aim for this contribution to serve as a competitive baseline for the open-source community in advancing multimodal understanding and real-time interaction.</description>

      <title>Mini-Omni2: Towards Open-source GPT-4o with Vision, Speech and Duplex Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GPT-4o, an all-encompassing model, represents a milestone in the development of large multi-modal language models. It can understand visual, auditory, and textual modalities, directly output audio, and support flexible duplex interaction. Models from the open-source community often achieve some functionalities of GPT-4o, such as visual understanding and voice chat. Nevertheless, training a unified model that incorporates all modalities is challenging due to the complexities of multi-modal data, intricate model architectures, and training processes. In this paper, we introduce Mini-Omni2, a visual-audio assistant capable of providing real-time, end-to-end voice responses to visoin and audio queries. By integrating pretrained visual and auditory encoders, Mini-Omni2 maintains performance in individual modalities. We propose a three-stage training process to align modalities, allowing the language model to handle multi-modal inputs and outputs after training on a limited dataset. For interaction, we introduce a command-based interruption mechanism, enabling more flexible interaction with users. To the best of our knowledge, Mini-Omni2 is one of the closest reproductions of GPT-4o, which have similar form of functionality, and we hope it can offer valuable insights for subsequent research.</description>

Abstract: Medical image analysis has emerged as an essential element of contemporary healthcare, facilitating physicians in achieving expedited and precise diagnosis. Recent breakthroughs in deep learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, have markedly revolutionized the analysis of medical pictures, improving the accuracy and efficiency of clinical procedures. Deep learning algorithms, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in autonomously learning features from multidimensional medical pictures, including MRI, CT, and X-ray scans, without the necessity for manual feature extraction. These models have been utilized across multiple medical disciplines, including pathology, radiology, ophthalmology, and cardiology, where they aid in illness detection, classification, and segmentation tasks......</description>

      <title>Decoding Diffusion: A Scalable Framework for Unsupervised Analysis of Latent Space Biases and Representations Using Natural Language Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have made diffusion models powerful tools for creating high-quality images. However, their iterative denoising process makes understanding and interpreting their semantic latent spaces more challenging than other generative models, such as GANs. Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by identifying semantically meaningful directions within the latent space. However, they often need manual interpretation or are limited in the number of vectors that can be trained, restricting their scope and utility. This paper proposes a novel framework for unsupervised exploration of diffusion latent spaces. We directly leverage natural language prompts and image captions to map latent directions. This method allows for the automatic understanding of hidden features and supports a broader range of analysis without the need to train specific vectors. Our method provides a more scalable and interpretable understanding of the semantic knowledge encoded within diffusion models, facilitating comprehensive analysis of latent biases and the nuanced representations these models learn. Experimental results show that our framework can uncover hidden patterns and associations in various domains, offering new insights into the interpretability of diffusion model latent spaces.</description>

      <title>Deep Priors for Video Quality Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we designed a completely blind video quality assessment algorithm using the deep video prior. This work mainly explores the utility of deep video prior in estimating the visual quality of the video. In our work, we have used a single distorted video and a reference video pair to learn the deep video prior. At inference time, the learned deep prior is used to restore the original videos from the distorted videos. The ability of learned deep video prior to restore the original video from the distorted video is measured to quantify distortion in the video. Our hypothesis is that the learned deep video prior fails in restoring the highly distorted videos. The restoring ability of deep video prior is proportional to the distortion present in the video. Therefore, we propose to use the distance between the distorted video and the restored video as the perceptual quality of the video. Our algorithm is trained using a single video pair and it does not need any labelled data. We show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing unsupervised video quality assessment algorithms in terms of LCC and SROCC on a synthetically distorted video quality assessment dataset.</description>

      <title>Advantages of Neural Population Coding for Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar variables, e.g., the orientation of a shape in an image, are commonly predicted using a single output neuron in a neural network. In contrast, the mammalian cortex represents variables with a population of neurons. In this population code, each neuron is most active at its preferred value and shows partial activity for other values. Here, we investigate the benefit of using a population code for the output layer of a neural network. We compare population codes against single-neuron outputs and one-hot vectors. First, we show theoretically and in experiments with synthetic data that population codes improve robustness to input noise in networks of stacked linear layers. Second, we demonstrate the benefit of using population codes to encode ambiguous outputs, such as the pose of symmetric objects. Using the T-LESS dataset of feature-less real-world objects, we show that population codes improve the accuracy of predicting 3D object orientation from image input.</description>

      <title>Advancements and limitations of LLMs in replicating human color-word associations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Color-word associations play a fundamental role in human cognition and design applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely available and demonstrated intelligent behaviors in various benchmarks with natural conversation skills. However, their ability to replicate human color-word associations remains understudied. We compared multiple generations of LLMs (from GPT-3 to GPT-4o) against human color-word associations using data collected from over 10,000 Japanese participants, involving 17 colors and words from eight categories in Japanese. Our findings reveal a clear progression in LLM performance across generations, with GPT-4o achieving the highest accuracy in predicting the best voted word for each color and category. However, the highest median performance was approximately 50% even for GPT-4o with visual inputs (chance level is 10%), and the performance levels varied significantly across word categories and colors, indicating a failure to fully replicate human color-word associations. On the other hand, color discrimination ability estimated from our color-word association data showed that LLMs demonstrated high correlation with human color discrimination patterns, similarly to previous studies. Our study highlights both the advancements in LLM capabilities and their persistent limitations, suggesting differences in semantic memory structures between humans and LLMs in representing color-word associations.</description>
