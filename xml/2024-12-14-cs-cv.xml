      <title>A feature refinement module for light-weight semantic segmentation network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low computational complexity and high segmentation accuracy are both essential to the real-world semantic segmentation tasks. However, to speed up the model inference, most existing approaches tend to design light-weight networks with a very limited number of parameters, leading to a considerable degradation in accuracy due to the decrease of the representation ability of the networks. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a novel semantic segmentation method to improve the capacity of obtaining semantic information for the light-weight network. Specifically, a feature refinement module (FRM) is proposed to extract semantics from multi-stage feature maps generated by the backbone and capture non-local contextual information by utilizing a transformer block. On Cityscapes and Bdd100K datasets, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a promising trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, especially for Cityscapes test set where 80.4% mIoU is achieved and only 214.82 GFLOPs are required.</description>

      <title>A Deep Semantic Segmentation Network with Semantic and Contextual Refinements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in multimedia processing, which can be used for analyzing, understanding, editing contents of images and videos, among others. To accelerate the analysis of multimedia data, existing segmentation researches tend to extract semantic information by progressively reducing the spatial resolutions of feature maps. However, this approach introduces a misalignment problem when restoring the resolution of high-level feature maps. In this paper, we design a Semantic Refinement Module (SRM) to address this issue within the segmentation network. Specifically, SRM is designed to learn a transformation offset for each pixel in the upsampled feature maps, guided by high-resolution feature maps and neighboring offsets. By applying these offsets to the upsampled feature maps, SRM enhances the semantic representation of the segmentation network, particularly for pixels around object boundaries. Furthermore, a Contextual Refinement Module (CRM) is presented to capture global context information across both spatial and channel dimensions. To balance dimensions between channel and space, we aggregate the semantic maps from all four stages of the backbone to enrich channel context information. The efficacy of these proposed modules is validated on three widely used datasets-Cityscapes, Bdd100K, and ADE20K-demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, this paper extends these modules to a lightweight segmentation network, achieving an mIoU of 82.5% on the Cityscapes validation set with only 137.9 GFLOPs.</description>

      <title>Coherent3D: Coherent 3D Portrait Video Reconstruction via Triplane Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in single-image 3D portrait reconstruction have enabled telepresence systems to stream 3D portrait videos from a single camera in real-time, democratizing telepresence. However, per-frame 3D reconstruction exhibits temporal inconsistency and forgets the user's appearance. On the other hand, self-reenactment methods can render coherent 3D portraits by driving a 3D avatar built from a single reference image, but fail to faithfully preserve the user's per-frame appearance (e.g., instantaneous facial expression and lighting). As a result, none of these two frameworks is an ideal solution for democratized 3D telepresence. In this work, we address this dilemma and propose a novel solution that maintains both coherent identity and dynamic per-frame appearance to enable the best possible realism. To this end, we propose a new fusion-based method that takes the best of both worlds by fusing a canonical 3D prior from a reference view with dynamic appearance from per-frame input views, producing temporally stable 3D videos with faithful reconstruction of the user's per-frame appearance. Trained only using synthetic data produced by an expression-conditioned 3D GAN, our encoder-based method achieves both state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction and temporal consistency on in-studio and in-the-wild datasets. https://research.nvidia.com/labs/amri/projects/coherent3d</description>

      <title>ChatDyn: Language-Driven Multi-Actor Dynamics Generation in Street Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating realistic and interactive dynamics of traffic participants according to specific instruction is critical for street scene simulation. However, there is currently a lack of a comprehensive method that generates realistic dynamics of different types of participants including vehicles and pedestrians, with different kinds of interactions between them. In this paper, we introduce ChatDyn, the first system capable of generating interactive, controllable and realistic participant dynamics in street scenes based on language instructions. To achieve precise control through complex language, ChatDyn employs a multi-LLM-agent role-playing approach, which utilizes natural language inputs to plan the trajectories and behaviors for different traffic participants. To generate realistic fine-grained dynamics based on the planning, ChatDyn designs two novel executors: the PedExecutor, a unified multi-task executor that generates realistic pedestrian dynamics under different task plannings; and the VehExecutor, a physical transition-based policy that generates physically plausible vehicle dynamics. Extensive experiments show that ChatDyn can generate realistic driving scene dynamics with multiple vehicles and pedestrians, and significantly outperforms previous methods on subtasks. Code and model will be available at https://vfishc.github.io/chatdyn.</description>

      <title>VisionArena: 230K Real World User-VLM Conversations with Preference Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing adoption and capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) comes the need for benchmarks that capture authentic user-VLM interactions. In response, we create VisionArena, a dataset of 230K real-world conversations between users and VLMs. Collected from Chatbot Arena - an open-source platform where users interact with VLMs and submit preference votes - VisionArena spans 73K unique users, 45 VLMs, and 138 languages. Our dataset contains three subsets: VisionArena-Chat, 200k single and multi-turn conversations between a user and a VLM; VisionArena-Battle, 30K conversations comparing two anonymous VLMs with user preference votes; and VisionArena-Bench, an automatic benchmark of 500 diverse user prompts that efficiently approximate the live Chatbot Arena model rankings. Additionally, we highlight the types of question asked by users, the influence of response style on preference, and areas where models often fail. We find open-ended tasks like captioning and humor are highly style-dependent, and current VLMs struggle with spatial reasoning and planning tasks. Lastly, we show finetuning the same base model on VisionArena-Chat outperforms Llava-Instruct-158K, with a 17-point gain on MMMU and a 46-point gain on the WildVision benchmark.

      <title>Euclid: Supercharging Multimodal LLMs with Synthetic High-Fidelity Visual Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress in recent years, yet continue to struggle with low-level visual perception (LLVP) -- particularly the ability to accurately describe the geometric details of an image. This capability is crucial for applications in areas such as robotics, medical image analysis, and manufacturing. In this paper, we first introduce Geoperception, a benchmark designed to evaluate an MLLM's ability to accurately transcribe 2D geometric information from an image. Using this benchmark, we demonstrate the limitations of leading MLLMs, and then conduct a comprehensive empirical study to explore strategies for improving their performance on geometric tasks. Our findings highlight the benefits of certain model architectures, training techniques, and data strategies, including the use of high-fidelity synthetic data and multi-stage training with a data curriculum. Notably, we find that a data curriculum enables models to learn challenging geometry understanding tasks which they fail to learn from scratch. Leveraging these insights, we develop Euclid, a family of models specifically optimized for strong low-level geometric perception. Although purely trained on synthetic multimodal data, Euclid shows strong generalization ability to novel geometry shapes. For instance, Euclid outperforms the best closed-source model, Gemini-1.5-Pro, by up to 58.56% on certain Geoperception benchmark tasks and 10.65% on average across all tasks.</description>

      <title>DocVLM: Make Your VLM an Efficient Reader</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in diverse visual tasks but face challenges in document understanding, which requires fine-grained text processing. While typical visual tasks perform well with low-resolution inputs, reading-intensive applications demand high-resolution, resulting in significant computational overhead. Using OCR-extracted text in VLM prompts partially addresses this issue but underperforms compared to full-resolution counterpart, as it lacks the complete visual context needed for optimal performance. We introduce DocVLM, a method that integrates an OCR-based modality into VLMs to enhance document processing while preserving original weights. Our approach employs an OCR encoder to capture textual content and layout, compressing these into a compact set of learned queries incorporated into the VLM. Comprehensive evaluations across leading VLMs show that DocVLM significantly reduces reliance on high-resolution images for document understanding. In limited-token regimes (448$\times$448), DocVLM with 64 learned queries improves DocVQA results from 56.0% to 86.6% when integrated with InternVL2 and from 84.4% to 91.2% with Qwen2-VL. In LLaVA-OneVision, DocVLM achieves improved results while using 80% less image tokens. The reduced token usage allows processing multiple pages effectively, showing impressive zero-shot results on DUDE and state-of-the-art performance on MP-DocVQA, highlighting DocVLM's potential for applications requiring high-performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Proactive Adversarial Defense: Harnessing Prompt Tuning in Vision-Language Models to Detect Unseen Backdoored Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat by embedding hidden triggers into inputs, causing models to misclassify them into target labels. While extensive research has focused on mitigating these attacks in object recognition models through weight fine-tuning, much less attention has been given to detecting backdoored samples directly. Given the vast datasets used in training, manual inspection for backdoor triggers is impractical, and even state-of-the-art defense mechanisms fail to fully neutralize their impact. To address this gap, we introduce a groundbreaking method to detect unseen backdoored images during both training and inference. Leveraging the transformative success of prompt tuning in Vision Language Models (VLMs), our approach trains learnable text prompts to differentiate clean images from those with hidden backdoor triggers. Experiments demonstrate the exceptional efficacy of this method, achieving an impressive average accuracy of 86% across two renowned datasets for detecting unseen backdoor triggers, establishing a new standard in backdoor defense.</description>

      <title>Beyond Knowledge Silos: Task Fingerprinting for Democratization of Medical Imaging AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of medical imaging AI is currently undergoing rapid transformations, with methodical research increasingly translated into clinical practice. Despite these successes, research suffers from knowledge silos, hindering collaboration and progress: Existing knowledge is scattered across publications and many details remain unpublished, while privacy regulations restrict data sharing. In the spirit of democratizing of AI, we propose a framework for secure knowledge transfer in the field of medical image analysis. The key to our approach is dataset "fingerprints", structured representations of feature distributions, that enable quantification of task similarity. We tested our approach across 71 distinct tasks and 12 medical imaging modalities by transferring neural architectures, pretraining, augmentation policies, and multi-task learning. According to comprehensive analyses, our method outperforms traditional methods for identifying relevant knowledge and facilitates collaborative model training. Our framework fosters the democratization of AI in medical imaging and could become a valuable tool for promoting faster scientific advancement.</description>

      <title>LLaVA-Zip: Adaptive Visual Token Compression with Intrinsic Image Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) utilizing instruction-following data, such as LLaVA, have achieved great progress in the industry. A major limitation in these models is that visual tokens consume a substantial portion of the maximum token limit in large language models (LLMs), leading to increased computational demands and decreased performance when prompts include multiple images or videos. Industry solutions often mitigate this issue by increasing computational power, but this approach is less feasible in academic environments with limited resources. In this study, we propose Dynamic Feature Map Reduction (DFMR) based on LLaVA-1.5 to address the challenge of visual token overload. DFMR dynamically compresses the visual tokens, freeing up token capacity. Our experimental results demonstrate that integrating DFMR into LLaVA-1.5 significantly improves the performance of LLaVA in varied visual token lengths, offering a promising solution for extending LLaVA to handle multi-image and video scenarios in resource-constrained academic environments and it can also be applied in industry settings for data augmentation to help mitigate the scarcity of open-domain image-text pair datasets in the continued pretraining stage.</description>

      <title>ProtoOcc: Accurate, Efficient 3D Occupancy Prediction Using Dual Branch Encoder-Prototype Query Decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ProtoOcc, a novel 3D occupancy prediction model designed to predict the occupancy states and semantic classes of 3D voxels through a deep semantic understanding of scenes. ProtoOcc consists of two main components: the Dual Branch Encoder (DBE) and the Prototype Query Decoder (PQD). The DBE produces a new 3D voxel representation by combining 3D voxel and BEV representations across multiple scales through a dual branch structure. This design enhances both performance and computational efficiency by providing a large receptive field for the BEV representation while maintaining a smaller receptive field for the voxel representation. The PQD introduces Prototype Queries to accelerate the decoding process. Scene-Adaptive Prototypes are derived from the 3D voxel features of input sample, while Scene-Agnostic Prototypes are computed by applying Scene-Adaptive Prototypes to an Exponential Moving Average during the training phase. By using these prototype-based queries for decoding, we can directly predict 3D occupancy in a single step, eliminating the need for iterative Transformer decoding. Additionally, we propose the Robust Prototype Learning, which injects noise into prototype generation process and trains the model to denoise during the training phase. ProtoOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance with 45.02% mIoU on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark. For single-frame method, it reaches 39.56% mIoU with an inference speed of 12.83 FPS on an NVIDIA RTX 3090. Our code can be found at https://github.com/SPA-junghokim/ProtoOcc.</description>

      <title>Generative Modeling with Explicit Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies indicate that the denoising process in deep generative diffusion models implicitly learns and memorizes semantic information from the data distribution. These findings suggest that capturing more complex data distributions requires larger neural networks, leading to a substantial increase in computational demands, which in turn become the primary bottleneck in both training and inference of diffusion models. To this end, we introduce \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{M}odeling with \textbf{E}xplicit \textbf{M}emory (GMem), leveraging an external memory bank in both training and sampling phases of diffusion models. This approach preserves semantic information from data distributions, reducing reliance on neural network capacity for learning and generalizing across diverse datasets. The results are significant: our GMem enhances both training, sampling efficiency, and generation quality. For instance, on ImageNet at $256 \times 256$ resolution, GMem accelerates SiT training by over $46.7\times$, achieving the performance of a SiT model trained for $7M$ steps in fewer than $150K$ steps. Compared to the most efficient existing method, REPA, GMem still offers a $16\times$ speedup, attaining an FID score of 5.75 within $250K$ steps, whereas REPA requires over $4M$ steps. Additionally, our method achieves state-of-the-art generation quality, with an FID score of {3.56} without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet $256\times256$. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/LINs-lab/GMem}.</description>

      <title>DALI: Domain Adaptive LiDAR Object Detection via Distribution-level and Instance-level Pseudo Label Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object detection using LiDAR point clouds relies on a large amount of human-annotated samples when training the underlying detectors' deep neural networks. However, generating 3D bounding box annotation for a large-scale dataset could be costly and time-consuming. Alternatively, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables a given object detector to operate on a novel new data, with unlabeled training dataset, by transferring the knowledge learned from training labeled \textit{source domain} data to the new unlabeled \textit{target domain}. Pseudo label strategies, which involve training the 3D object detector using target-domain predicted bounding boxes from a pre-trained model, are commonly used in UDA. However, these pseudo labels often introduce noise, impacting performance. In this paper, we introduce the Domain Adaptive LIdar (DALI) object detection framework to address noise at both distribution and instance levels. Firstly, a post-training size normalization (PTSN) strategy is developed to mitigate bias in pseudo label size distribution by identifying an unbiased scale after network training. To address instance-level noise between pseudo labels and corresponding point clouds, two pseudo point clouds generation (PPCG) strategies, ray-constrained and constraint-free, are developed to generate pseudo point clouds for each instance, ensuring the consistency between pseudo labels and pseudo points during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the publicly available and popular datasets KITTI, Waymo, and nuScenes. We show that the proposed DALI framework achieves state-of-the-art results and outperforms leading approaches on most of the domain adaptation tasks.

      <title>Labits: Layered Bidirectional Time Surfaces Representation for Event Camera-based Continuous Dense Trajectory Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras provide a compelling alternative to traditional frame-based sensors, capturing dynamic scenes with high temporal resolution and low latency. Moving objects trigger events with precise timestamps along their trajectory, enabling smooth continuous-time estimation. However, few works have attempted to optimize the information loss during event representation construction, imposing a ceiling on this task. Fully exploiting event cameras requires representations that simultaneously preserve fine-grained temporal information, stable and characteristic 2D visual features, and temporally consistent information density, an unmet challenge in existing representations. We introduce Labits: Layered Bidirectional Time Surfaces, a simple yet elegant representation designed to retain all these features. Additionally, we propose a dedicated module for extracting active pixel local optical flow (APLOF), significantly boosting the performance. Our approach achieves an impressive 49% reduction in trajectory end-point error (TEPE) compared to the previous state-of-the-art on the MultiFlow dataset. The code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>ViUniT: Visual Unit Tests for More Robust Visual Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programming based approaches to reasoning tasks have substantially expanded the types of questions models can answer about visual scenes. Yet on benchmark visual reasoning data, when models answer correctly, they produce incorrect programs 33% of the time. These models are often right for the wrong reasons and risk unexpected failures on new data. Unit tests play a foundational role in ensuring code correctness and could be used to repair such failures. We propose Visual Unit Testing (ViUniT), a framework to improve the reliability of visual programs by automatically generating unit tests. In our framework, a unit test is represented as a novel image and answer pair meant to verify the logical correctness of a program produced for a given query. Our method leverages a language model to create unit tests in the form of image descriptions and expected answers and image synthesis to produce corresponding images. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of what constitutes an effective visual unit test suite, exploring unit test generation, sampling strategies, image generation methods, and varying the number of programs and unit tests. Additionally, we introduce four applications of visual unit tests: best program selection, answer refusal, re-prompting, and unsupervised reward formulations for reinforcement learning. Experiments with two models across three datasets in visual question answering and image-text matching demonstrate that ViUniT improves model performance by 11.4%. Notably, it enables 7B open-source models to outperform gpt-4o-mini by an average of 7.7% and reduces the occurrence of programs that are correct for the wrong reasons by 40%.</description>

      <title>Inference-Time Diffusion Model Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion distillation models effectively accelerate reverse sampling by compressing the process into fewer steps. However, these models still exhibit a performance gap compared to their pre-trained diffusion model counterparts, exacerbated by distribution shifts and accumulated errors during multi-step sampling. To address this, we introduce Distillation++, a novel inference-time distillation framework that reduces this gap by incorporating teacher-guided refinement during sampling. Inspired by recent advances in conditional sampling, our approach recasts student model sampling as a proximal optimization problem with a score distillation sampling loss (SDS). To this end, we integrate distillation optimization during reverse sampling, which can be viewed as teacher guidance that drives student sampling trajectory towards the clean manifold using pre-trained diffusion models. Thus, Distillation++ improves the denoising process in real-time without additional source data or fine-tuning. Distillation++ demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art distillation baselines, particularly in early sampling stages, positioning itself as a robust guided sampling process crafted for diffusion distillation models.

      <title>Video Repurposing from User Generated Content: A Large-scale Dataset and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for producing short-form videos for sharing on social media platforms has experienced significant growth in recent times. Despite notable advancements in the fields of video summarization and highlight detection, which can create partially usable short films from raw videos, these approaches are often domain-specific and require an in-depth understanding of real-world video content. To tackle this predicament, we propose Repurpose-10K, an extensive dataset comprising over 10,000 videos with more than 120,000 annotated clips aimed at resolving the video long-to-short task. Recognizing the inherent constraints posed by untrained human annotators, which can result in inaccurate annotations for repurposed videos, we propose a two-stage solution to obtain annotations from real-world user-generated content. Furthermore, we offer a baseline model to address this challenging task by integrating audio, visual, and caption aspects through a cross-modal fusion and alignment framework. We aspire for our work to ignite groundbreaking research in the lesser-explored realms of video repurposing. The code and data will be available at https://github.com/yongliang-wu/Repurpose.</description>

      <title>LV-CadeNet: Long View Feature Convolution-Attention Fusion Encoder-Decoder Network for Clinical MEG Spike Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely acknowledged that the epileptic foci can be pinpointed by source localizing interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) via Magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, manual detection of IEDs, which appear as spikes in MEG data, is extremely labor intensive and requires considerable professional expertise, limiting the broader adoption of MEG technology. Numerous studies have focused on automatic detection of MEG spikes to overcome this challenge, but these efforts often validate their models on synthetic datasets with balanced positive and negative samples. In contrast, clinical MEG data is highly imbalanced, raising doubts on the real-world efficacy of these models. To address this issue, we introduce LV-CadeNet, a Long View feature Convolution-Attention fusion Encoder-Decoder Network, designed for automatic MEG spike detection in real-world clinical scenarios. Beyond addressing the disparity between training data distribution and clinical test data through semi-supervised learning, our approach also mimics human specialists by constructing long view morphological input data. Moreover, we propose an advanced convolution-attention module to extract temporal and spatial features from the input data. LV-CadeNet significantly improves the accuracy of MEG spike detection, boosting it from 42.31\% to 54.88\% on a novel clinical dataset sourced from Sanbo Brain Hospital Capital Medical University. This dataset, characterized by a highly imbalanced distribution of positive and negative samples, accurately represents real-world clinical scenarios.</description>

      <title>GaGA: Towards Interactive Global Geolocation Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global geolocation, which seeks to predict the geographical location of images captured anywhere in the world, is one of the most challenging tasks in the field of computer vision. In this paper, we introduce an innovative interactive global geolocation assistant named GaGA, built upon the flourishing large vision-language models (LVLMs). GaGA uncovers geographical clues within images and combines them with the extensive world knowledge embedded in LVLMs to determine the geolocations while also providing justifications and explanations for the prediction results. We further designed a novel interactive geolocation method that surpasses traditional static inference approaches. It allows users to intervene, correct, or provide clues for the predictions, making the model more flexible and practical. The development of GaGA relies on the newly proposed Multi-modal Global Geolocation (MG-Geo) dataset, a comprehensive collection of 5 million high-quality image-text pairs. GaGA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GWS15k dataset, improving accuracy by 4.57% at the country level and 2.92% at the city level, setting a new benchmark. These advancements represent a significant leap forward in developing highly accurate, interactive geolocation systems with global applicability.</description>

      <title>Reversing the Damage: A QP-Aware Transformer-Diffusion Approach for 8K Video Restoration under Codec Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DiQP; a novel Transformer-Diffusion model for restoring 8K video quality degraded by codec compression. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first to consider restoring the artifacts introduced by various codecs (AV1, HEVC) by Denoising Diffusion without considering additional noise. This approach allows us to model the complex, non-Gaussian nature of compression artifacts, effectively learning to reverse the degradation. Our architecture combines the power of Transformers to capture long-range dependencies with an enhanced windowed mechanism that preserves spatiotemporal context within groups of pixels across frames. To further enhance restoration, the model incorporates auxiliary "Look Ahead" and "Look Around" modules, providing both future and surrounding frame information to aid in reconstructing fine details and enhancing overall visual quality. Extensive experiments on different datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly for high-resolution videos such as 4K and 8K, showcasing its effectiveness in restoring perceptually pleasing videos from highly compressed sources.</description>

      <title>Sensing for Space Safety and Sustainability: A Deep Learning Approach with Vision Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid increase of space assets represented by small satellites in low Earth orbit can enable ubiquitous digital services for everyone. However, due to the dynamic space environment, numerous space objects, complex atmospheric conditions, and unexpected events can easily introduce adverse conditions affecting space safety, operations, and sustainability of the outer space environment. This challenge calls for responsive, effective satellite object detection (SOD) solutions that allow a small satellite to assess and respond to collision risks, with the consideration of constrained resources on a small satellite platform. This paper discusses the SOD tasks and onboard deep learning (DL) approach to the tasks. Two new DL models are proposed, called GELAN-ViT and GELAN-RepViT, which incorporate vision transformer (ViT) into the Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN) architecture and address limitations by separating the convolutional neural network and ViT paths. These models outperform the state-of-the-art YOLOv9-t in terms of mean average precision (mAP) and computational costs. On the SOD dataset, our proposed models can achieve around 95% mAP50 with giga-floating point operations (GFLOPs) reduced by over 5.0. On the VOC 2012 dataset, they can achieve $\geq$ 60.7% mAP50 with GFLOPs reduced by over 5.2.</description>

      <title>A Flexible Plug-and-Play Module for Generating Variable-Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep supervised hashing has become a pivotal technique in large-scale image retrieval, offering significant benefits in terms of storage and search efficiency. However, existing deep supervised hashing models predominantly focus on generating fixed-length hash codes. This approach fails to address the inherent trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness when using hash codes of varying lengths. To determine the optimal hash code length for a specific task, multiple models must be trained for different lengths, leading to increased training time and computational overhead. Furthermore, the current paradigm overlooks the potential relationships between hash codes of different lengths, limiting the overall effectiveness of the models. To address these challenges, we propose the Nested Hash Layer (NHL), a plug-and-play module designed for existing deep supervised hashing models. The NHL framework introduces a novel mechanism to simultaneously generate hash codes of varying lengths in a nested manner. To tackle the optimization conflicts arising from the multiple learning objectives associated with different code lengths, we further propose an adaptive weights strategy that dynamically monitors and adjusts gradients during training. Additionally, recognizing that the structural information in longer hash codes can provide valuable guidance for shorter hash codes, we develop a long-short cascade self-distillation method within the NHL to enhance the overall quality of the generated hash codes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NHL not only accelerates the training process but also achieves superior retrieval performance across various deep hashing models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/hly1998/NHL.</description>

      <title>CAPrompt: Cyclic Prompt Aggregation for Pre-Trained Model Based Class Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, prompt tuning methods for pre-trained models have demonstrated promising performance in Class Incremental Learning (CIL). These methods typically involve learning task-specific prompts and predicting the task ID to select the appropriate prompts for inference. However, inaccurate task ID predictions can cause severe inconsistencies between the prompts used during training and inference, leading to knowledge forgetting and performance degradation. Additionally, existing prompt tuning methods rely solely on the pre-trained model to predict task IDs, without fully leveraging the knowledge embedded in the learned prompt parameters, resulting in inferior prediction performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel Cyclic Prompt Aggregation (CAPrompt) method that eliminates the dependency on task ID prediction by cyclically aggregating the knowledge from different prompts. Specifically, rather than predicting task IDs, we introduce an innovative prompt aggregation strategy during both training and inference to overcome prompt inconsistency by utilizing a weighted sum of different prompts. Thorough theoretical analysis demonstrates that under concave conditions, the aggregated prompt achieves lower error compared to selecting a single task-specific prompt. Consequently, we incorporate a concave constraint and a linear constraint to guide prompt learning, ensuring compliance with the concave condition requirement. Furthermore, to fully exploit the prompts and achieve more accurate prompt weights, we develop a cyclic weight prediction strategy. This strategy begins with equal weights for each task and automatically adjusts them to more appropriate values in a cyclical manner. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our proposed CAPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2%-3%. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/AAAI2025-CAPrompt.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep clustering is a recent deep learning technique which combines deep learning with traditional unsupervised clustering. At the heart of deep clustering is a loss function which penalizes samples for being an outlier from their ground truth cluster centers in the latent space. The probabilistic variant of deep clustering reformulates the loss using KL divergence. Often, the main constraint of deep clustering is the necessity of a closed form loss function to make backpropagation tractable. Inspired by deep clustering and adversarial net, we reformulate deep clustering as an adversarial net over traditional closed form KL divergence. Training deep clustering becomes a task of minimizing the encoder and maximizing the discriminator. At optimality, this method theoretically approaches the JS divergence between the distribution assumption of the encoder and the discriminator. We demonstrated the performance of our proposed method on several well cited datasets such as SVHN, USPS, MNIST and CIFAR10, achieving on-par or better performance with some of the state-of-the-art deep clustering methods.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Contrastive Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a valuable yet challenging approach that enhances a compact student network by learning from a high-performance but cumbersome teacher model. However, previous KD methods for image restoration overlook the state of the student during the distillation, adopting a fixed solution space that limits the capability of KD. Additionally, relying solely on L1-type loss struggles to leverage the distribution information of images. In this work, we propose a novel dynamic contrastive knowledge distillation (DCKD) framework for image restoration. Specifically, we introduce dynamic contrastive regularization to perceive the student's learning state and dynamically adjust the distilled solution space using contrastive learning. Additionally, we also propose a distribution mapping module to extract and align the pixel-level category distribution of the teacher and student models. Note that the proposed DCKD is a structure-agnostic distillation framework, which can adapt to different backbones and can be combined with methods that optimize upper-bound constraints to further enhance model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCKD significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art KD methods across various image restoration tasks and backbones.</description>

      <title>Selective Visual Prompting in Vision Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained Vision Mamba (Vim) models have demonstrated exceptional performance across various computer vision tasks in a computationally efficient manner, attributed to their unique design of selective state space models. To further extend their applicability to diverse downstream vision tasks, Vim models can be adapted using the efficient fine-tuning technique known as visual prompting. However, existing visual prompting methods are predominantly tailored for Vision Transformer (ViT)-based models that leverage global attention, neglecting the distinctive sequential token-wise compression and propagation characteristics of Vim. Specifically, existing prompt tokens prefixed to the sequence are insufficient to effectively activate the input and forget gates across the entire sequence, hindering the extraction and propagation of discriminative information. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel Selective Visual Prompting (SVP) method specifically for the efficient fine-tuning of Vim. To prevent the loss of discriminative information during state space propagation, SVP employs lightweight selective prompters for token-wise prompt generation, ensuring adaptive activation of the update and forget gates within Mamba blocks to promote discriminative information propagation. Moreover, considering that Vim propagates both shared cross-layer information and specific inner-layer information, we further refine SVP with a dual-path structure: Cross-Prompting and Inner-Prompting. Cross-Prompting utilizes shared parameters across layers, while Inner-Prompting employs distinct parameters, promoting the propagation of both shared and specific information, respectively. Extensive experimental results on various large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed SVP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/AAAI2025-SVP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have shown great promise in producing high-quality video content. However, efficiently training diffusion models capable of integrating directional guidance and controllable motion intensity remains a challenging and under-explored area. This paper introduces Mojito, a diffusion model that incorporates both \textbf{Mo}tion tra\textbf{j}ectory and \textbf{i}ntensi\textbf{t}y contr\textbf{o}l for text to video generation. Specifically, Mojito features a Directional Motion Control module that leverages cross-attention to efficiently direct the generated object's motion without additional training, alongside a Motion Intensity Modulator that uses optical flow maps generated from videos to guide varying levels of motion intensity. Extensive experiments demonstrate Mojito's effectiveness in achieving precise trajectory and intensity control with high computational efficiency, generating motion patterns that closely match specified directions and intensities, providing realistic dynamics that align well with natural motion in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Industrial Anomaly Detection by Crossmodal Reverse Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely studied in unsupervised Industrial Image Anomaly Detection (AD), but its application to unsupervised multimodal AD remains underexplored. Existing KD-based methods for multimodal AD that use fused multimodal features to obtain teacher representations face challenges. Anomalies in one modality may not be effectively captured in the fused teacher features, leading to detection failures. Besides, these methods do not fully leverage the rich intra- and inter-modality information. In this paper, we propose Crossmodal Reverse Distillation (CRD) based on Multi-branch design to realize Multimodal Industrial AD. By assigning independent branches to each modality, our method enables finer detection of anomalies within each modality. Furthermore, we enhance the interaction between modalities during the distillation process by designing Crossmodal Filter and Amplifier. With the idea of crossmodal mapping, the student network is allowed to better learn normal features while anomalies in all modalities are ensured to be effectively detected. Experimental verifications on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal anomaly detection and localization.</description>

      <title>AFFAKT: A Hierarchical Optimal Transport based Method for Affective Facial Knowledge Transfer in Video Deception Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality large-scale labeled datasets poses a huge challenge for employing deep learning models in video deception detection. To address this issue, inspired by the psychological theory on the relation between deception and expressions, we propose a novel method called AFFAKT in this paper, which enhances the classification performance by transferring useful and correlated knowledge from a large facial expression dataset. Two key challenges in knowledge transfer arise: 1) \textit{how much} knowledge of facial expression data should be transferred and 2) \textit{how to} effectively leverage transferred knowledge for the deception classification model during inference. Specifically, the optimal relation mapping between facial expression classes and deception samples is firstly quantified using proposed H-OTKT module and then transfers knowledge from the facial expression dataset to deception samples. Moreover, a correlation prototype within another proposed module SRKB is well designed to retain the invariant correlations between facial expression classes and deception classes through momentum updating. During inference, the transferred knowledge is fine-tuned with the correlation prototype using a sample-specific re-weighting strategy. Experimental results on two deception detection datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method. The interpretability study reveals high associations between deception and negative affections, which coincides with the theory in psychology.</description>

      <title>Is Contrastive Distillation Enough for Learning Comprehensive 3D Representations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-modal contrastive distillation has recently been explored for learning effective 3D representations. However, existing methods focus primarily on modality-shared features, neglecting the modality-specific features during the pre-training process, which leads to suboptimal representations. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the limitations of current contrastive methods for 3D representation learning and propose a new framework, namely CMCR, to address these shortcomings. Our approach improves upon traditional methods by better integrating both modality-shared and modality-specific features. Specifically, we introduce masked image modeling and occupancy estimation tasks to guide the network in learning more comprehensive modality-specific features. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal unified codebook that learns an embedding space shared across different modalities. Besides, we introduce geometry-enhanced masked image modeling to further boost 3D representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method mitigates the challenges faced by traditional approaches and consistently outperforms existing image-to-LiDAR contrastive distillation methods in downstream tasks.

      <title>Elevating Flow-Guided Video Inpainting with Reference Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video inpainting (VI) is a challenging task that requires effective propagation of observable content across frames while simultaneously generating new content not present in the original video. In this study, we propose a robust and practical VI framework that leverages a large generative model for reference generation in combination with an advanced pixel propagation algorithm. Powered by a strong generative model, our method not only significantly enhances frame-level quality for object removal but also synthesizes new content in the missing areas based on user-provided text prompts. For pixel propagation, we introduce a one-shot pixel pulling method that effectively avoids error accumulation from repeated sampling while maintaining sub-pixel precision. To evaluate various VI methods in realistic scenarios, we also propose a high-quality VI benchmark, HQVI, comprising carefully generated videos using alpha matte composition. On public benchmarks and the HQVI dataset, our method demonstrates significantly higher visual quality and metric scores compared to existing solutions. Furthermore, it can process high-resolution videos exceeding 2K resolution with ease, underscoring its superiority for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Facial Consistency in Conditional Video Generation via Facial Landmark Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landmark-guided character animation generation is an important field. Generating character animations with facial features consistent with a reference image remains a significant challenge in conditional video generation, especially involving complex motions like dancing. Existing methods often fail to maintain facial feature consistency due to mismatches between the facial landmarks extracted from source videos and the target facial features in the reference image. To address this problem, we propose a facial landmark transformation method based on the 3D Morphable Model (3DMM). We obtain transformed landmarks that align with the target facial features by reconstructing 3D faces from the source landmarks and adjusting the 3DMM parameters to match the reference image. Our method improves the facial consistency between the generated videos and the reference images, effectively improving the facial feature mismatch problem.</description>

      <title>MS2Mesh-XR: Multi-modal Sketch-to-Mesh Generation in XR Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MS2Mesh-XR, a novel multi-modal sketch-to-mesh generation pipeline that enables users to create realistic 3D objects in extended reality (XR) environments using hand-drawn sketches assisted by voice inputs. In specific, users can intuitively sketch objects using natural hand movements in mid-air within a virtual environment. By integrating voice inputs, we devise ControlNet to infer realistic images based on the drawn sketches and interpreted text prompts. Users can then review and select their preferred image, which is subsequently reconstructed into a detailed 3D mesh using the Convolutional Reconstruction Model. In particular, our proposed pipeline can generate a high-quality 3D mesh in less than 20 seconds, allowing for immersive visualization and manipulation in run-time XR scenes. We demonstrate the practicability of our pipeline through two use cases in XR settings. By leveraging natural user inputs and cutting-edge generative AI capabilities, our approach can significantly facilitate XR-based creative production and enhance user experiences.

      <title>Arbitrary-steps Image Super-resolution via Diffusion Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a new image super-resolution (SR) technique based on diffusion inversion, aiming at harnessing the rich image priors encapsulated in large pre-trained diffusion models to improve SR performance. We design a Partial noise Prediction strategy to construct an intermediate state of the diffusion model, which serves as the starting sampling point. Central to our approach is a deep noise predictor to estimate the optimal noise maps for the forward diffusion process. Once trained, this noise predictor can be used to initialize the sampling process partially along the diffusion trajectory, generating the desirable high-resolution result. Compared to existing approaches, our method offers a flexible and efficient sampling mechanism that supports an arbitrary number of sampling steps, ranging from one to five. Even with a single sampling step, our method demonstrates superior or comparable performance to recent state-of-the-art approaches. The code and model are publicly available at https://github.com/zsyOAOA/InvSR.</description>

      <title>STEAM: Squeeze and Transform Enhanced Attention Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel and spatial attention mechanisms introduced by earlier works enhance the representation abilities of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) but often lead to increased parameter and computation costs. While recent approaches focus solely on efficient feature context modeling for channel attention, we aim to model both channel and spatial attention comprehensively with minimal parameters and reduced computation. Leveraging the principles of relational modeling in graphs, we introduce a constant-parameter module, STEAM: Squeeze and Transform Enhanced Attention Module, which integrates channel and spatial attention to enhance the representation power of CNNs. To our knowledge, we are the first to propose a graph-based approach for modeling both channel and spatial attention, utilizing concepts from multi-head graph transformers. Additionally, we introduce Output Guided Pooling (OGP), which efficiently captures spatial context to further enhance spatial attention. We extensively evaluate STEAM for large-scale image classification, object detection and instance segmentation on standard benchmark datasets. STEAM achieves a 2% increase in accuracy over the standard ResNet-50 model with only a meager increase in GFLOPs. Furthermore, STEAM outperforms leading modules ECA and GCT in terms of accuracy while achieving a three-fold reduction in GFLOPs.</description>

      <title>Video Anomaly Detection with Motion and Appearance Guided Patch Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent endeavor in one class of video anomaly detection is to leverage diffusion models and posit the task as a generation problem, where the diffusion model is trained to recover normal patterns exclusively, thus reporting abnormal patterns as outliers. Yet, existing attempts neglect the various formations of anomaly and predict normal samples at the feature level regardless that abnormal objects in surveillance videos are often relatively small. To address this, a novel patch-based diffusion model is proposed, specifically engineered to capture fine-grained local information. We further observe that anomalies in videos manifest themselves as deviations in both appearance and motion. Therefore, we argue that a comprehensive solution must consider both of these aspects simultaneously to achieve accurate frame prediction. To address this, we introduce innovative motion and appearance conditions that are seamlessly integrated into our patch diffusion model. These conditions are designed to guide the model in generating coherent and contextually appropriate predictions for both semantic content and motion relations. Experimental results in four challenging video anomaly detection datasets empirically substantiate the efficacy of our proposed approach, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms most existing methods in detecting abnormal behaviors.</description>

      <title>DrivingRecon: Large 4D Gaussian Reconstruction Model For Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photorealistic 4D reconstruction of street scenes is essential for developing real-world simulators in autonomous driving. However, most existing methods perform this task offline and rely on time-consuming iterative processes, limiting their practical applications. To this end, we introduce the Large 4D Gaussian Reconstruction Model (DrivingRecon), a generalizable driving scene reconstruction model, which directly predicts 4D Gaussian from surround view videos. To better integrate the surround-view images, the Prune and Dilate Block (PD-Block) is proposed to eliminate overlapping Gaussian points between adjacent views and remove redundant background points. To enhance cross-temporal information, dynamic and static decoupling is tailored to better learn geometry and motion features. Experimental results demonstrate that DrivingRecon significantly improves scene reconstruction quality and novel view synthesis compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we explore applications of DrivingRecon in model pre-training, vehicle adaptation, and scene editing. Our code is available at https://github.com/EnVision-Research/DriveRecon.</description>

      <title>Motif Guided Graph Transformer with Combinatorial Skeleton Prototype Learning for Skeleton-Based Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Person re-identification (re-ID) via 3D skeleton data is a challenging task with significant value in many scenarios. Existing skeleton-based methods typically assume virtual motion relations between all joints, and adopt average joint or sequence representations for learning. However, they rarely explore key body structure and motion such as gait to focus on more important body joints or limbs, while lacking the ability to fully mine valuable spatial-temporal sub-patterns of skeletons to enhance model learning. This paper presents a generic Motif guided graph transformer with Combinatorial skeleton prototype learning (MoCos) that exploits structure-specific and gait-related body relations as well as combinatorial features of skeleton graphs to learn effective skeleton representations for person re-ID. In particular, motivated by the locality within joints' structure and the body-component collaboration in gait, we first propose the motif guided graph transformer (MGT) that incorporates hierarchical structural motifs and gait collaborative motifs, which simultaneously focuses on multi-order local joint correlations and key cooperative body parts to enhance skeleton relation learning. Then, we devise the combinatorial skeleton prototype learning (CSP) that leverages random spatial-temporal combinations of joint nodes and skeleton graphs to generate diverse sub-skeleton and sub-tracklet representations, which are contrasted with the most representative features (prototypes) of each identity to learn class-related semantics and discriminative skeleton representations. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of MoCos over existing state-of-the-art models. We further show its generality under RGB-estimated skeletons, different graph modeling, and unsupervised scenarios.</description>

      <title>ContextHOI: Spatial Context Learning for Human-Object Interaction Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial contexts, such as the backgrounds and surroundings, are considered critical in Human-Object Interaction (HOI) recognition, especially when the instance-centric foreground is blurred or occluded. Recent advancements in HOI detectors are usually built upon detection transformer pipelines. While such an object-detection-oriented paradigm shows promise in localizing objects, its exploration of spatial context is often insufficient for accurately recognizing human actions. To enhance the capabilities of object detectors for HOI detection, we present a dual-branch framework named ContextHOI, which efficiently captures both object detection features and spatial contexts. In the context branch, we train the model to extract informative spatial context without requiring additional hand-craft background labels. Furthermore, we introduce context-aware spatial and semantic supervision to the context branch to filter out irrelevant noise and capture informative contexts. ContextHOI achieves state-of-the-art performance on the HICO-DET and v-coco benchmarks. For further validation, we construct a novel benchmark, HICO-ambiguous, which is a subset of HICO-DET that contains images with occluded or impaired instance cues. Extensive experiments across all benchmarks, complemented by visualizations, underscore the enhancements provided by ContextHOI, especially in recognizing interactions involving occluded or blurred instances.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic-constraint Point Cloud Reconstruction from Single RGB-D Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing desired objects and scenes has long been a primary goal in 3D computer vision. Single-view point cloud reconstruction has become a popular technique due to its low cost and accurate results. However, single-view reconstruction methods often rely on expensive CAD models and complex geometric priors. Effectively utilizing prior knowledge about the data remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce hyperbolic space to 3D point cloud reconstruction, enabling the model to represent and understand complex hierarchical structures in point clouds with low distortion. We build upon previous methods by proposing a hyperbolic Chamfer distance and a regularized triplet loss to enhance the relationship between partial and complete point clouds. Additionally, we design adaptive boundary conditions to improve the model's understanding and reconstruction of 3D structures. Our model outperforms most existing models, and ablation studies demonstrate the significance of our model and its components. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves feature extraction capabilities. Our model achieves outstanding performance in 3D reconstruction tasks.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Framework for Enhancing Discriminative Models via Diffusion Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image classification serves as the cornerstone of computer vision, traditionally achieved through discriminative models based on deep neural networks. Recent advancements have introduced classification methods derived from generative models, which offer the advantage of zero-shot classification. However, these methods suffer from two main drawbacks: high computational overhead and inferior performance compared to discriminative models. Inspired by the coordinated cognitive processes of rapid-slow pathway interactions in the human brain during visual signal recognition, we propose the Diffusion-Based Discriminative Model Enhancement Framework (DBMEF). This framework seamlessly integrates discriminative and generative models in a training-free manner, leveraging discriminative models for initial predictions and endowing deep neural networks with rethinking capabilities via diffusion models. Consequently, DBMEF can effectively enhance the classification accuracy and generalization capability of discriminative models in a plug-and-play manner. We have conducted extensive experiments across 17 prevalent deep model architectures with different training methods, including both CNN-based models such as ResNet and Transformer-based models like ViT, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DBMEF. Specifically, the framework yields a 1.51\% performance improvement for ResNet-50 on the ImageNet dataset and 3.02\% on the ImageNet-A dataset. In conclusion, our research introduces a novel paradigm for image classification, demonstrating stable improvements across different datasets and neural networks.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we explore new perspectives on cross-view completion learning by drawing an analogy to self-supervised correspondence learning. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that the cross-attention map within cross-view completion models captures correspondence more effectively than other correlations derived from encoder or decoder features. We verify the effectiveness of the cross-attention map by evaluating on both zero-shot matching and learning-based geometric matching and multi-frame depth estimation.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL) aims to transfer knowledge from seen source domains to unseen target domains, which is crucial for evaluating the generalization and robustness of models. Recent studies focus on utilizing visual styles to bridge the domain gap between different domains. However, the serious dilemma of gradient instability and local optimization problem occurs in those style-based CD-FSL methods. This paper addresses these issues and proposes a novel crop-global style perturbation method, called \underline{\textbf{S}}elf-\underline{\textbf{V}}ersatility \underline{\textbf{A}}dversarial \underline{\textbf{S}}tyle \underline{\textbf{P}}erturbation (\textbf{SVasP}), which enhances the gradient stability and escapes from poor sharp minima jointly. Specifically, SVasP simulates more diverse potential target domain adversarial styles via diversifying input patterns and aggregating localized crop style gradients, to serve as global style perturbation stabilizers within one image, a concept we refer to as self-versatility. Then a novel objective function is proposed to maximize visual discrepancy while maintaining semantic consistency between global, crop, and adversarial features. Having the stabilized global style perturbation in the training phase, one can obtain a flattened minima in the loss landscape, boosting the transferability of the model to the target domains. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>DomCLP: Domain-wise Contrastive Learning with Prototype Mixup for Unsupervised Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods based on the instance discrimination tasks with InfoNCE have achieved remarkable success. Despite their success, SSL models often struggle to generate effective representations for unseen-domain data. To address this issue, research on unsupervised domain generalization (UDG), which aims to develop SSL models that can generate domain-irrelevant features, has been conducted. Most UDG approaches utilize contrastive learning with InfoNCE to generate representations, and perform feature alignment based on strong assumptions to generalize domain-irrelevant common features from multi-source domains. However, existing methods that rely on instance discrimination tasks are not effective at extracting domain-irrelevant common features. This leads to the suppression of domain-irrelevant common features and the amplification of domain-relevant features, thereby hindering domain generalization. Furthermore, strong assumptions underlying feature alignment can lead to biased feature learning, reducing the diversity of common features. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, DomCLP, Domain-wise Contrastive Learning with Prototype Mixup. We explore how InfoNCE suppresses domain-irrelevant common features and amplifies domain-relevant features. Based on this analysis, we propose Domain-wise Contrastive Learning (DCon) to enhance domain-irrelevant common features. We also propose Prototype Mixup Learning (PMix) to generalize domain-irrelevant common features across multiple domains without relying on strong assumptions. The proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the PACS and DomainNet datasets across various label fractions, showing significant improvements. Our code will be released.

      <title>Towards Long-Horizon Vision-Language Navigation: Platform, Benchmark and Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) methods primarily focus on single-stage navigation, limiting their effectiveness in multi-stage and long-horizon tasks within complex and dynamic environments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VLN task, named Long-Horizon Vision-Language Navigation (LH-VLN), which emphasizes long-term planning and decision consistency across consecutive subtasks. Furthermore, to support LH-VLN, we develop an automated data generation platform NavGen, which constructs datasets with complex task structures and improves data utility through a bidirectional, multi-granularity generation approach. To accurately evaluate complex tasks, we construct the Long-Horizon Planning and Reasoning in VLN (LHPR-VLN) benchmark consisting of 3,260 tasks with an average of 150 task steps, serving as the first dataset specifically designed for the long-horizon vision-language navigation task. Furthermore, we propose Independent Success Rate (ISR), Conditional Success Rate (CSR), and CSR weight by Ground Truth (CGT) metrics, to provide fine-grained assessments of task completion. To improve model adaptability in complex tasks, we propose a novel Multi-Granularity Dynamic Memory (MGDM) module that integrates short-term memory blurring with long-term memory retrieval to enable flexible navigation in dynamic environments. Our platform, benchmark and method supply LH-VLN with a robust data generation pipeline, comprehensive model evaluation dataset, reasonable metrics, and a novel VLN model, establishing a foundational framework for advancing LH-VLN.</description>

      <title>ResFlow: Fine-tuning Residual Optical Flow for Event-based High Temporal Resolution Motion Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras hold significant promise for high-temporal-resolution (HTR) motion estimation. However, estimating event-based HTR optical flow faces two key challenges: the absence of HTR ground-truth data and the intrinsic sparsity of event data. Most existing approaches rely on the flow accumulation paradigms to indirectly supervise intermediate flows, often resulting in accumulation errors and optimization difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose a residual-based paradigm for estimating HTR optical flow with event data. Our approach separates HTR flow estimation into two stages: global linear motion estimation and HTR residual flow refinement. The residual paradigm effectively mitigates the impacts of event sparsity on optimization and is compatible with any LTR algorithm. Next, to address the challenge posed by the absence of HTR ground truth, we incorporate novel learning strategies. Specifically, we initially employ a shared refiner to estimate the residual flows, enabling both LTR supervision and HTR inference. Subsequently, we introduce regional noise to simulate the residual patterns of intermediate flows, facilitating the adaptation from LTR supervision to HTR inference. Additionally, we show that the noise-based strategy supports in-domain self-supervised training. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in both LTR and HTR metrics, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.</description>

      <title>LVMark: Robust Watermark for latent video diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid advancements in generative models have made it possible to create hyper-realistic videos. As their applicability increases, their unauthorized use has raised significant concerns, leading to the growing demand for techniques to protect the ownership of the generative model itself. While existing watermarking methods effectively embed watermarks into image-generative models, they fail to account for temporal information, resulting in poor performance when applied to video-generative models. To address this issue, we introduce a novel watermarking method called LVMark, which embeds watermarks into video diffusion models. A key component of LVMark is a selective weight modulation strategy that efficiently embeds watermark messages into the video diffusion model while preserving the quality of the generated videos. To accurately decode messages in the presence of malicious attacks, we design a watermark decoder that leverages spatio-temporal information in the 3D wavelet domain through a cross-attention module. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to highlight the potential of video-generative model watermarking as a valuable tool for enhancing the effectiveness of ownership protection in video-generative models.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Adversarial Attacks on Traffic Sign Classifiers beyond Standard Baselines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks on traffic sign classification models were among the first successfully tried in the real world. Since then, the research in this area has been mainly restricted to repeating baseline models, such as LISA-CNN or GTSRB-CNN, and similar experiment settings, including white and black patches on traffic signs. In this work, we decouple model architectures from the datasets and evaluate on further generic models to make a fair comparison. Furthermore, we compare two attack settings, inconspicuous and visible, which are usually regarded without direct comparison. Our results show that standard baselines like LISA-CNN or GTSRB-CNN are significantly more susceptible than the generic ones. We, therefore, suggest evaluating new attacks on a broader spectrum of baselines in the future. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/KASTEL-MobilityLab/attacks-on-traffic-sign-recognition/}.</description>

      <title>Pinpoint Counterfactuals: Reducing social bias in foundation models via localized counterfactual generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models trained on web-scraped datasets propagate societal biases to downstream tasks. While counterfactual generation enables bias analysis, existing methods introduce artifacts by modifying contextual elements like clothing and background. We present a localized counterfactual generation method that preserves image context by constraining counterfactual modifications to specific attribute-relevant regions through automated masking and guided inpainting. When applied to the Conceptual Captions dataset for creating gender counterfactuals, our method results in higher visual and semantic fidelity than state-of-the-art alternatives, while maintaining the performance of models trained using only real data on non-human-centric tasks. Models fine-tuned with our counterfactuals demonstrate measurable bias reduction across multiple metrics, including a decrease in gender classification disparity and balanced person preference scores, while preserving ImageNet zero-shot performance. The results establish a framework for creating balanced datasets that enable both accurate bias profiling and effective mitigation.</description>

      <title>DECOR:Decomposition and Projection of Text Embeddings for Text-to-Image Customization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models can effectively capture the content or style of reference images to perform high-quality customization. A representative technique for this is fine-tuning using low-rank adaptations (LoRA), which enables efficient model customization with reference images. However, fine-tuning with a limited number of reference images often leads to overfitting, resulting in issues such as prompt misalignment or content leakage. These issues prevent the model from accurately following the input prompt or generating undesired objects during inference. To address this problem, we examine the text embeddings that guide the diffusion model during inference. This study decomposes the text embedding matrix and conducts a component analysis to understand the embedding space geometry and identify the cause of overfitting. Based on this, we propose DECOR, which projects text embeddings onto a vector space orthogonal to undesired token vectors, thereby reducing the influence of unwanted semantics in the text embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate that DECOR outperforms state-of-the-art customization models and achieves Pareto frontier performance across text and visual alignment evaluation metrics. Furthermore, it generates images more faithful to the input prompts, showcasing its effectiveness in addressing overfitting and enhancing text-to-image customization.</description>

      <title>Weighted Poisson-disk Resampling on Large-Scale Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For large-scale point cloud processing, resampling takes the important role of controlling the point number and density while keeping the geometric consistency. % in related tasks. However, current methods cannot balance such different requirements. Particularly with large-scale point clouds, classical methods often struggle with decreased efficiency and accuracy. To address such issues, we propose a weighted Poisson-disk (WPD) resampling method to improve the usability and efficiency for the processing. We first design an initial Poisson resampling with a voxel-based estimation strategy. It is able to estimate a more accurate radius of the Poisson-disk while maintaining high efficiency. Then, we design a weighted tangent smoothing step to further optimize the Voronoi diagram for each point. At the same time, sharp features are detected and kept in the optimized results with isotropic property. Finally, we achieve a resampling copy from the original point cloud with the specified point number, uniform density, and high-quality geometric consistency. Experiments show that our method significantly improves the performance of large-scale point cloud resampling for different applications, and provides a highly practical solution.</description>

      <title>On the effectiveness of Rotation-Equivariance in U-Net: A Benchmark for Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous studies have recently focused on incorporating different variations of equivariance in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In particular, rotation-equivariance has gathered significant attention due to its relevance in many applications related to medical imaging, microscopic imaging, satellite imaging, industrial tasks, etc. While prior research has primarily focused on enhancing classification tasks with rotation equivariant CNNs, their impact on more complex architectures, such as U-Net for image segmentation, remains scarcely explored. Indeed, previous work interested in integrating rotation-equivariance into U-Net architecture have focused on solving specific applications with a limited scope. In contrast, this paper aims to provide a more exhaustive evaluation of rotation equivariant U-Net for image segmentation across a broader range of tasks. We benchmark their effectiveness against standard U-Net architectures, assessing improvements in terms of performance and sustainability (i.e., computational cost). Our evaluation focuses on datasets whose orientation of objects of interest is arbitrary in the image (e.g., Kvasir-SEG), but also on more standard segmentation datasets (such as COCO-Stuff) as to explore the wider applicability of rotation equivariance beyond tasks undoubtedly concerned by rotation equivariance. The main contribution of this work is to provide insights into the trade-offs and advantages of integrating rotation equivariance for segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>RAD: Region-Aware Diffusion Models for Image Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, with applications broadening across various domains. Inpainting is one such application that can benefit significantly from diffusion models. Existing methods either hijack the reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model or cast the problem into a larger framework, \ie, conditioned generation. However, these approaches often require nested loops in the generation process or additional components for conditioning. In this paper, we present region-aware diffusion models (RAD) for inpainting with a simple yet effective reformulation of the vanilla diffusion models. RAD utilizes a different noise schedule for each pixel, which allows local regions to be generated asynchronously while considering the global image context. A plain reverse process requires no additional components, enabling RAD to achieve inference time up to 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we employ low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune RAD based on other pretrained diffusion models, reducing computational burdens in training as well. Experiments demonstrated that RAD provides state-of-the-art results both qualitatively and quantitatively, on the FFHQ, LSUN Bedroom, and ImageNet datasets.</description>

      <title>ExpRDiff: Short-exposure Guided Diffusion Model for Realistic Local Motion Deblurring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Removing blur caused by moving objects is challenging, as the moving objects are usually significantly blurry while the static background remains clear. Existing methods that rely on local blur detection often suffer from inaccuracies and cannot generate satisfactory results when focusing solely on blurred regions. To overcome these problems, we first design a context-based local blur detection module that incorporates additional contextual information to improve the identification of blurry regions. Considering that modern smartphones are equipped with cameras capable of providing short-exposure images, we develop a blur-aware guided image restoration method that utilizes sharp structural details from short-exposure images, facilitating accurate reconstruction of heavily blurred regions. Furthermore, to restore images realistically and visually-pleasant, we develop a short-exposure guided diffusion model that explores useful features from short-exposure images and blurred regions to better constrain the diffusion process. Finally, we formulate the above components into a simple yet effective network, named ExpRDiff. Experimental results show that ExpRDiff performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>MVC-VPR: Mutual Learning of Viewpoint Classification and Visual Place Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to robustly identify locations by leveraging image retrieval based on descriptors encoded from environmental images. However, drastic appearance changes of images captured from different viewpoints at the same location pose incoherent supervision signals for descriptor learning, which severely hinder the performance of VPR. Previous work proposes classifying images based on manually defined rules or ground truth labels for viewpoints, followed by descriptor training based on the classification results. However, not all datasets have ground truth labels of viewpoints and manually defined rules may be suboptimal, leading to degraded descriptor performance.To address these challenges, we introduce the mutual learning of viewpoint self-classification and VPR. Starting from coarse classification based on geographical coordinates, we progress to finer classification of viewpoints using simple clustering techniques. The dataset is partitioned in an unsupervised manner while simultaneously training a descriptor extractor for place recognition. Experimental results show that this approach almost perfectly partitions the dataset based on viewpoints, thus achieving mutually reinforcing effects. Our method even excels state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that partition datasets using ground truth labels.</description>

      <title>Temporal Action Localization with Cross Layer Task Decoupling and Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal action localization (TAL) involves dual tasks to classify and localize actions within untrimmed videos. However, the two tasks often have conflicting requirements for features. Existing methods typically employ separate heads for classification and localization tasks but share the same input feature, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel TAL method with Cross Layer Task Decoupling and Refinement (CLTDR). Based on the feature pyramid of video, CLTDR strategy integrates semantically strong features from higher pyramid layers and detailed boundary-aware boundary features from lower pyramid layers to effectively disentangle the action classification and localization tasks. Moreover, the multiple features from cross layers are also employed to refine and align the disentangled classification and regression results. At last, a lightweight Gated Multi-Granularity (GMG) module is proposed to comprehensively extract and aggregate video features at instant, local, and global temporal granularities. Benefiting from the CLTDR and GMG modules, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five challenging benchmarks: THUMOS14, MultiTHUMOS, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/LiQiang0307/CLTDR-GMG.</description>

      <title>eCARLA-scenes: A synthetically generated dataset for event-based optical flow prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The joint use of event-based vision and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) is expected to have a large impact in robotics in the near future, in tasks such as, visual odometry and obstacle avoidance. While researchers have used real-world event datasets for optical flow prediction (mostly captured with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)), these datasets are limited in diversity, scalability, and are challenging to collect. Thus, synthetic datasets offer a scalable alternative by bridging the gap between reality and simulation. In this work, we address the lack of datasets by introducing eWiz, a comprehensive library for processing event-based data. It includes tools for data loading, augmentation, visualization, encoding, and generation of training data, along with loss functions and performance metrics. We further present a synthetic event-based datasets and data generation pipelines for optical flow prediction tasks. Built on top of eWiz, eCARLA-scenes makes use of the CARLA simulator to simulate self-driving car scenarios. The ultimate goal of this dataset is the depiction of diverse environments while laying a foundation for advancing event-based camera applications in autonomous field vehicle navigation, paving the way for using SNNs on neuromorphic hardware such as the Intel Loihi.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Implicit Neural Representations via Symmetric Power Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose symmetric power transformation to enhance the capacity of Implicit Neural Representation~(INR) from the perspective of data transformation. Unlike prior work utilizing random permutation or index rearrangement, our method features a reversible operation that does not require additional storage consumption. Specifically, we first investigate the characteristics of data that can benefit the training of INR, proposing the Range-Defined Symmetric Hypothesis, which posits that specific range and symmetry can improve the expressive ability of INR. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a nonlinear symmetric power transformation to achieve both range-defined and symmetric properties simultaneously. We use the power coefficient to redistribute data to approximate symmetry within the target range. To improve the robustness of the transformation, we further design deviation-aware calibration and adaptive soft boundary to address issues of extreme deviation boosting and continuity breaking. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed method, demonstrating that our transformation can reliably improve INR compared with other data transformations. We also conduct 1D audio, 2D image and 3D video fitting tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of our method.</description>

      <title>USDRL: Unified Skeleton-Based Dense Representation Learning with Multi-Grained Feature Decorrelation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has achieved great success in skeleton-based representation learning recently. However, the prevailing methods are predominantly negative-based, necessitating additional momentum encoder and memory bank to get negative samples, which increases the difficulty of model training. Furthermore, these methods primarily concentrate on learning a global representation for recognition and retrieval tasks, while overlooking the rich and detailed local representations that are crucial for dense prediction tasks. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a Unified Skeleton-based Dense Representation Learning framework based on feature decorrelation, called USDRL, which employs feature decorrelation across temporal, spatial, and instance domains in a multi-grained manner to reduce redundancy among dimensions of the representations to maximize information extraction from features. Additionally, we design a Dense Spatio-Temporal Encoder (DSTE) to capture fine-grained action representations effectively, thereby enhancing the performance of dense prediction tasks. Comprehensive experiments, conducted on the benchmarks NTU-60, NTU-120, PKU-MMD I, and PKU-MMD II, across diverse downstream tasks including action recognition, action retrieval, and action detection, conclusively demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches.

      <title>DASK: Distribution Rehearsing via Adaptive Style Kernel Learning for Exemplar-Free Lifelong Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) is an important but challenging task that suffers from catastrophic forgetting due to significant domain gaps between training steps. Existing LReID approaches typically rely on data replay and knowledge distillation to mitigate this issue. However, data replay methods compromise data privacy by storing historical exemplars, while knowledge distillation methods suffer from limited performance due to the cumulative forgetting of undistilled knowledge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel paradigm that models and rehearses the distribution of the old domains to enhance knowledge consolidation during the new data learning, possessing a strong anti-forgetting capacity without storing any exemplars. Specifically, we introduce an exemplar-free LReID method called Distribution Rehearsing via Adaptive Style Kernel Learning (DASK). DASK includes a Distribution Rehearser Learning mechanism that learns to transform arbitrary distribution data into the current data style at each learning step. To enhance the style transfer capacity of DRL, an Adaptive Kernel Prediction network is explored to achieve an instance-specific distribution adjustment. Additionally, we design a Distribution Rehearsing-driven LReID Training module, which rehearses old distribution based on the new data via the old AKPNet model, achieving effective new-old knowledge accumulation under a joint knowledge consolidation scheme. Experimental results show our DASK outperforms the existing methods by 3.6%-6.8% and 4.5%-6.5% on anti-forgetting and generalization capacity, respectively.

      <title>UADet: A Remarkably Simple Yet Effective Uncertainty-Aware Open-Set Object Detection Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tackle the challenging problem of Open-Set Object Detection (OSOD), which aims to detect both known and unknown objects in unlabelled images. The main difficulty arises from the absence of supervision for these unknown classes, making it challenging to distinguish them from the background. Existing OSOD detectors either fail to properly exploit or inadequately leverage the abundant unlabeled unknown objects in training data, restricting their performance. To address these limitations, we propose UADet, an Uncertainty-Aware Open-Set Object Detector that considers appearance and geometric uncertainty. By integrating these uncertainty measures, UADet effectively reduces the number of unannotated instances incorrectly utilized or omitted by previous methods. Extensive experiments on OSOD benchmarks demonstrate that UADet substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in detecting both known and unknown objects, achieving a 1.8x improvement in unknown recall while maintaining high performance on known classes. When extended to Open World Object Detection (OWOD), our method shows significant advantages over the current SOTA method, with average improvements of 13.8% and 6.9% in unknown recall on M-OWODB and S-OWODB benchmarks, respectively. Extensive results validate the effectiveness of our uncertainty-aware approach across different open-set scenarios.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models and Adaptive Feature Selection: A Synergistic Approach to Video Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles the intricate challenge of video question-answering (VideoQA). Despite notable progress, current methods fall short of effectively integrating questions with video frames and semantic object-level abstractions to create question-aware video representations. We introduce Local-Global Question Aware Video Embedding (LGQAVE), which incorporates three major innovations to integrate multi-modal knowledge better and emphasize semantic visual concepts relevant to specific questions. LGQAVE moves beyond traditional ad-hoc frame sampling by utilizing a cross-attention mechanism that precisely identifies the most relevant frames concerning the questions. It captures the dynamics of objects within these frames using distinct graphs, grounding them in question semantics with the miniGPT model. These graphs are processed by a question-aware dynamic graph transformer (Q-DGT), which refines the outputs to develop nuanced global and local video representations. An additional cross-attention module integrates these local and global embeddings to generate the final video embeddings, which a language model uses to generate answers. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LGQAVE significantly outperforms existing models in delivering accurate multi-choice and open-ended answers.</description>

      <title>VLMs meet UDA: Boosting Transferability of Open Vocabulary Segmentation with Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation models are typically constrained by the categories defined during training. To address this, researchers have explored two independent approaches: adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and leveraging synthetic data. However, VLMs often struggle with granularity, failing to disentangle fine-grained concepts, while synthetic data-based methods remain limited by the scope of available datasets.
  This paper proposes enhancing segmentation accuracy across diverse domains by integrating Vision-Language reasoning with key strategies for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). First, we improve the fine-grained segmentation capabilities of VLMs through multi-scale contextual data, robust text embeddings with prompt augmentation, and layer-wise fine-tuning in our proposed Foundational-Retaining Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (FROVSS) framework. Next, we incorporate these enhancements into a UDA framework by employing distillation to stabilize training and cross-domain mixed sampling to boost adaptability without compromising generalization. The resulting UDA-FROVSS framework is the first UDA approach to effectively adapt across domains without requiring shared categories.</description>

      <title>FD2-Net: Frequency-Driven Feature Decomposition Network for Infrared-Visible Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection (IVOD) seeks to harness the complementary information in infrared and visible images, thereby enhancing the performance of detectors in complex environments. However, existing methods often neglect the frequency characteristics of complementary information, such as the abundant high-frequency details in visible images and the valuable low-frequency thermal information in infrared images, thus constraining detection performance. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel Frequency-Driven Feature Decomposition Network for IVOD, called FD2-Net, which effectively captures the unique frequency representations of complementary information across multimodal visual spaces. Specifically, we propose a feature decomposition encoder, wherein the high-frequency unit (HFU) utilizes discrete cosine transform to capture representative high-frequency features, while the low-frequency unit (LFU) employs dynamic receptive fields to model the multi-scale context of diverse objects. Next, we adopt a parameter-free complementary strengths strategy to enhance multimodal features through seamless inter-frequency recoupling. Furthermore, we innovatively design a multimodal reconstruction mechanism that recovers image details lost during feature extraction, further leveraging the complementary information from infrared and visible images to enhance overall representational capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FD2-Net outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across various IVOD benchmarks, i.e. LLVIP (96.2% mAP), FLIR (82.9% mAP), and M3FD (83.5% mAP).</description>

      <title>LatentSync: Audio Conditioned Latent Diffusion Models for Lip Sync</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LatentSync, an end-to-end lip sync framework based on audio conditioned latent diffusion models without any intermediate motion representation, diverging from previous diffusion-based lip sync methods based on pixel space diffusion or two-stage generation. Our framework can leverage the powerful capabilities of Stable Diffusion to directly model complex audio-visual correlations. Additionally, we found that the diffusion-based lip sync methods exhibit inferior temporal consistency due to the inconsistency in the diffusion process across different frames. We propose Temporal REPresentation Alignment (TREPA) to enhance temporal consistency while preserving lip-sync accuracy. TREPA uses temporal representations extracted by large-scale self-supervised video models to align the generated frames with the ground truth frames. Furthermore, we observe the commonly encountered SyncNet convergence issue and conduct comprehensive empirical studies, identifying key factors affecting SyncNet convergence in terms of model architecture, training hyperparameters, and data preprocessing methods. We significantly improve the accuracy of SyncNet from 91% to 94% on the HDTF test set. Since we did not change the overall training framework of SyncNet, our experience can also be applied to other lip sync and audio-driven portrait animation methods that utilize SyncNet. Based on the above innovations, our method outperforms state-of-the-art lip sync methods across various metrics on the HDTF and VoxCeleb2 datasets.</description>

      <title>Text-Video Multi-Grained Integration for Video Moment Montage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of online short video platforms has driven a surge in user demand for short video editing. However, manually selecting, cropping, and assembling raw footage into a coherent, high-quality video remains laborious and time-consuming. To accelerate this process, we focus on a user-friendly new task called Video Moment Montage (VMM), which aims to accurately locate the corresponding video segments based on a pre-provided narration text and then arrange these video clips to create a complete video that aligns with the corresponding descriptions. The challenge lies in extracting precise temporal segments while ensuring intra-sentence and inter-sentence context consistency, as a single script sentence may require trimming and assembling multiple video clips. To address this problem, we present a novel \textit{Text-Video Multi-Grained Integration} method (TV-MGI) that efficiently fuses text features from the script with both shot-level and frame-level video features, which enables the global and fine-grained alignment between the video content and the corresponding textual descriptions in the script. To facilitate further research in this area, we introduce the Multiple Sentences with Shots Dataset (MSSD), a large-scale dataset designed explicitly for the VMM task. We conduct extensive experiments on the MSSD dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Towards a Multimodal Large Language Model with Pixel-Level Insight for Biomedicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) have achieved notable advancements, demonstrating the feasibility of developing an intelligent biomedical assistant. However, current biomedical MLLMs predominantly focus on image-level understanding and restrict interactions to textual commands, thus limiting their capability boundaries and the flexibility of usage. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end multimodal large language model for the biomedical domain, named MedPLIB, which possesses pixel-level understanding. Excitingly, it supports visual question answering (VQA), arbitrary pixel-level prompts (points, bounding boxes, and free-form shapes), and pixel-level grounding. We propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) multi-stage training strategy, which divides MoE into separate training phases for a visual-language expert model and a pixel-grounding expert model, followed by fine-tuning using MoE. This strategy effectively coordinates multitask learning while maintaining the computational cost at inference equivalent to that of a single expert model. To advance the research of biomedical MLLMs, we introduce the Medical Complex Vision Question Answering Dataset (MeCoVQA), which comprises an array of 8 modalities for complex medical imaging question answering and image region understanding. Experimental results indicate that MedPLIB has achieved state-of-the-art outcomes across multiple medical visual language tasks. More importantly, in zero-shot evaluations for the pixel grounding task, MedPLIB leads the best small and large models by margins of 19.7 and 15.6 respectively on the mDice metric. The codes, data, and model checkpoints will be made publicly available at https://github.com/ShawnHuang497/MedPLIB.</description>

      <title>InstanceCap: Improving Text-to-Video Generation via Instance-aware Structured Caption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-video generation has evolved rapidly in recent years, delivering remarkable results. Training typically relies on video-caption paired data, which plays a crucial role in enhancing generation performance. However, current video captions often suffer from insufficient details, hallucinations and imprecise motion depiction, affecting the fidelity and consistency of generated videos. In this work, we propose a novel instance-aware structured caption framework, termed InstanceCap, to achieve instance-level and fine-grained video caption for the first time. Based on this scheme, we design an auxiliary models cluster to convert original video into instances to enhance instance fidelity. Video instances are further used to refine dense prompts into structured phrases, achieving concise yet precise descriptions. Furthermore, a 22K InstanceVid dataset is curated for training, and an enhancement pipeline that tailored to InstanceCap structure is proposed for inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed InstanceCap significantly outperform previous models, ensuring high fidelity between captions and videos while reducing hallucinations.</description>

      <title>GoHD: Gaze-oriented and Highly Disentangled Portrait Animation with Rhythmic Poses and Realistic Expression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation necessitates seamless integration of audio and visual data amidst the challenges posed by diverse input portraits and intricate correlations between audio and facial motions. In response, we propose a robust framework GoHD designed to produce highly realistic, expressive, and controllable portrait videos from any reference identity with any motion. GoHD innovates with three key modules: Firstly, an animation module utilizing latent navigation is introduced to improve the generalization ability across unseen input styles. This module achieves high disentanglement of motion and identity, and it also incorporates gaze orientation to rectify unnatural eye movements that were previously overlooked. Secondly, a conformer-structured conditional diffusion model is designed to guarantee head poses that are aware of prosody. Thirdly, to estimate lip-synchronized and realistic expressions from the input audio within limited training data, a two-stage training strategy is devised to decouple frequent and frame-wise lip motion distillation from the generation of other more temporally dependent but less audio-related motions, e.g., blinks and frowns. Extensive experiments validate GoHD's advanced generalization capabilities, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating realistic talking face results on arbitrary subjects.</description>

      <title>Advancing Attribution-Based Neural Network Explainability through Relative Absolute Magnitude Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation and Multi-Component Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancement in deep-neural network performance led to the development of new state-of-the-art approaches in numerous areas. However, the black-box nature of neural networks often prohibits their use in areas where model explainability and model transparency are crucial. Over the years, researchers proposed many algorithms to aid neural network understanding and provide additional information to the human expert. One of the most popular methods being Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). This method assigns local relevance based on the pixel-wise decomposition of nonlinear classifiers. With the rise of attribution method research, there has emerged a pressing need to assess and evaluate their performance. Numerous metrics have been proposed, each assessing an individual property of attribution methods such as faithfulness, robustness or localization. Unfortunately, no single metric is deemed optimal for every case, and researchers often use several metrics to test the quality of the attribution maps. In this work, we address the shortcomings of the current LRP formulations and introduce a novel method for determining the relevance of input neurons through layer-wise relevance propagation. Furthermore, we apply this approach to the recently developed Vision Transformer architecture and evaluate its performance against existing methods on two image classification datasets, namely ImageNet and PascalVOC. Our results clearly demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method. Furthermore, we discuss the insufficiencies of current evaluation metrics for attribution-based explainability and propose a new evaluation metric that combines the notions of faithfulness, robustness and contrastiveness. We utilize this new metric to evaluate the performance of various attribution-based methods.

Abstract: Existing few-shot medical image segmentation (FSMIS) models fail to address a practical issue in medical imaging: the domain shift caused by different imaging techniques, which limits the applicability to current FSMIS tasks. To overcome this limitation, we focus on the cross-domain few-shot medical image segmentation (CD-FSMIS) task, aiming to develop a generalized model capable of adapting to a broader range of medical image segmentation scenarios with limited labeled data from the novel target domain. Inspired by the characteristics of frequency domain similarity across different domains, we propose a Frequency-aware Matching Network (FAMNet), which includes two key components: a Frequency-aware Matching (FAM) module and a Multi-Spectral Fusion (MSF) module. The FAM module tackles two problems during the meta-learning phase: 1) intra-domain variance caused by the inherent support-query bias, due to the different appearances of organs and lesions, and 2) inter-domain variance caused by different medical imaging techniques. Additionally, we design an MSF module to integrate the different frequency features decoupled by the FAM module, and further mitigate the impact of inter-domain variance on the model's segmentation performance. Combining these two modules, our FAMNet surpasses existing FSMIS models and Cross-domain Few-shot Semantic Segmentation models on three cross-domain datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the CD-FSMIS task.</description>

      <title>T-SVG: Text-Driven Stereoscopic Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of stereoscopic videos has opened new horizons in multimedia, particularly in extended reality (XR) and virtual reality (VR) applications, where immersive content captivates audiences across various platforms. Despite its growing popularity, producing stereoscopic videos remains challenging due to the technical complexities involved in generating stereo parallax. This refers to the positional differences of objects viewed from two distinct perspectives and is crucial for creating depth perception. This complex process poses significant challenges for creators aiming to deliver convincing and engaging presentations. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Text-driven Stereoscopic Video Generation (T-SVG) system. This innovative, model-agnostic, zero-shot approach streamlines video generation by using text prompts to create reference videos. These videos are transformed into 3D point cloud sequences, which are rendered from two perspectives with subtle parallax differences, achieving a natural stereoscopic effect. T-SVG represents a significant advancement in stereoscopic content creation by integrating state-of-the-art, training-free techniques in text-to-video generation, depth estimation, and video inpainting. Its flexible architecture ensures high efficiency and user-friendliness, allowing seamless updates with newer models without retraining. By simplifying the production pipeline, T-SVG makes stereoscopic video generation accessible to a broader audience, demonstrating its potential to revolutionize the field.</description>

      <title>Are Conditional Latent Diffusion Models Effective for Image Restoration?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image restoration increasingly employ conditional latent diffusion models (CLDMs). While these models have demonstrated notable performance improvements in recent years, this work questions their suitability for IR tasks. CLDMs excel in capturing high-level semantic correlations, making them effective for tasks like text-to-image generation with spatial conditioning. However, in IR, where the goal is to enhance image perceptual quality, these models face difficulty of modeling the relationship between degraded images and ground truth images using a low-level representation. To support our claims, we compare state-of-the-art CLDMs with traditional image restoration models through extensive experiments. Results reveal that despite the scaling advantages of CLDMs, they suffer from high distortion and semantic deviation, especially in cases with minimal degradation, where traditional methods outperform them. Additionally, we perform empirical studies to examine the impact of various CLDM design elements on their restoration performance. We hope this finding inspires a reexamination of current CLDM-based IR solutions, opening up more opportunities in this field.</description>

      <title>MaskTerial: A Foundation Model for Automated 2D Material Flake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection and classification of exfoliated two-dimensional (2D) material flakes from optical microscope images can be automated using computer vision algorithms. This has the potential to increase the accuracy and objectivity of classification and the efficiency of sample fabrication, and it allows for large-scale data collection. Existing algorithms often exhibit challenges in identifying low-contrast materials and typically require large amounts of training data. Here, we present a deep learning model, called MaskTerial, that uses an instance segmentation network to reliably identify 2D material flakes. The model is extensively pre-trained using a synthetic data generator, that generates realistic microscopy images from unlabeled data. This results in a model that can to quickly adapt to new materials with as little as 5 to 10 images. Furthermore, an uncertainty estimation model is used to finally classify the predictions based on optical contrast. We evaluate our method on eight different datasets comprising five different 2D materials and demonstrate significant improvements over existing techniques in the detection of low-contrast materials such as hexagonal boron nitride.</description>

      <title>DisPose: Disentangling Pose Guidance for Controllable Human Image Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllable human image animation aims to generate videos from reference images using driving videos. Due to the limited control signals provided by sparse guidance (e.g., skeleton pose), recent works have attempted to introduce additional dense conditions (e.g., depth map) to ensure motion alignment. However, such strict dense guidance impairs the quality of the generated video when the body shape of the reference character differs significantly from that of the driving video. In this paper, we present DisPose to mine more generalizable and effective control signals without additional dense input, which disentangles the sparse skeleton pose in human image animation into motion field guidance and keypoint correspondence. Specifically, we generate a dense motion field from a sparse motion field and the reference image, which provides region-level dense guidance while maintaining the generalization of the sparse pose control. We also extract diffusion features corresponding to pose keypoints from the reference image, and then these point features are transferred to the target pose to provide distinct identity information. To seamlessly integrate into existing models, we propose a plug-and-play hybrid ControlNet that improves the quality and consistency of generated videos while freezing the existing model parameters. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of DisPose compared to current methods.

      <title>Causal Graphical Models for Vision-Language Compositional Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has empirically shown that Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to fully understand the compositional properties of the human language, usually modeling an image caption as a "bag of words". As a result, they perform poorly on compositional tasks, which require a deeper understanding of the different entities of a sentence (subject, verb, etc.) jointly with their mutual relationships in order to be solved. In this paper, we model the dependency relations among textual and visual tokens using a Causal Graphical Model (CGM), built using a dependency parser, and we train a decoder conditioned by the VLM visual encoder. Differently from standard autoregressive or parallel predictions, our decoder's generative process is partially-ordered following the CGM structure. This structure encourages the decoder to learn only the main causal dependencies in a sentence discarding spurious correlations. Using extensive experiments on five compositional benchmarks, we show that our method significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art compositional approaches by a large margin, and it also improves over methods trained using much larger datasets.</description>

      <title>All You Need in Knowledge Distillation Is a Tailored Coordinate System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is essential in transferring dark knowledge from a large teacher to a small student network, such that the student can be much more efficient than the teacher but with comparable accuracy. Existing KD methods, however, rely on a large teacher trained specifically for the target task, which is both very inflexible and inefficient. In this paper, we argue that a SSL-pretrained model can effectively act as the teacher and its dark knowledge can be captured by the coordinate system or linear subspace where the features lie in. We then need only one forward pass of the teacher, and then tailor the coordinate system (TCS) for the student network. Our TCS method is teacher-free and applies to diverse architectures, works well for KD and practical few-shot learning, and allows cross-architecture distillation with large capacity gap. Experiments show that TCS achieves significantly higher accuracy than state-of-the-art KD methods, while only requiring roughly half of their training time and GPU memory costs.</description>

      <title>UFO: Enhancing Diffusion-Based Video Generation with a Uniform Frame Organizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, diffusion-based video generation models have achieved significant success. However, existing models often suffer from issues like weak consistency and declining image quality over time. To overcome these challenges, inspired by aesthetic principles, we propose a non-invasive plug-in called Uniform Frame Organizer (UFO), which is compatible with any diffusion-based video generation model. The UFO comprises a series of adaptive adapters with adjustable intensities, which can significantly enhance the consistency between the foreground and background of videos and improve image quality without altering the original model parameters when integrated. The training for UFO is simple, efficient, requires minimal resources, and supports stylized training. Its modular design allows for the combination of multiple UFOs, enabling the customization of personalized video generation models. Furthermore, the UFO also supports direct transferability across different models of the same specification without the need for specific retraining. The experimental results indicate that UFO effectively enhances video generation quality and demonstrates its superiority in public video generation benchmarks. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Delong-liu-bupt/UFO.</description>

      <title>SLAM3R: Real-Time Dense Scene Reconstruction from Monocular RGB Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce \textbf{SLAM3R}, a novel and effective monocular RGB SLAM system for real-time and high-quality dense 3D reconstruction. SLAM3R provides an end-to-end solution by seamlessly integrating local 3D reconstruction and global coordinate registration through feed-forward neural networks. Given an input video, the system first converts it into overlapping clips using a sliding window mechanism. Unlike traditional pose optimization-based methods, SLAM3R directly regresses 3D pointmaps from RGB images in each window and progressively aligns and deforms these local pointmaps to create a globally consistent scene reconstruction - all without explicitly solving any camera parameters. Experiments across datasets consistently show that SLAM3R achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy and completeness while maintaining real-time performance at 20+ FPS.

      <title>MultiEYE: Dataset and Benchmark for OCT-Enhanced Retinal Disease Recognition from Fundus Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing multi-modal learning methods on fundus and OCT images mostly require both modalities to be available and strictly paired for training and testing, which appears less practical in clinical scenarios. To expand the scope of clinical applications, we formulate a novel setting, "OCT-enhanced disease recognition from fundus images", that allows for the use of unpaired multi-modal data during the training phase and relies on the widespread fundus photographs for testing. To benchmark this setting, we present the first large multi-modal multi-class dataset for eye disease diagnosis, MultiEYE, and propose an OCT-assisted Conceptual Distillation Approach (OCT-CoDA), which employs semantically rich concepts to extract disease-related knowledge from OCT images and leverage them into the fundus model. Specifically, we regard the image-concept relation as a link to distill useful knowledge from the OCT teacher model to the fundus student model, which considerably improves the diagnostic performance based on fundus images and formulates the cross-modal knowledge transfer into an explainable process. Through extensive experiments on the multi-disease classification task, our proposed OCT-CoDA demonstrates remarkable results and interpretability, showing great potential for clinical application. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/MultiEYE.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Music Generation with Explicit Bridges and Retrieval Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal music generation aims to produce music from diverse input modalities, including text, videos, and images. Existing methods use a common embedding space for multimodal fusion. Despite their effectiveness in other modalities, their application in multimodal music generation faces challenges of data scarcity, weak cross-modal alignment, and limited controllability. This paper addresses these issues by using explicit bridges of text and music for multimodal alignment. We introduce a novel method named Visuals Music Bridge (VMB). Specifically, a Multimodal Music Description Model converts visual inputs into detailed textual descriptions to provide the text bridge; a Dual-track Music Retrieval module that combines broad and targeted retrieval strategies to provide the music bridge and enable user control. Finally, we design an Explicitly Conditioned Music Generation framework to generate music based on the two bridges. We conduct experiments on video-to-music, image-to-music, text-to-music, and controllable music generation tasks, along with experiments on controllability. The results demonstrate that VMB significantly enhances music quality, modality, and customization alignment compared to previous methods. VMB sets a new standard for interpretable and expressive multimodal music generation with applications in various multimedia fields. Demos and code are available at https://github.com/wbs2788/VMB.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust and Fair Vision Learning in Open-World Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dissertation presents four key contributions toward fairness and robustness in vision learning. First, to address the problem of large-scale data requirements, the dissertation presents a novel Fairness Domain Adaptation approach derived from two major novel research findings of Bijective Maximum Likelihood and Fairness Adaptation Learning. Second, to enable the capability of open-world modeling of vision learning, this dissertation presents a novel Open-world Fairness Continual Learning Framework. The success of this research direction is the result of two research lines, i.e., Fairness Continual Learning and Open-world Continual Learning. Third, since visual data are often captured from multiple camera views, robust vision learning methods should be capable of modeling invariant features across views. To achieve this desired goal, the research in this thesis will present a novel Geometry-based Cross-view Adaptation framework to learn robust feature representations across views. Finally, with the recent increase in large-scale videos and multimodal data, understanding the feature representations and improving the robustness of large-scale visual foundation models is critical. Therefore, this thesis will present novel Transformer-based approaches to improve the robust feature representations against multimodal and temporal data. Then, a novel Domain Generalization Approach will be presented to improve the robustness of visual foundation models. The research's theoretical analysis and experimental results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, demonstrating their superior performance compared to prior studies. The contributions in this dissertation have advanced the fairness and robustness of machine vision learning.</description>

      <title>ATPrompt: Textual Prompt Learning with Embedded Attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Textual-based prompt learning methods primarily employ multiple learnable soft prompts and hard class tokens in a cascading manner as text prompt inputs, aiming to align image and text (category) spaces for downstream tasks. However, current training is restricted to aligning images with predefined known categories and cannot be associated with unknown categories. In this work, we propose utilizing universal attributes as a bridge to enhance the alignment between images and unknown categories. Specifically, we introduce an Attribute-embedded Textual Prompt learning method for vision-language models, named ATPrompt. This approach expands the learning space of soft prompts from the original one-dimensional category level into the multi-dimensional attribute level by incorporating multiple universal attribute tokens into the learnable soft prompts. Through this modification, we transform the text prompt from a category-centric form to an attribute-category hybrid form. To finalize the attributes for downstream tasks, we propose a differentiable attribute search method that learns to identify representative and suitable attributes from a candidate pool summarized by a large language model. As an easy-to-use plug-in technique, ATPrompt can seamlessly replace the existing prompt format of textual-based methods, offering general improvements at a negligible computational cost. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>OFTSR: One-Step Flow for Image Super-Resolution with Tunable Fidelity-Realism Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion and flow-based generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in image restoration tasks, achieving superior perceptual quality compared to traditional deep learning approaches. However, these methods either require numerous sampling steps to generate high-quality images, resulting in significant computational overhead, or rely on model distillation, which usually imposes a fixed fidelity-realism trade-off and thus lacks flexibility. In this paper, we introduce OFTSR, a novel flow-based framework for one-step image super-resolution that can produce outputs with tunable levels of fidelity and realism. Our approach first trains a conditional flow-based super-resolution model to serve as a teacher model. We then distill this teacher model by applying a specialized constraint. Specifically, we force the predictions from our one-step student model for same input to lie on the same sampling ODE trajectory of the teacher model. This alignment ensures that the student model's single-step predictions from initial states match the teacher's predictions from a closer intermediate state. Through extensive experiments on challenging datasets including FFHQ (256$\times$256), DIV2K, and ImageNet (256$\times$256), we demonstrate that OFTSR achieves state-of-the-art performance for one-step image super-resolution, while having the ability to flexibly tune the fidelity-realism trade-off. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/yuanzhi-zhu/OFTSR and https://huggingface.co/Yuanzhi/OFTSR, respectively.</description>

      <title>New keypoint-based approach for recognising British Sign Language (BSL) from sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel keypoint-based classification model designed to recognise British Sign Language (BSL) words within continuous signing sequences. Our model's performance is assessed using the BOBSL dataset, revealing that the keypoint-based approach surpasses its RGB-based counterpart in computational efficiency and memory usage. Furthermore, it offers expedited training times and demands fewer computational resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the inaugural application of a keypoint-based model for BSL word classification, rendering direct comparisons with existing works unavailable.</description>

      <title>Lyra: An Efficient and Speech-Centric Framework for Omni-Cognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) evolve, expanding beyond single-domain capabilities is essential to meet the demands for more versatile and efficient AI. However, previous omni-models have insufficiently explored speech, neglecting its integration with multi-modality. We introduce Lyra, an efficient MLLM that enhances multimodal abilities, including advanced long-speech comprehension, sound understanding, cross-modality efficiency, and seamless speech interaction. To achieve efficiency and speech-centric capabilities, Lyra employs three strategies: (1) leveraging existing open-source large models and a proposed multi-modality LoRA to reduce training costs and data requirements; (2) using a latent multi-modality regularizer and extractor to strengthen the relationship between speech and other modalities, thereby enhancing model performance; and (3) constructing a high-quality, extensive dataset that includes 1.5M multi-modal (language, vision, audio) data samples and 12K long speech samples, enabling Lyra to handle complex long speech inputs and achieve more robust omni-cognition. Compared to other omni-methods, Lyra achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language, vision-speech, and speech-language benchmarks, while also using fewer computational resources and less training data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable success in achieving state-of-the-art performance across various image-based tasks and beyond. In this study, we employ a ViT-based neural network to address the problem of indoor pathloss radio map prediction. The network's generalization ability is evaluated across diverse settings, including unseen buildings, frequencies, and antennas with varying radiation patterns. By leveraging extensive data augmentation techniques and pretrained DINOv2 weights, we achieve promising results, even under the most challenging scenarios.</description>

      <title>GEAL: Generalizable 3D Affordance Learning with Cross-Modal Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying affordance regions on 3D objects from semantic cues is essential for robotics and human-machine interaction. However, existing 3D affordance learning methods struggle with generalization and robustness due to limited annotated data and a reliance on 3D backbones focused on geometric encoding, which often lack resilience to real-world noise and data corruption. We propose GEAL, a novel framework designed to enhance the generalization and robustness of 3D affordance learning by leveraging large-scale pre-trained 2D models. We employ a dual-branch architecture with Gaussian splatting to establish consistent mappings between 3D point clouds and 2D representations, enabling realistic 2D renderings from sparse point clouds. A granularity-adaptive fusion module and a 2D-3D consistency alignment module further strengthen cross-modal alignment and knowledge transfer, allowing the 3D branch to benefit from the rich semantics and generalization capacity of 2D models. To holistically assess the robustness, we introduce two new corruption-based benchmarks: PIAD-C and LASO-C. Extensive experiments on public datasets and our benchmarks show that GEAL consistently outperforms existing methods across seen and novel object categories, as well as corrupted data, demonstrating robust and adaptable affordance prediction under diverse conditions. Code and corruption datasets have been made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Agent-based Video Trimming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As information becomes more accessible, user-generated videos are increasing in length, placing a burden on viewers to sift through vast content for valuable insights. This trend underscores the need for an algorithm to extract key video information efficiently. Despite significant advancements in highlight detection, moment retrieval, and video summarization, current approaches primarily focus on selecting specific time intervals, often overlooking the relevance between segments and the potential for segment arranging. In this paper, we introduce a novel task called Video Trimming (VT), which focuses on detecting wasted footage, selecting valuable segments, and composing them into a final video with a coherent story. To address this task, we propose Agent-based Video Trimming (AVT), structured into three phases: Video Structuring, Clip Filtering, and Story Composition. Specifically, we employ a Video Captioning Agent to convert video slices into structured textual descriptions, a Filtering Module to dynamically discard low-quality footage based on the structured information of each clip, and a Video Arrangement Agent to select and compile valid clips into a coherent final narrative. For evaluation, we develop a Video Evaluation Agent to assess trimmed videos, conducting assessments in parallel with human evaluations. Additionally, we curate a new benchmark dataset for video trimming using raw user videos from the internet. As a result, AVT received more favorable evaluations in user studies and demonstrated superior mAP and precision on the YouTube Highlights, TVSum, and our own dataset for the highlight detection task. The code and models are available at https://ylingfeng.github.io/AVT.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Comprehensive Feature Extraction in Large Vision-Language Model for Clinical Pathology Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pathological diagnosis is vital for determining disease characteristics, guiding treatment, and assessing prognosis, relying heavily on detailed, multi-scale analysis of high-resolution whole slide images (WSI). However, traditional pure vision models face challenges of redundant feature extraction, whereas existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) are limited by input resolution constraints, hindering their efficiency and accuracy. To overcome these issues, we propose two innovative strategies: the mixed task-guided feature enhancement, which directs feature extraction toward lesion-related details across scales, and the prompt-guided detail feature completion, which integrates coarse- and fine-grained features from WSI based on specific prompts without compromising inference speed. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 490,000 samples from diverse pathology tasks-including cancer detection, grading, vascular and neural invasion identification, and so on-we trained the pathology-specialized LVLM, OmniPath. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this model significantly outperforms existing methods in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, offering an interactive, clinically aligned approach for auxiliary diagnosis in a wide range of pathology applications.</description>

      <title>Can Modern LLMs Act as Agent Cores in Radiology~Environments?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have paved the way for LLM-based agent systems that offer enhanced accuracy and interpretability across various domains. Radiology, with its complex analytical requirements, is an ideal field for the application of these agents. This paper aims to investigate the pre-requisite question for building concrete radiology agents which is, `Can modern LLMs act as agent cores in radiology environments?' To investigate it, we introduce RadABench with three-fold contributions: First, we present RadABench-Data, a comprehensive synthetic evaluation dataset for LLM-based agents, generated from an extensive taxonomy encompassing 6 anatomies, 5 imaging modalities, 10 tool categories, and 11 radiology tasks. Second, we propose RadABench-EvalPlat, a novel evaluation platform for agents featuring a prompt-driven workflow and the capability to simulate a wide range of radiology toolsets. Third, we assess the performance of 7 leading LLMs on our benchmark from 5 perspectives with multiple metrics. Our findings indicate that while current LLMs demonstrate strong capabilities in many areas, they are still not sufficiently advanced to serve as the central agent core in a fully operational radiology agent system. Additionally, we identify key factors influencing the performance of LLM-based agent cores, offering insights for clinicians on how to apply agent systems in real-world radiology practices effectively. All of our code and data are open-sourced in https://github.com/MAGIC-AI4Med/RadABench.</description>

      <title>Dynamic-VLM: Simple Dynamic Visual Token Compression for VideoLLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for analyzing images and videos is an exciting and rapidly evolving field. In recent years, we've seen significant growth in high-quality image-text datasets for fine-tuning image understanding, but there is still a lack of comparable datasets for videos. Additionally, many VideoLLMs are extensions of single-image VLMs, which may not efficiently handle the complexities of longer videos. In this study, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset created from proprietary models, using carefully designed prompts to tackle a wide range of questions. We also explore a dynamic visual token compression architecture that strikes a balance between computational efficiency and performance. Our proposed \model{} achieves state-of-the-art results across various video tasks and shows impressive generalization, setting new baselines in multi-image understanding. Notably, \model{} delivers an absolute improvement of 2.7\% over LLaVA-OneVision on VideoMME and 10.7\% on MuirBench. Codes are available at https://github.com/Hon-Wong/ByteVideoLLM</description>

      <title>SimAvatar: Simulation-Ready Avatars with Layered Hair and Clothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SimAvatar, a framework designed to generate simulation-ready clothed 3D human avatars from a text prompt. Current text-driven human avatar generation methods either model hair, clothing, and the human body using a unified geometry or produce hair and garments that are not easily adaptable for simulation within existing simulation pipelines. The primary challenge lies in representing the hair and garment geometry in a way that allows leveraging established prior knowledge from foundational image diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) while being simulation-ready using either physics or neural simulators. To address this task, we propose a two-stage framework that combines the flexibility of 3D Gaussians with simulation-ready hair strands and garment meshes. Specifically, we first employ three text-conditioned 3D generative models to generate garment mesh, body shape and hair strands from the given text prompt. To leverage prior knowledge from foundational diffusion models, we attach 3D Gaussians to the body mesh, garment mesh, as well as hair strands and learn the avatar appearance through optimization. To drive the avatar given a pose sequence, we first apply physics simulators onto the garment meshes and hair strands. We then transfer the motion onto 3D Gaussians through carefully designed mechanisms for each body part. As a result, our synthesized avatars have vivid texture and realistic dynamic motion. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to produce highly realistic, fully simulation-ready 3D avatars, surpassing the capabilities of current approaches.</description>

      <title>Exemplar Masking for Multimodal Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal incremental learning needs to digest the information from multiple modalities while concurrently learning new knowledge without forgetting the previously learned information. There are numerous challenges for this task, mainly including the larger storage size of multimodal data in exemplar-based methods and the computational requirement of finetuning on huge multimodal models. In this paper, we leverage the parameter-efficient tuning scheme to reduce the burden of fine-tuning and propose the exemplar masking framework to efficiently replay old knowledge. Specifically, the non-important tokens are masked based on the attention weights and the correlation across different modalities, significantly reducing the storage size of an exemplar and consequently saving more exemplars under the same memory buffer. Moreover, we design a multimodal data augmentation technique to diversify exemplars for replaying prior knowledge. In experiments, we not only evaluate our method in existing multimodal datasets but also extend the ImageNet-R dataset to a multimodal dataset as a real-world application, where captions are generated by querying multimodal large language models (e.g., InstructBLIP). Extensive experiments show that our exemplar masking framework is more efficient and robust to catastrophic forgetting under the same limited memory buffer.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a novel video creation experience, namely Video Creation by Demonstration. Given a demonstration video and a context image from a different scene, we generate a physically plausible video that continues naturally from the context image and carries out the action concepts from the demonstration. To enable this capability, we present $\delta$-Diffusion, a self-supervised training approach that learns from unlabeled videos by conditional future frame prediction. Unlike most existing video generation controls that are based on explicit signals, we adopts the form of implicit latent control for maximal flexibility and expressiveness required by general videos. By leveraging a video foundation model with an appearance bottleneck design on top, we extract action latents from demonstration videos for conditioning the generation process with minimal appearance leakage. Empirically, $\delta$-Diffusion outperforms related baselines in terms of both human preference and large-scale machine evaluations, and demonstrates potentials towards interactive world simulation. Sampled video generation results are available at https://delta-diffusion.github.io/.</description>

      <title>FreeSplatter: Pose-free Gaussian Splatting for Sparse-view 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing sparse-view reconstruction models heavily rely on accurate known camera poses. However, deriving camera extrinsics and intrinsics from sparse-view images presents significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeSplatter, a highly scalable, feed-forward reconstruction framework capable of generating high-quality 3D Gaussians from uncalibrated sparse-view images and recovering their camera parameters in mere seconds. FreeSplatter is built upon a streamlined transformer architecture, comprising sequential self-attention blocks that facilitate information exchange among multi-view image tokens and decode them into pixel-wise 3D Gaussian primitives. The predicted Gaussian primitives are situated in a unified reference frame, allowing for high-fidelity 3D modeling and instant camera parameter estimation using off-the-shelf solvers. To cater to both object-centric and scene-level reconstruction, we train two model variants of FreeSplatter on extensive datasets. In both scenarios, FreeSplatter outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of reconstruction quality and pose estimation accuracy. Furthermore, we showcase FreeSplatter's potential in enhancing the productivity of downstream applications, such as text/image-to-3D content creation.</description>

      <title>OLA-VLM: Elevating Visual Perception in Multimodal LLMs with Auxiliary Embedding Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard practice for developing contemporary MLLMs is to feed features from vision encoder(s) into the LLM and train with natural language supervision. In this work, we posit an overlooked opportunity to optimize the intermediate LLM representations through a vision perspective (objective), i.e., solely natural language supervision is sub-optimal for the MLLM's visual understanding ability. To that end, we propose OLA-VLM, the first approach distilling knowledge into the LLM's hidden representations from a set of target visual representations. Firstly, we formulate the objective during the pretraining stage in MLLMs as a coupled optimization of predictive visual embedding and next text-token prediction. Secondly, we investigate MLLMs trained solely with natural language supervision and identify a positive correlation between the quality of visual representations within these models and their downstream performance. Moreover, upon probing our OLA-VLM, we observe improved representation quality owing to the embedding optimization. Thirdly, we demonstrate that our OLA-VLM outperforms the single and multi-encoder baselines, proving our approach's superiority over explicitly feeding the corresponding features to the LLM. Particularly, OLA-VLM boosts performance by an average margin of up to 2.5% on various benchmarks, with a notable improvement of 8.7% on the Depth task in CV-Bench.

      <title>Gaze-LLE: Gaze Target Estimation via Large-Scale Learned Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of gaze target estimation, which aims to predict where a person is looking in a scene. Predicting a person's gaze target requires reasoning both about the person's appearance and the contents of the scene. Prior works have developed increasingly complex, hand-crafted pipelines for gaze target estimation that carefully fuse features from separate scene encoders, head encoders, and auxiliary models for signals like depth and pose. Motivated by the success of general-purpose feature extractors on a variety of visual tasks, we propose Gaze-LLE, a novel transformer framework that streamlines gaze target estimation by leveraging features from a frozen DINOv2 encoder. We extract a single feature representation for the scene, and apply a person-specific positional prompt to decode gaze with a lightweight module. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across several gaze benchmarks and provide extensive analysis to validate our design choices.

      <title>Neural LightRig: Unlocking Accurate Object Normal and Material Estimation with Multi-Light Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering the geometry and materials of objects from a single image is challenging due to its under-constrained nature. In this paper, we present Neural LightRig, a novel framework that boosts intrinsic estimation by leveraging auxiliary multi-lighting conditions from 2D diffusion priors. Specifically, 1) we first leverage illumination priors from large-scale diffusion models to build our multi-light diffusion model on a synthetic relighting dataset with dedicated designs. This diffusion model generates multiple consistent images, each illuminated by point light sources in different directions. 2) By using these varied lighting images to reduce estimation uncertainty, we train a large G-buffer model with a U-Net backbone to accurately predict surface normals and materials. Extensive experiments validate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, enabling accurate surface normal and PBR material estimation with vivid relighting effects. Code and dataset are available on our project page at https://projects.zxhezexin.com/neural-lightrig.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating AI systems that can interact with environments over long periods, similar to human cognition, has been a longstanding research goal. Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in open-world understanding. However, the challenge of continuous and simultaneous streaming perception, memory, and reasoning remains largely unexplored. Current MLLMs are constrained by their sequence-to-sequence architecture, which limits their ability to process inputs and generate responses simultaneously, akin to being unable to think while perceiving. Furthermore, relying on long contexts to store historical data is impractical for long-term interactions, as retaining all information becomes costly and inefficient. Therefore, rather than relying on a single foundation model to perform all functions, this project draws inspiration from the concept of the Specialized Generalist AI and introduces disentangled streaming perception, reasoning, and memory mechanisms, enabling real-time interaction with streaming video and audio input. The proposed framework InternLM-XComposer2.5-OmniLive (IXC2.5-OL) consists of three key modules: (1) Streaming Perception Module: Processes multimodal information in real-time, storing key details in memory and triggering reasoning in response to user queries. (2) Multi-modal Long Memory Module: Integrates short-term and long-term memory, compressing short-term memories into long-term ones for efficient retrieval and improved accuracy. (3) Reasoning Module: Responds to queries and executes reasoning tasks, coordinating with the perception and memory modules. This project simulates human-like cognition, enabling multimodal large language models to provide continuous and adaptive service over time.</description>

      <title>LiftImage3D: Lifting Any Single Image to 3D Gaussians with Video Generation Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-image 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision due to inherent geometric ambiguities and limited viewpoint information. Recent advances in Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) offer promising 3D priors learned from large-scale video data. However, leveraging these priors effectively faces three key challenges: (1) degradation in quality across large camera motions, (2) difficulties in achieving precise camera control, and (3) geometric distortions inherent to the diffusion process that damage 3D consistency. We address these challenges by proposing LiftImage3D, a framework that effectively releases LVDMs' generative priors while ensuring 3D consistency. Specifically, we design an articulated trajectory strategy to generate video frames, which decomposes video sequences with large camera motions into ones with controllable small motions. Then we use robust neural matching models, i.e. MASt3R, to calibrate the camera poses of generated frames and produce corresponding point clouds. Finally, we propose a distortion-aware 3D Gaussian splatting representation, which can learn independent distortions between frames and output undistorted canonical Gaussians. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LiftImage3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging datasets, i.e. LLFF, DL3DV, and Tanks and Temples, and generalizes well to diverse in-the-wild images, from cartoon illustrations to complex real-world scenes.</description>

      <title>RatBodyFormer: Rodent Body Surface from Keypoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rat behavior modeling goes to the heart of many scientific studies, yet the textureless body surface evades automatic analysis as it literally has no keypoints that detectors can find. The movement of the body surface, however, is a rich source of information for deciphering the rat behavior. We introduce two key contributions to automatically recover densely 3D sampled rat body surface points, passively. The first is RatDome, a novel multi-camera system for rat behavior capture, and a large-scale dataset captured with it that consists of pairs of 3D keypoints and 3D body surface points. The second is RatBodyFormer, a novel network to transform detected keypoints to 3D body surface points. RatBodyFormer is agnostic to the exact locations of the 3D body surface points in the training data and is trained with masked-learning. We experimentally validate our framework with a number of real-world experiments. Our results collectively serve as a novel foundation for automated rat behavior analysis and will likely have far-reaching implications for biomedical and neuroscientific research.</description>

      <title>Owl-1: Omni World Model for Consistent Long Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generation models (VGMs) have received extensive attention recently and serve as promising candidates for general-purpose large vision models. While they can only generate short videos each time, existing methods achieve long video generation by iteratively calling the VGMs, using the last-frame output as the condition for the next-round generation. However, the last frame only contains short-term fine-grained information about the scene, resulting in inconsistency in the long horizon. To address this, we propose an Omni World modeL (Owl-1) to produce long-term coherent and comprehensive conditions for consistent long video generation. As videos are observations of the underlying evolving world, we propose to model the long-term developments in a latent space and use VGMs to film them into videos. Specifically, we represent the world with a latent state variable which can be decoded into explicit video observations. These observations serve as a basis for anticipating temporal dynamics which in turn update the state variable. The interaction between evolving dynamics and persistent state enhances the diversity and consistency of the long videos. Extensive experiments show that Owl-1 achieves comparable performance with SOTA methods on VBench-I2V and VBench-Long, validating its ability to generate high-quality video observations.

      <title>TimeRefine: Temporal Grounding with Time Refining Video LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video temporal grounding aims to localize relevant temporal boundaries in a video given a textual prompt. Recent work has focused on enabling Video LLMs to perform video temporal grounding via next-token prediction of temporal timestamps. However, accurately localizing timestamps in videos remains challenging for Video LLMs when relying solely on temporal token prediction. Our proposed TimeRefine addresses this challenge in two ways. First, instead of directly predicting the start and end timestamps, we reformulate the temporal grounding task as a temporal refining task: the model first makes rough predictions and then refines them by predicting offsets to the target segment. This refining process is repeated multiple times, through which the model progressively self-improves its temporal localization accuracy. Second, to enhance the model's temporal perception capabilities, we incorporate an auxiliary prediction head that penalizes the model more if a predicted segment deviates further from the ground truth, thus encouraging the model to make closer and more accurate predictions. Our plug-and-play method can be integrated into most LLM-based temporal grounding approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that TimeRefine achieves 3.6% and 5.0% mIoU improvements on the ActivityNet and Charades-STA datasets, respectively. Code and pretrained models will be released.</description>

      <title>Hidden Biases of End-to-End Driving Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end driving systems have made rapid progress, but have so far not been applied to the challenging new CARLA Leaderboard 2.0. Further, while there is a large body of literature on end-to-end architectures and training strategies, the impact of the training dataset is often overlooked. In this work, we make a first attempt at end-to-end driving for Leaderboard 2.0. Instead of investigating architectures, we systematically analyze the training dataset, leading to new insights: (1) Expert style significantly affects downstream policy performance. (2) In complex data sets, the frames should not be weighted on the basis of simplistic criteria such as class frequencies. (3) Instead, estimating whether a frame changes the target labels compared to previous frames can reduce the size of the dataset without removing important information. By incorporating these findings, our model ranks first and second respectively on the map and sensors tracks of the 2024 CARLA Challenge, and sets a new state-of-the-art on the Bench2Drive test routes. Finally, we uncover a design flaw in the current evaluation metrics and propose a modification for future challenges. Our dataset, code, and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/autonomousvision/carla_garage.</description>

      <title>Do Multimodal Large Language Models See Like Humans?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, leveraging recent advancements in large language models. However, a critical question remains unaddressed: do MLLMs perceive visual information similarly to humans? Current benchmarks lack the ability to evaluate MLLMs from this perspective. To address this challenge, we introduce HVSBench, a large-scale benchmark designed to assess the alignment between MLLMs and the human visual system (HVS) on fundamental vision tasks that mirror human vision. HVSBench curated over 85K multimodal samples, spanning 13 categories and 5 fields in HVS, including Prominence, Subitizing, Prioritizing, Free-Viewing, and Searching. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in providing a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs. Specifically, we evaluate 13 MLLMs, revealing that even the best models show significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results. Our experiments reveal that HVSBench presents a new and significant challenge for cutting-edge MLLMs. We believe that HVSBench will facilitate research on human-aligned and explainable MLLMs, marking a key step in understanding how MLLMs perceive and process visual information.</description>

      <title>SynerGen-VL: Towards Synergistic Image Understanding and Generation with Vision Experts and Token Folding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended to the multimodal domain, achieving outstanding performance in image understanding and generation. Recent efforts to develop unified Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that integrate these capabilities have shown promising results. However, existing approaches often involve complex designs in model architecture or training pipeline, increasing the difficulty of model training and scaling. In this paper, we propose SynerGen-VL, a simple yet powerful encoder-free MLLM capable of both image understanding and generation. To address challenges identified in existing encoder-free unified MLLMs, we introduce the token folding mechanism and the vision-expert-based progressive alignment pretraining strategy, which effectively support high-resolution image understanding while reducing training complexity. After being trained on large-scale mixed image-text data with a unified next-token prediction objective, SynerGen-VL achieves or surpasses the performance of existing encoder-free unified MLLMs with comparable or smaller parameter sizes, and narrows the gap with task-specific state-of-the-art models, highlighting a promising path toward future unified MLLMs. Our code and models shall be released.</description>

      <title>Feat2GS: Probing Visual Foundation Models with Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given that visual foundation models (VFMs) are trained on extensive datasets but often limited to 2D images, a natural question arises: how well do they understand the 3D world? With the differences in architecture and training protocols (i.e., objectives, proxy tasks), a unified framework to fairly and comprehensively probe their 3D awareness is urgently needed. Existing works on 3D probing suggest single-view 2.5D estimation (e.g., depth and normal) or two-view sparse 2D correspondence (e.g., matching and tracking). Unfortunately, these tasks ignore texture awareness, and require 3D data as ground-truth, which limits the scale and diversity of their evaluation set. To address these issues, we introduce Feat2GS, which readout 3D Gaussians attributes from VFM features extracted from unposed images. This allows us to probe 3D awareness for geometry and texture via novel view synthesis, without requiring 3D data. Additionally, the disentanglement of 3DGS parameters - geometry ($\boldsymbol{x}, \alpha, \Sigma$) and texture ($\boldsymbol{c}$) - enables separate analysis of texture and geometry awareness. Under Feat2GS, we conduct extensive experiments to probe the 3D awareness of several VFMs, and investigate the ingredients that lead to a 3D aware VFM. Building on these findings, we develop several variants that achieve state-of-the-art across diverse datasets. This makes Feat2GS useful for probing VFMs, and as a simple-yet-effective baseline for novel-view synthesis. Code and data will be made available at https://fanegg.github.io/Feat2GS/.</description>

      <title>Spectral Image Tokenizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image tokenizers map images to sequences of discrete tokens, and are a crucial component of autoregressive transformer-based image generation. The tokens are typically associated with spatial locations in the input image, arranged in raster scan order, which is not ideal for autoregressive modeling. In this paper, we propose to tokenize the image spectrum instead, obtained from a discrete wavelet transform (DWT), such that the sequence of tokens represents the image in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Our tokenizer brings several advantages: 1) it leverages that natural images are more compressible at high frequencies, 2) it can take and reconstruct images of different resolutions without retraining, 3) it improves the conditioning for next-token prediction -- instead of conditioning on a partial line-by-line reconstruction of the image, it takes a coarse reconstruction of the full image, 4) it enables partial decoding where the first few generated tokens can reconstruct a coarse version of the image, 5) it enables autoregressive models to be used for image upsampling. We evaluate the tokenizer reconstruction metrics as well as multiscale image generation, text-guided image upsampling and editing.</description>

      <title>Representing Long Volumetric Video with Temporal Gaussian Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to address the challenge of reconstructing long volumetric videos from multi-view RGB videos. Recent dynamic view synthesis methods leverage powerful 4D representations, like feature grids or point cloud sequences, to achieve high-quality rendering results. However, they are typically limited to short (1~2s) video clips and often suffer from large memory footprints when dealing with longer videos. To solve this issue, we propose a novel 4D representation, named Temporal Gaussian Hierarchy, to compactly model long volumetric videos. Our key observation is that there are generally various degrees of temporal redundancy in dynamic scenes, which consist of areas changing at different speeds. Motivated by this, our approach builds a multi-level hierarchy of 4D Gaussian primitives, where each level separately describes scene regions with different degrees of content change, and adaptively shares Gaussian primitives to represent unchanged scene content over different temporal segments, thus effectively reducing the number of Gaussian primitives. In addition, the tree-like structure of the Gaussian hierarchy allows us to efficiently represent the scene at a particular moment with a subset of Gaussian primitives, leading to nearly constant GPU memory usage during the training or rendering regardless of the video length. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over alternative methods in terms of training cost, rendering speed, and storage usage. To our knowledge, this work is the first approach capable of efficiently handling minutes of volumetric video data while maintaining state-of-the-art rendering quality.

      <title>FluxSpace: Disentangled Semantic Editing in Rectified Flow Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rectified flow models have emerged as a dominant approach in image generation, showcasing impressive capabilities in high-quality image synthesis. However, despite their effectiveness in visual generation, rectified flow models often struggle with disentangled editing of images. This limitation prevents the ability to perform precise, attribute-specific modifications without affecting unrelated aspects of the image. In this paper, we introduce FluxSpace, a domain-agnostic image editing method leveraging a representation space with the ability to control the semantics of images generated by rectified flow transformers, such as Flux. By leveraging the representations learned by the transformer blocks within the rectified flow models, we propose a set of semantically interpretable representations that enable a wide range of image editing tasks, from fine-grained image editing to artistic creation. This work offers a scalable and effective image editing approach, along with its disentanglement capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Olympus, a new approach that transforms Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into a unified framework capable of handling a wide array of computer vision tasks. Utilizing a controller MLLM, Olympus delegates over 20 specialized tasks across images, videos, and 3D objects to dedicated modules. This instruction-based routing enables complex workflows through chained actions without the need for training heavy generative models. Olympus easily integrates with existing MLLMs, expanding their capabilities with comparable performance. Experimental results demonstrate that Olympus achieves an average routing accuracy of 94.75% across 20 tasks and precision of 91.82% in chained action scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness as a universal task router that can solve a diverse range of computer vision tasks.

      <title>PVC: Progressive Visual Token Compression for Unified Image and Video Processing in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been extended to understand both images and videos. Visual token compression is leveraged to reduce the considerable token length of visual inputs. To meet the needs of different tasks, existing high-performance models usually process images and videos separately with different token compression strategies, limiting the capabilities of combining images and videos. To this end, we extend each image into a "static" video and introduce a unified token compression strategy called Progressive Visual Token Compression (PVC), where the tokens of each frame are progressively encoded and adaptively compressed to supplement the information not extracted from previous frames. Video tokens are efficiently compressed with exploiting the inherent temporal redundancy. Images are repeated as static videos, and the spatial details can be gradually supplemented in multiple frames. PVC unifies the token compressing of images and videos. With a limited number of tokens per frame (64 tokens by default), spatial details and temporal changes can still be preserved. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across various video understanding benchmarks, including long video tasks and fine-grained short video tasks. Meanwhile, our unified token compression strategy incurs no performance loss on image benchmarks, particularly in detail-sensitive tasks.</description>

      <title>Context Canvas: Enhancing Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Knowledge Graph-Based RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to enhance the capabilities of text-to-image models by incorporating a graph-based RAG. Our system dynamically retrieves detailed character information and relational data from the knowledge graph, enabling the generation of visually accurate and contextually rich images. This capability significantly improves upon the limitations of existing T2I models, which often struggle with the accurate depiction of complex or culturally specific subjects due to dataset constraints. Furthermore, we propose a novel self-correcting mechanism for text-to-image models to ensure consistency and fidelity in visual outputs, leveraging the rich context from the graph to guide corrections. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that Context Canvas significantly enhances the capabilities of popular models such as Flux, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E, and improves the functionality of ControlNet for fine-grained image editing tasks. To our knowledge, Context Canvas represents the first application of graph-based RAG in enhancing T2I models, representing a significant advancement for producing high-fidelity, context-aware multi-faceted images.</description>

      <title>V2PE: Improving Multimodal Long-Context Capability of Vision-Language Models with Variable Visual Position Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising capabilities in handling various multimodal tasks, yet they struggle in long-context scenarios, particularly in tasks involving videos, high-resolution images, or lengthy image-text documents. In our work, we first conduct an empirical analysis of the long-context capabilities of VLMs using our augmented long-context multimodal datasets. Our findings reveal that directly applying the positional encoding mechanism used for textual tokens to visual tokens is suboptimal, and VLM performance degrades sharply when the position encoding exceeds the model's context window. To address this, we propose Variable Visual Position Encoding (V2PE), a novel positional encoding approach that employs variable and smaller increments for visual tokens, enabling more efficient management of long multimodal sequences. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of V2PE to enhances VLMs' ability to effectively understand and reason over long multimodal contexts. We further integrate V2PE with our augmented long-context multimodal datasets to fine-tune the open-source VLM, InternVL2. The fine-tuned model achieves strong performance on both standard and long-context multimodal tasks. Notably, when the sequence length of the training dataset is increased to 256K tokens, the model is capable of processing multimodal sequences up to 1M tokens, highlighting its potential for real-world long-context applications.</description>

      <title>EasyRef: Omni-Generalized Group Image Reference for Diffusion Models via Multimodal LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant achievements in personalization of diffusion models have been witnessed. Conventional tuning-free methods mostly encode multiple reference images by averaging their image embeddings as the injection condition, but such an image-independent operation cannot perform interaction among images to capture consistent visual elements within multiple references. Although the tuning-based Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can effectively extract consistent elements within multiple images through the training process, it necessitates specific finetuning for each distinct image group. This paper introduces EasyRef, a novel plug-and-play adaptation method that enables diffusion models to be conditioned on multiple reference images and the text prompt. To effectively exploit consistent visual elements within multiple images, we leverage the multi-image comprehension and instruction-following capabilities of the multimodal large language model (MLLM), prompting it to capture consistent visual elements based on the instruction. Besides, injecting the MLLM's representations into the diffusion process through adapters can easily generalize to unseen domains, mining the consistent visual elements within unseen data. To mitigate computational costs and enhance fine-grained detail preservation, we introduce an efficient reference aggregation strategy and a progressive training scheme. Finally, we introduce MRBench, a new multi-reference image generation benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate EasyRef surpasses both tuning-free methods like IP-Adapter and tuning-based methods like LoRA, achieving superior aesthetic quality and robust zero-shot generalization across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>SnapGen: Taming High-Resolution Text-to-Image Models for Mobile Devices with Efficient Architectures and Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models face several limitations, including large model sizes, slow runtime, and low-quality generation on mobile devices. This paper aims to address all of these challenges by developing an extremely small and fast T2I model that generates high-resolution and high-quality images on mobile platforms. We propose several techniques to achieve this goal. First, we systematically examine the design choices of the network architecture to reduce model parameters and latency, while ensuring high-quality generation. Second, to further improve generation quality, we employ cross-architecture knowledge distillation from a much larger model, using a multi-level approach to guide the training of our model from scratch. Third, we enable a few-step generation by integrating adversarial guidance with knowledge distillation. For the first time, our model SnapGen, demonstrates the generation of 1024x1024 px images on a mobile device around 1.4 seconds. On ImageNet-1K, our model, with only 372M parameters, achieves an FID of 2.06 for 256x256 px generation. On T2I benchmarks (i.e., GenEval and DPG-Bench), our model with merely 379M parameters, surpasses large-scale models with billions of parameters at a significantly smaller size (e.g., 7x smaller than SDXL, 14x smaller than IF-XL).</description>

      <title>Learning Camera Movement Control from Real-World Drone Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study seeks to automate camera movement control for filming existing subjects into attractive videos, contrasting with the creation of non-existent content by directly generating the pixels. We select drone videos as our test case due to their rich and challenging motion patterns, distinctive viewing angles, and precise controls. Existing AI videography methods struggle with limited appearance diversity in simulation training, high costs of recording expert operations, and difficulties in designing heuristic-based goals to cover all scenarios. To avoid these issues, we propose a scalable method that involves collecting real-world training data to improve diversity, extracting camera trajectories automatically to minimize annotation costs, and training an effective architecture that does not rely on heuristics. Specifically, we collect 99k high-quality trajectories by running 3D reconstruction on online videos, connecting camera poses from consecutive frames to formulate 3D camera paths, and using Kalman filter to identify and remove low-quality data. Moreover, we introduce DVGFormer, an auto-regressive transformer that leverages the camera path and images from all past frames to predict camera movement in the next frame. We evaluate our system across 38 synthetic natural scenes and 7 real city 3D scans. We show that our system effectively learns to perform challenging camera movements such as navigating through obstacles, maintaining low altitude to increase perceived speed, and orbiting towers and buildings, which are very useful for recording high-quality videos.

      <title>Stereo4D: Learning How Things Move in 3D from Internet Stereo Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning to understand dynamic 3D scenes from imagery is crucial for applications ranging from robotics to scene reconstruction. Yet, unlike other problems where large-scale supervised training has enabled rapid progress, directly supervising methods for recovering 3D motion remains challenging due to the fundamental difficulty of obtaining ground truth annotations. We present a system for mining high-quality 4D reconstructions from internet stereoscopic, wide-angle videos. Our system fuses and filters the outputs of camera pose estimation, stereo depth estimation, and temporal tracking methods into high-quality dynamic 3D reconstructions. We use this method to generate large-scale data in the form of world-consistent, pseudo-metric 3D point clouds with long-term motion trajectories. We demonstrate the utility of this data by training a variant of DUSt3R to predict structure and 3D motion from real-world image pairs, showing that training on our reconstructed data enables generalization to diverse real-world scenes.

      <title>LoRACLR: Contrastive Adaptation for Customization of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image customization have enabled high-fidelity, context-rich generation of personalized images, allowing specific concepts to appear in a variety of scenarios. However, current methods struggle with combining multiple personalized models, often leading to attribute entanglement or requiring separate training to preserve concept distinctiveness. We present LoRACLR, a novel approach for multi-concept image generation that merges multiple LoRA models, each fine-tuned for a distinct concept, into a single, unified model without additional individual fine-tuning. LoRACLR uses a contrastive objective to align and merge the weight spaces of these models, ensuring compatibility while minimizing interference. By enforcing distinct yet cohesive representations for each concept, LoRACLR enables efficient, scalable model composition for high-quality, multi-concept image synthesis. Our results highlight the effectiveness of LoRACLR in accurately merging multiple concepts, advancing the capabilities of personalized image generation.</description>

      <title>OmniDrag: Enabling Motion Control for Omnidirectional Image-to-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As virtual reality gains popularity, the demand for controllable creation of immersive and dynamic omnidirectional videos (ODVs) is increasing. While previous text-to-ODV generation methods achieve impressive results, they struggle with content inaccuracies and inconsistencies due to reliance solely on textual inputs. Although recent motion control techniques provide fine-grained control for video generation, directly applying these methods to ODVs often results in spatial distortion and unsatisfactory performance, especially with complex spherical motions. To tackle these challenges, we propose OmniDrag, the first approach enabling both scene- and object-level motion control for accurate, high-quality omnidirectional image-to-video generation. Building on pretrained video diffusion models, we introduce an omnidirectional control module, which is jointly fine-tuned with temporal attention layers to effectively handle complex spherical motion. In addition, we develop a novel spherical motion estimator that accurately extracts motion-control signals and allows users to perform drag-style ODV generation by simply drawing handle and target points. We also present a new dataset, named Move360, addressing the scarcity of ODV data with large scene and object motions. Experiments demonstrate the significant superiority of OmniDrag in achieving holistic scene-level and fine-grained object-level control for ODV generation.

      <title>GenEx: Generating an Explorable World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding, navigating, and exploring the 3D physical real world has long been a central challenge in the development of artificial intelligence. In this work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine, our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous 360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices. In summary, we demonstrate that GenEx provides a transformative platform for advancing embodied AI in imaginative spaces and brings potential for extending these capabilities to real-world exploration.</description>

      <title>Illusion3D: 3D Multiview Illusion with 2D Diffusion Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatically generating multiview illusions is a compelling challenge, where a single piece of visual content offers distinct interpretations from different viewing perspectives. Traditional methods, such as shadow art and wire art, create interesting 3D illusions but are limited to simple visual outputs (i.e., figure-ground or line drawing), restricting their artistic expressiveness and practical versatility. Recent diffusion-based illusion generation methods can generate more intricate designs but are confined to 2D images. In this work, we present a simple yet effective approach for creating 3D multiview illusions based on user-provided text prompts or images. Our method leverages a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to optimize the textures and geometry of neural 3D representations through differentiable rendering. When viewed from multiple angles, this produces different interpretations. We develop several techniques to improve the quality of the generated 3D multiview illusions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and showcase illusion generation with diverse 3D forms.</description>

      <title>FreeScale: Unleashing the Resolution of Diffusion Models via Tuning-Free Scale Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the accumulated errors. To tackle this challenge, we propose FreeScale, a tuning-free inference paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation via scale fusion. Specifically, FreeScale processes information from different receptive scales and then fuses it by extracting desired frequency components. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models. Notably, compared with the previous best-performing method, FreeScale unlocks the generation of 8k-resolution images for the first time.</description>

      <title>Doe-1: Closed-Loop Autonomous Driving with Large World Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has received increasing attention due to its potential to learn from large amounts of data. However, most existing methods are still open-loop and suffer from weak scalability, lack of high-order interactions, and inefficient decision-making. In this paper, we explore a closed-loop framework for autonomous driving and propose a large Driving wOrld modEl (Doe-1) for unified perception, prediction, and planning. We formulate autonomous driving as a next-token generation problem and use multi-modal tokens to accomplish different tasks. Specifically, we use free-form texts (i.e., scene descriptions) for perception and generate future predictions directly in the RGB space with image tokens. For planning, we employ a position-aware tokenizer to effectively encode action into discrete tokens. We train a multi-modal transformer to autoregressively generate perception, prediction, and planning tokens in an end-to-end and unified manner. Experiments on the widely used nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of Doe-1 in various tasks including visual question-answering, action-conditioned video generation, and motion planning.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the interplay of visual and textual features in online discussions about cannabis edibles and their impact on user engagement. Leveraging the CLIP model, we analyzed 42,743 images from Facebook (March 1 to August 31, 2021), with a focus on detecting food-related visuals and examining the influence of image attributes such as colorfulness and brightness on user interaction. For textual analysis, we utilized the BART model as a denoising autoencoder to classify ten topics derived from structural topic modeling, exploring their relationship with user engagement. Linear regression analysis identified significant positive correlations between food-related visuals (e.g., fruit, candy, and bakery) and user engagement scores, as well as between engagement and text topics such as cannabis legalization. In contrast, negative associations were observed with image colorfulness and certain textual themes. These findings offer actionable insights for policymakers and regulatory bodies in designing warning labels and marketing regulations to address potential risks associated with recreational cannabis edibles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Major depressive disorder is a prevalent and serious mental health condition that negatively impacts your emotions, thoughts, actions, and overall perception of the world. It is complicated to determine whether a person is depressed due to the symptoms of depression not apparent. However, their voice can be one of the factor from which we can acknowledge signs of depression. People who are depressed express discomfort, sadness and they may speak slowly, trembly, and lose emotion in their voices. In this study, we proposed the Dynamic Convolutional Block Attention Module (Dynamic-CBAM) to utilized with in an Attention-GRU Network to classify the emotions by analyzing the audio signal of humans. Based on the results, we can diagnose which patients are depressed or prone to depression then so that treatment and prevention can be started as soon as possible. The research delves into the intricate computational steps involved in implementing a Attention-GRU deep learning architecture. Through experimentation, the model has achieved an impressive recognition with Unweighted Accuracy (UA) rate of 0.87 and 0.86 Weighted Accuracy (WA) rate and F1 rate of 0.87 in the VNEMOS dataset. Training code is released in https://github.com/fiyud/Emotional-Vietnamese-Speech-Based-Depression-Diagnosis-Using-Dynamic-Attention-Mechanism</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Framework for Statistical Feature Selection and Image-Based Noise-Defect Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In industrial imaging, accurately detecting and distinguishing surface defects from noise is critical and challenging, particularly in complex environments with noisy data. This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates both statistical feature selection and classification techniques to improve defect detection accuracy while minimizing false positives. The motivation of the system is based on the generation of scalar scores that represent the likelihood that a region of interest (ROI) is classified as a defect or noise. We present around 55 distinguished features that are extracted from industrial images, which are then analyzed using statistical methods such as Fisher separation, chi-squared test, and variance analysis. These techniques identify the most discriminative features, focusing on maximizing the separation between true defects and noise. Fisher's criterion ensures robust, real-time performance for automated systems. This statistical framework opens up multiple avenues for application, functioning as a standalone assessment module or as an a posteriori enhancement to machine learning classifiers. The framework can be implemented as a black-box module that applies to existing classifiers, providing an adaptable layer of quality control and optimizing predictions by leveraging intuitive feature extraction strategies, emphasizing the rationale behind feature significance and the statistical rigor of feature selection. By integrating these methods with flexible machine learning applications, the proposed framework improves detection accuracy and reduces false positives and misclassifications, especially in complex, noisy environments.</description>

      <title>jina-clip-v2: Multilingual Multimodal Embeddings for Text and Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a highly effective method for aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space. These models are widely used for tasks such as cross-modal information retrieval and multi-modal understanding. However, CLIP models often struggle with text-only tasks, underperforming compared to specialized text models. This performance disparity forces retrieval systems to rely on separate models for text-only and multi-modal tasks. In this work, we build upon our previous model, jina-clip-v1, by introducing a refined framework that utilizes multi-task, multi-stage contrastive learning across multiple languages, coupled with an improved training recipe to enhance text-only retrieval. The resulting model, jina-clip-v2, outperforms its predecessor on text-only and multimodal tasks, while adding multilingual support, better understanding of complex visual documents and efficiency gains thanks to Matryoshka Representation Learning and vector truncation. The model performs comparably to the state-of-the-art in both multilingual-multimodal and multilingual text retrieval benchmarks, addressing the challenge of unifying text-only and multi-modal retrieval systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Clustering using Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture and Alpha Jensen-Shannon Divergence Clustering Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep clustering is an emerging topic in deep learning where traditional clustering is performed in deep learning feature space. However, clustering and deep learning are often mutually exclusive. In the autoencoder based deep clustering, the challenge is how to jointly optimize both clustering and dimension reduction together, so that the weights in the hidden layers are not only guided by reconstruction loss, but also by a loss function associated with clustering. The current state-of-the-art has two fundamental flaws. First, they rely on the mathematical convenience of Kullback-Leibler divergence for the clustering loss function but the former is asymmetric. Secondly, they assume the prior knowledge on the number of clusters is always available for their dataset of interest. This paper tries to improve on these problems. In the first problem, we use a Jensen-Shannon divergence to overcome the asymmetric issue, specifically using a closed form variant. Next, we introduce an infinite cluster representation using Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model for joint clustering and model selection in the latent space which we called deep model selection. The number of clusters in the latent space are not fixed but instead vary accordingly as they gradually approach the optimal number during training. Thus, prior knowledge is not required. We evaluate our proposed deep model selection method with traditional model selection on large class number datasets such as MIT67 and CIFAR100 and also compare with both traditional variational Bayes model and deep clustering method with convincing results.</description>

      <title>Optimized Gradient Clipping for Noisy Label Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous research has shown that constraining the gradient of loss function with respect to model-predicted probabilities can enhance the model robustness against noisy labels. These methods typically specify a fixed optimal threshold for gradient clipping through validation data to obtain the desired robustness against noise. However, this common practice overlooks the dynamic distribution of gradients from both clean and noisy-labeled samples at different stages of training, significantly limiting the model capability to adapt to the variable nature of gradients throughout the training process. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach called Optimized Gradient Clipping (OGC), which dynamically adjusts the clipping threshold based on the ratio of noise gradients to clean gradients after clipping, estimated by modeling the distributions of clean and noisy samples. This approach allows us to modify the clipping threshold at each training step, effectively controlling the influence of noise gradients. Additionally, we provide statistical analysis to certify the noise-tolerance ability of OGC. Our extensive experiments across various types of label noise, including symmetric, asymmetric, instance-dependent, and real-world noise, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The code and a technical appendix for better digital viewing are included as supplementary materials and scheduled to be open-sourced upon publication.</description>

      <title>A Wander Through the Multimodal Landscape: Efficient Transfer Learning via Low-rank Sequence Multimodal Adapter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient transfer learning methods such as adapter-based methods have shown great success in unimodal models and vision-language models. However, existing methods have two main challenges in fine-tuning multimodal models. Firstly, they are designed for vision-language tasks and fail to extend to situations where there are more than two modalities. Secondly, they exhibit limited exploitation of interactions between modalities and lack efficiency. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose the loW-rank sequence multimodal adapter (Wander). We first use the outer product to fuse the information from different modalities in an element-wise way effectively. For efficiency, we use CP decomposition to factorize tensors into rank-one components and achieve substantial parameter reduction. Furthermore, we implement a token-level low-rank decomposition to extract more fine-grained features and sequence relationships between modalities. With these designs, Wander enables token-level interactions between sequences of different modalities in a parameter-efficient way. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets with different numbers of modalities, where Wander outperforms state-of-the-art efficient transfer learning methods consistently. The results fully demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and universality of Wander.</description>

      <title>Vision CNNs trained to estimate spatial latents learned similar ventral-stream-aligned representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of the functional role of the primate ventral visual stream have traditionally focused on object categorization, often ignoring -- despite much prior evidence -- its role in estimating "spatial" latents such as object position and pose. Most leading ventral stream models are derived by optimizing networks for object categorization, which seems to imply that the ventral stream is also derived under such an objective. Here, we explore an alternative hypothesis: Might the ventral stream be optimized for estimating spatial latents? And a closely related question: How different -- if at all -- are representations learned from spatial latent estimation compared to categorization? To ask these questions, we leveraged synthetic image datasets generated by a 3D graphic engine and trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to estimate different combinations of spatial and category latents. We found that models trained to estimate just a few spatial latents achieve neural alignment scores comparable to those trained on hundreds of categories, and the spatial latent performance of models strongly correlates with their neural alignment. Spatial latent and category-trained models have very similar -- but not identical -- internal representations, especially in their early and middle layers. We provide evidence that this convergence is partly driven by non-target latent variability in the training data, which facilitates the implicit learning of representations of those non-target latents. Taken together, these results suggest that many training objectives, such as spatial latents, can lead to similar models aligned neurally with the ventral stream. Thus, one should not assume that the ventral stream is optimized for object categorization only. As a field, we need to continue to sharpen our measures of comparing models to brains to better understand the functional roles of the ventral stream.</description>

      <title>YingSound: Video-Guided Sound Effects Generation with Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating sound effects for product-level videos, where only a small amount of labeled data is available for diverse scenes, requires the production of high-quality sounds in few-shot settings. To tackle the challenge of limited labeled data in real-world scenes, we introduce YingSound, a foundation model designed for video-guided sound generation that supports high-quality audio generation in few-shot settings. Specifically, YingSound consists of two major modules. The first module uses a conditional flow matching transformer to achieve effective semantic alignment in sound generation across audio and visual modalities. This module aims to build a learnable audio-visual aggregator (AVA) that integrates high-resolution visual features with corresponding audio features at multiple stages. The second module is developed with a proposed multi-modal visual-audio chain-of-thought (CoT) approach to generate finer sound effects in few-shot settings. Finally, an industry-standard video-to-audio (V2A) dataset that encompasses various real-world scenarios is presented. We show that YingSound effectively generates high-quality synchronized sounds across diverse conditional inputs through automated evaluations and human studies.

      <title>Multimodal Sentiment Analysis based on Video and Audio Inputs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the abundance of current researches working on the sentiment analysis from videos and audios, finding the best model that gives the highest accuracy rate is still considered a challenge for researchers in this field. The main objective of this paper is to prove the usability of emotion recognition models that take video and audio inputs. The datasets used to train the models are the CREMA-D dataset for audio and the RAVDESS dataset for video. The fine-tuned models that been used are: Facebook/wav2vec2-large for audio and the Google/vivit-b-16x2-kinetics400 for video. The avarage of the probabilities for each emotion generated by the two previous models is utilized in the decision making framework. After disparity in the results, if one of the models gets much higher accuracy, another test framework is created. The methods used are the Weighted Average method, the Confidence Level Threshold method, the Dynamic Weighting Based on Confidence method, and the Rule-Based Logic method. This limited approach gives encouraging results that make future research into these methods viable.</description>

      <title>Computer-Aided Osteoporosis Diagnosis Using Transfer Learning with Enhanced Features from Stacked Deep Learning Modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knee osteoporosis weakens the bone tissue in the knee joint, increasing fracture risk. Early detection through X-ray images enables timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. While some researchers have focused on diagnosing knee osteoporosis through manual radiology evaluation and traditional machine learning using hand-crafted features, these methods often struggle with performance and efficiency due to reliance on manual feature extraction and subjective interpretation. In this study, we propose a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for knee osteoporosis, combining transfer learning with stacked feature enhancement deep learning blocks. Initially, knee X-ray images are preprocessed, and features are extracted using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). These features are then enhanced through five sequential Conv-RELU-MaxPooling blocks. The Conv2D layers detect low-level features, while the ReLU activations introduce non-linearity, allowing the network to learn complex patterns. MaxPooling layers down-sample the features, retaining the most important spatial information. This sequential processing enables the model to capture complex, high-level features related to bone structure, joint deformation, and osteoporotic markers. The enhanced features are passed through a classification module to differentiate between healthy and osteoporotic knee conditions. Extensive experiments on three individual datasets and a combined dataset demonstrate that our model achieves 97.32%, 98.24%, 97.27%, and 98.00% accuracy for OKX Kaggle Binary, KXO-Mendeley Multi-Class, OKX Kaggle Multi-Class, and the combined dataset, respectively, showing an improvement of around 2% over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Physics-Driven Autoregressive State Space Models for Medical Image Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical image reconstruction from undersampled acquisitions is an ill-posed problem that involves inversion of the imaging operator linking measurement and image domains. In recent years, physics-driven (PD) models have gained prominence in learning-based reconstruction given their enhanced balance between efficiency and performance. For reconstruction, PD models cascade data-consistency modules that enforce fidelity to acquired data based on the imaging operator, with network modules that process feature maps to alleviate image artifacts due to undersampling. Success in artifact suppression inevitably depends on the ability of the network modules to tease apart artifacts from underlying tissue structures, both of which can manifest contextual relations over broad spatial scales. Convolutional modules that excel at capturing local correlations are relatively insensitive to non-local context. While transformers promise elevated sensitivity to non-local context, practical implementations often suffer from a suboptimal trade-off between local and non-local sensitivity due to intrinsic model complexity. Here, we introduce a novel physics-driven autoregressive state space model (MambaRoll) for enhanced fidelity in medical image reconstruction. In each cascade of an unrolled architecture, MambaRoll employs an autoregressive framework based on physics-driven state space modules (PSSM), where PSSMs efficiently aggregate contextual features at a given spatial scale while maintaining fidelity to acquired data, and autoregressive prediction of next-scale feature maps from earlier spatial scales enhance capture of multi-scale contextual features. Demonstrations on accelerated MRI and sparse-view CT reconstructions indicate that MambaRoll outperforms state-of-the-art PD methods based on convolutional, transformer and conventional SSM modules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time Series Motif Discovery (TSMD), which aims at finding recurring patterns in time series, is an important task in numerous application domains, and many methods for this task exist. These methods are usually evaluated qualitatively. A few metrics for quantitative evaluation, where discovered motifs are compared to some ground truth, have been proposed, but they typically make implicit assumptions that limit their applicability. This paper introduces PROM, a broadly applicable metric that overcomes those limitations, and TSMD-Bench, a benchmark for quantitative evaluation of time series motif discovery. Experiments with PROM and TSMD-Bench show that PROM provides a more comprehensive evaluation than existing metrics, that TSMD-Bench is a more challenging benchmark than earlier ones, and that the combination can help understand the relative performance of TSMD methods. More generally, the proposed approach enables large-scale, systematic performance comparisons in this field.</description>

Abstract: The segmentation and classification of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging are critical for diagnosing heart conditions, yet current approaches face challenges in accuracy and generalizability. In this study, we aim to further advance the segmentation and classification of cardiac magnetic resonance images by introducing a novel deep learning-based approach. Using a multi-stage process with U-Net and ResNet models for segmentation, followed by Gaussian smoothing, the method improved segmentation accuracy, achieving a Dice coefficient of 0.974 for the left ventricle and 0.947 for the right ventricle. For classification, a cascade of deep learning classifiers was employed to distinguish heart conditions, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, and dilated cardiomyopathy, achieving an average accuracy of 97.2%. The proposed approach outperformed existing models, enhancing segmentation accuracy and classification precision. These advancements show promise for clinical applications, though further validation and interpretation across diverse imaging protocols is necessary.</description>

      <title>Learned Compression for Compressed Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern sensors produce increasingly rich streams of high-resolution data. Due to resource constraints, machine learning systems discard the vast majority of this information via resolution reduction. Compressed-domain learning allows models to operate on compact latent representations, allowing higher effective resolution for the same budget. However, existing compression systems are not ideal for compressed learning. Linear transform coding and end-to-end learned compression systems reduce bitrate, but do not uniformly reduce dimensionality; thus, they do not meaningfully increase efficiency. Generative autoencoders reduce dimensionality, but their adversarial or perceptual objectives lead to significant information loss. To address these limitations, we introduce WaLLoC (Wavelet Learned Lossy Compression), a neural codec architecture that combines linear transform coding with nonlinear dimensionality-reducing autoencoders. WaLLoC sandwiches a shallow, asymmetric autoencoder and entropy bottleneck between an invertible wavelet packet transform. Across several key metrics, WaLLoC outperforms the autoencoders used in state-of-the-art latent diffusion models. WaLLoC does not require perceptual or adversarial losses to represent high-frequency detail, providing compatibility with modalities beyond RGB images and stereo audio. WaLLoC's encoder consists almost entirely of linear operations, making it exceptionally efficient and suitable for mobile computing, remote sensing, and learning directly from compressed data. We demonstrate WaLLoC's capability for compressed-domain learning across several tasks, including image classification, colorization, document understanding, and music source separation.

      <title>A Plug-and-Play Algorithm for 3D Video Super-Resolution of Single-Photon LiDAR data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are advanced sensors capable of detecting individual photons and recording their arrival times with picosecond resolution using time-correlated Single-Photon Counting detection techniques. They are used in various applications, such as LiDAR, and can capture high-speed sequences of binary single-photon images, offering great potential for reconstructing 3D environments with high motion dynamics. To complement single-photon data, they are often paired with conventional passive cameras, which capture high-resolution (HR) intensity images at a lower frame rate. However, 3D reconstruction from SPAD data faces challenges. Aggregating multiple binary measurements improves precision and reduces noise but can cause motion blur in dynamic scenes. Additionally, SPAD arrays often have lower resolution than passive cameras. To address these issues, we propose a novel computational imaging algorithm to improve the 3D reconstruction of moving scenes from SPAD data by addressing the motion blur and increasing the native spatial resolution. We adopt a plug-and-play approach within an optimization scheme alternating between guided video super-resolution of the 3D scene, and precise image realignment using optical flow. Experiments on synthetic data show significantly improved image resolutions across various signal-to-noise ratios and photon levels. We validate our method using real-world SPAD measurements on three practical situations with dynamic objects. First on fast-moving scenes in laboratory conditions at short range; second very low resolution imaging of people with a consumer-grade SPAD sensor from STMicroelectronics; and finally, HR imaging of people walking outdoors in daylight at a range of 325 meters under eye-safe illumination conditions using a short-wave infrared SPAD camera. These results demonstrate the robustness and versatility of our approach.</description>

      <title>MOS: Model Surgery for Pre-Trained Model-Based Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continually acquire knowledge of new classes without forgetting old ones. Despite Pre-trained Models (PTMs) have shown excellent performance in CIL, catastrophic forgetting still occurs as the model learns new concepts. Existing work seeks to utilize lightweight components to adjust the PTM, while the forgetting phenomenon still comes from {\em parameter and retrieval} levels. Specifically, iterative updates of the model result in parameter drift, while mistakenly retrieving irrelevant modules leads to the mismatch during inference. To this end, we propose MOdel Surgery (MOS) to rescue the model from forgetting previous knowledge. By training task-specific adapters, we continually adjust the PTM to downstream tasks. To mitigate parameter-level forgetting, we present an adapter merging approach to learn task-specific adapters, which aims to bridge the gap between different components while reserve task-specific information. Besides, to address retrieval-level forgetting, we introduce a training-free self-refined adapter retrieval mechanism during inference, which leverages the model's inherent ability for better adapter retrieval. By jointly rectifying the model with those steps, MOS can robustly resist catastrophic forgetting in the learning process. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets validate MOS's state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at: https://github.com/sun-hailong/AAAI25-MOS</description>

      <title>Embeddings are all you need! Achieving High Performance Medical Image Classification through Training-Free Embedding Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models for medical imaging typically involves extensive training and testing on large datasets, consuming significant computational time, energy, and resources. There is a need for more efficient methods that can achieve comparable or superior diagnostic performance without the associated resource burden. We investigated the feasibility of replacing conventional training procedures with an embedding-based approach that leverages concise and semantically meaningful representations of medical images. Using pre-trained foundational models-specifically, convolutional neural networks (CNN) like ResNet and multimodal models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-we generated image embeddings for multi-class classification tasks. Simple linear classifiers were then applied to these embeddings. The approach was evaluated across diverse medical imaging modalities, including retinal images, mammography, dermatoscopic images, and chest radiographs. Performance was compared to benchmark models trained and tested using traditional methods. The embedding-based models surpassed the benchmark area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) scores by up to 87 percentage in multi-class classification tasks across the various medical imaging modalities. Notably, CLIP embedding models achieved the highest AUC-ROC scores, demonstrating superior classification performance while significantly reducing computational demands. Our study indicates that leveraging embeddings from pre-trained foundational models can effectively replace conventional, resource-intensive training and testing procedures in medical image analysis. This embedding-based approach offers a more efficient alternative for image segmentation, classification, and prediction, potentially accelerating AI technology integration into clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Video Seal: Open and Efficient Video Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated content and sophisticated video editing tools has made it both important and challenging to moderate digital platforms. Video watermarking addresses these challenges by embedding imperceptible signals into videos, allowing for identification. However, the rare open tools and methods often fall short on efficiency, robustness, and flexibility. To reduce these gaps, this paper introduces Video Seal, a comprehensive framework for neural video watermarking and a competitive open-sourced model. Our approach jointly trains an embedder and an extractor, while ensuring the watermark robustness by applying transformations in-between, e.g., video codecs. This training is multistage and includes image pre-training, hybrid post-training and extractor fine-tuning. We also introduce temporal watermark propagation, a technique to convert any image watermarking model to an efficient video watermarking model without the need to watermark every high-resolution frame. We present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in terms of speed, imperceptibility, and robustness. Video Seal achieves higher robustness compared to strong baselines especially under challenging distortions combining geometric transformations and video compression. Additionally, we provide new insights such as the impact of video compression during training, and how to compare methods operating on different payloads. Contributions in this work - including the codebase, models, and a public demo - are open-sourced under permissive licenses to foster further research and development in the field.</description>

      <title>Meshtron: High-Fidelity, Artist-Like 3D Mesh Generation at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meshes are fundamental representations of 3D surfaces. However, creating high-quality meshes is a labor-intensive task that requires significant time and expertise in 3D modeling. While a delicate object often requires over $10^4$ faces to be accurately modeled, recent attempts at generating artist-like meshes are limited to $1.6$K faces and heavy discretization of vertex coordinates. Hence, scaling both the maximum face count and vertex coordinate resolution is crucial to producing high-quality meshes of realistic, complex 3D objects. We present Meshtron, a novel autoregressive mesh generation model able to generate meshes with up to 64K faces at 1024-level coordinate resolution --over an order of magnitude higher face count and $8{\times}$ higher coordinate resolution than current state-of-the-art methods. Meshtron's scalability is driven by four key components: (1) an hourglass neural architecture, (2) truncated sequence training, (3) sliding window inference, (4) a robust sampling strategy that enforces the order of mesh sequences. This results in over $50{\%}$ less training memory, $2.5{\times}$ faster throughput, and better consistency than existing works. Meshtron generates meshes of detailed, complex 3D objects at unprecedented levels of resolution and fidelity, closely resembling those created by professional artists, and opening the door to more realistic generation of detailed 3D assets for animation, gaming, and virtual environments.</description>

      <title>Neptune: The Long Orbit to Benchmarking Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes a semi-automatic pipeline to generate challenging question-answer-decoy sets for understanding long videos. Many existing video datasets and models are focused on short clips (10s-30s). While some long video datasets do exist, they can often be solved by powerful image models applied per frame (and often to very few frames) in a video, and are usually manually annotated at high cost. In order to mitigate both these problems, we propose a scalable dataset creation pipeline which leverages large models (VLMs and LLMs), to automatically generate dense, time-aligned video captions, as well as tough question answer decoy sets for video segments (up to 15 minutes in length). Our dataset Neptune covers a broad range of long video reasoning abilities and consists of a subset that emphasizes multimodal reasoning. Since existing metrics for open-ended question answering are either rule-based or may rely on proprietary models, we provide a new open source model-based metric GEM to score open-ended responses on Neptune. Benchmark evaluations reveal that most current open-source long video models perform poorly on Neptune, particularly on questions testing temporal ordering, counting and state changes. Through Neptune, we aim to spur the development of more advanced models capable of understanding long videos. The dataset is available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune</description>

      <title>Improving generative adversarial network inversion via fine-tuning GAN encoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.10201v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can synthesize high-quality (HQ) images, and GAN inversion is a technique that discovers how to invert given images back to latent space. While existing methods perform on StyleGAN inversion, they have limited performance and are not generalized to different GANs. To address these issues, we proposed a self-supervised method to pre-train and fine-tune GAN encoders. First, we designed an adaptive block to fit different encoder architectures for inverting diverse GANs. Then we pre-train GAN encoders using synthesized images and emphasize local regions through cropping images. Finally, we fine-tune the pre-trained GAN encoder for inverting real images. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method achieved better results that reconstructed high-quality images on mainstream GANs. Our code and pre-trained models are available at: https://github.com/disanda/Deep-GAN-Encoders.</description>

      <title>ELBA: Learning by Asking for Embodied Visual Navigation and Task Completion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The research community has shown increasing interest in designing intelligent embodied agents that can assist humans in accomplishing tasks. Although there have been significant advancements in related vision-language benchmarks, most prior work has focused on building agents that follow instructions rather than endowing agents the ability to ask questions to actively resolve ambiguities arising naturally in embodied environments. To address this gap, we propose an Embodied Learning-By-Asking (ELBA) model that learns when and what questions to ask to dynamically acquire additional information for completing the task. We evaluate ELBA on the TEACh vision-dialog navigation and task completion dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves improved task performance compared to baseline models without question-answering capabilities.</description>

      <title>CoDeF: Content Deformation Fields for Temporally Consistent Video Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the content deformation field CoDeF as a new type of video representation, which consists of a canonical content field aggregating the static contents in the entire video and a temporal deformation field recording the transformations from the canonical image (i.e., rendered from the canonical content field) to each individual frame along the time axis. Given a target video, these two fields are jointly optimized to reconstruct it through a carefully tailored rendering pipeline. We advisedly introduce some regularizations into the optimization process, urging the canonical content field to inherit semantics (e.g., the object shape) from the video. With such a design, CoDeF naturally supports lifting image algorithms for video processing, in the sense that one can apply an image algorithm to the canonical image and effortlessly propagate the outcomes to the entire video with the aid of the temporal deformation field. We experimentally show that CoDeF is able to lift image-to-image translation to video-to-video translation and lift keypoint detection to keypoint tracking without any training. More importantly, thanks to our lifting strategy that deploys the algorithms on only one image, we achieve superior cross-frame consistency in processed videos compared to existing video-to-video translation approaches, and even manage to track non-rigid objects like water and smog.

      <description>arXiv:2401.07450v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fashion design is a challenging and complex process.Recent works on fashion generation and editing are all agnostic of the actual fashion design process, which limits their usage in practice.In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical diffusion-based framework tailored for fashion design, coined as HieraFashDiff. Our model is designed to mimic the practical fashion design workflow, by unraveling the denosing process into two successive stages: 1) an ideation stage that generates design proposals given high-level concepts and 2) an iteration stage that continuously refines the proposals using low-level attributes. Our model supports fashion design generation and fine-grained local editing in a single framework. To train our model, we contribute a new dataset of full-body fashion images annotated with hierarchical text descriptions. Extensive evaluations show that, as compared to prior approaches, our method can generate fashion designs and edited results with higher fidelity and better prompt adherence, showing its promising potential to augment the practical fashion design workflow. Code and Dataset are available at https://github.com/haoli-zbdbc/hierafashdiff.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The truthfulness of existing explanation methods in authentically elucidating the underlying model's decision-making process has been questioned. Existing methods have deviated from faithfully representing the model, thus susceptible to adversarial attacks. To address this, we propose a novel eXplainable AI (XAI) method called SRD (Sharing Ratio Decomposition), which sincerely reflects the model's inference process, resulting in significantly enhanced robustness in our explanations. Different from the conventional emphasis on the neuronal level, we adopt a vector perspective to consider the intricate nonlinear interactions between filters. We also introduce an interesting observation termed Activation-Pattern-Only Prediction (APOP), letting us emphasize the importance of inactive neurons and redefine relevance encapsulating all relevant information including both active and inactive neurons. Our method, SRD, allows for the recursive decomposition of a Pointwise Feature Vector (PFV), providing a high-resolution Effective Receptive Field (ERF) at any layer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11940v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning research have shown remarkable achievements across many tasks in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). At the intersection of CV and NLP is the problem of image captioning, where the related models' robustness against adversarial attacks has not been well studied. This paper presents a novel adversarial attack strategy, AICAttack (Attention-based Image Captioning Attack), designed to attack image captioning models through subtle perturbations on images. Operating within a black-box attack scenario, our algorithm requires no access to the target model's architecture, parameters, or gradient information. We introduce an attention-based candidate selection mechanism that identifies the optimal pixels to attack, followed by a customised differential evolution method to optimise the perturbations of pixels' RGB values. We demonstrate AICAttack's effectiveness through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets against multiple victim models. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms current leading-edge techniques by achieving consistently higher attack success rates.</description>

      <title>Direct Consistency Optimization for Robust Customization of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, when fine-tuned on a few personal images, can generate visuals with a high degree of consistency. However, such fine-tuned models are not robust; they often fail to compose with concepts of pretrained model or other fine-tuned models. To address this, we propose a novel fine-tuning objective, dubbed Direct Consistency Optimization, which controls the deviation between fine-tuning and pretrained models to retain the pretrained knowledge during fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments on subject and style customization, we demonstrate that our method positions itself on a superior Pareto frontier between subject (or style) consistency and image-text alignment over all previous baselines; it not only outperforms regular fine-tuning objective in image-text alignment, but also shows higher fidelity to the reference images than the method that fine-tunes with additional prior dataset. More importantly, the models fine-tuned with our method can be merged without interference, allowing us to generate custom subjects in a custom style by composing separately customized subject and style models. Notably, we show that our approach achieves better prompt fidelity and subject fidelity than those post-optimized for merging regular fine-tuned models.</description>

Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach to neural rendering, specifically tailored for adversarial camouflage, within an extensive 3D rendering framework. Our method, named FPA, goes beyond traditional techniques by faithfully simulating lighting conditions and material variations, ensuring a nuanced and realistic representation of textures on a 3D target. To achieve this, we employ a generative approach that learns adversarial patterns from a diffusion model. This involves incorporating a specially designed adversarial loss and covert constraint loss to guarantee the adversarial and covert nature of the camouflage in the physical world. Furthermore, we showcase the effectiveness of the proposed camouflage in sticker mode, demonstrating its ability to cover the target without compromising adversarial information. Through empirical and physical experiments, FPA exhibits strong performance in terms of attack success rate and transferability. Additionally, the designed sticker-mode camouflage, coupled with a concealment constraint, adapts to the environment, yielding diverse styles of texture. Our findings highlight the versatility and efficacy of the FPA approach in adversarial camouflage applications.</description>

      <title>Attention-based Class-Conditioned Alignment for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation of Object Detectors</title>

Abstract: Domain adaptation methods for object detection (OD) strive to mitigate the impact of distribution shifts by promoting feature alignment across source and target domains. Multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) allows leveraging multiple annotated source datasets and unlabeled target data to improve the accuracy and robustness of the detection model. Most state-of-the-art MSDA methods for OD perform feature alignment in a class-agnostic manner. This is challenging since the objects have unique modality information due to variations in object appearance across domains. A recent prototype-based approach proposed a class-wise alignment, yet it suffers from error accumulation caused by noisy pseudo-labels that can negatively affect adaptation with imbalanced data. To overcome these limitations, we propose an attention-based class-conditioned alignment method for MSDA, designed to align instances of each object category across domains. In particular, an attention module combined with an adversarial domain classifier allows learning domain-invariant and class-specific instance representations. Experimental results on multiple benchmarking MSDA datasets indicate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits robustness to class imbalance, achieved through a conceptually simple class-conditioning strategy.

      <title>QueSTMaps: Queryable Semantic Topological Maps for 3D Scene Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic tasks such as planning and navigation require a hierarchical semantic understanding of a scene, which could include multiple floors and rooms. Current methods primarily focus on object segmentation for 3D scene understanding. However, such methods struggle to segment out topological regions like "kitchen" in the scene. In this work, we introduce a two-step pipeline to solve this problem. First, we extract a topological map, i.e., floorplan of the indoor scene using a novel multi-channel occupancy representation. Then, we generate CLIP-aligned features and semantic labels for every room instance based on the objects it contains using a self-attention transformer. Our language-topology alignment supports natural language querying, e.g., a "place to cook" locates the "kitchen". We outperform the current state-of-the-art on room segmentation by ~20% and room classification by ~12%. Our detailed qualitative analysis and ablation studies provide insights into the problem of joint structural and semantic 3D scene understanding. Project Page: quest-maps.github.io</description>

      <title>TextCenGen: Attention-Guided Text-Centric Background Adaptation for Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11824v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-image (T2I) generation have witnessed a shift from adapting text to fixed backgrounds to creating images around text. Traditional approaches are often limited to generate layouts within static images for effective text placement. Our proposed approach, TextCenGen, introduces a dynamic adaptation of the blank region for text-friendly image generation, emphasizing text-centric design and visual harmony generation. Our method employs force-directed attention guidance in T2I models to generate images that strategically reserve whitespace for pre-defined text areas, even for text or icons at the golden ratio. Observing how cross-attention maps affect object placement, we detect and repel conflicting objects using a force-directed graph approach, combined with a Spatial Excluding Cross-Attention Constraint for smooth attention in whitespace areas. As a novel task in graphic design, experiments indicate that TextCenGen outperforms existing methods with more harmonious compositions. Furthermore, our method significantly enhances T2I model outcomes on our specially collected prompt datasets, catering to varied text positions. These results demonstrate the efficacy of TextCenGen in creating more harmonious and integrated text-image compositions.</description>

      <title>Swin2-MoSE: A New Single Image Super-Resolution Model for Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the limitations of current optical and sensor technologies and the high cost of updating them, the spectral and spatial resolution of satellites may not always meet desired requirements. For these reasons, Remote-Sensing Single-Image Super-Resolution (RS-SISR) techniques have gained significant interest. In this paper, we propose Swin2-MoSE model, an enhanced version of Swin2SR. Our model introduces MoE-SM, an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to replace the Feed-Forward inside all Transformer block. MoE-SM is designed with Smart-Merger, and new layer for merging the output of individual experts, and with a new way to split the work between experts, defining a new per-example strategy instead of the commonly used per-token one. Furthermore, we analyze how positional encodings interact with each other, demonstrating that per-channel bias and per-head bias can positively cooperate. Finally, we propose to use a combination of Normalized-Cross-Correlation (NCC) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) losses, to avoid typical MSE loss limitations. Experimental results demonstrate that Swin2-MoSE outperforms any Swin derived models by up to 0.377 - 0.958 dB (PSNR) on task of 2x, 3x and 4x resolution-upscaling (Sen2Venus and OLI2MSI datasets). It also outperforms SOTA models by a good margin, proving to be competitive and with excellent potential, especially for complex tasks. Additionally, an analysis of computational costs is also performed. Finally, we show the efficacy of Swin2-MoSE, applying it to a semantic segmentation task (SeasoNet dataset).

      <title>Leveraging Medical Foundation Model Features in Graph Neural Network-Based Retrieval of Breast Histopathology Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Breast cancer is the most common cancer type in women worldwide. Early detection and appropriate treatment can significantly reduce its impact. While histopathology examinations play a vital role in rapid and accurate diagnosis, they often require experienced medical experts for proper recognition and cancer grading. Automated image retrieval systems have the potential to assist pathologists in identifying cancerous tissues, thereby accelerating the diagnostic process. Nevertheless, proposing an accurate image retrieval model is challenging due to considerable variability among the tissue and cell patterns in histological images. In this work, we leverage the features from foundation models in a novel attention-based adversarially regularized variational graph autoencoder model for breast histological image retrieval. Our results confirm the superior performance of models trained with foundation model features compared to those using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (up to 7.7% and 15.5% for mAP and mMV, respectively), with the pre-trained general-purpose self-supervised model for computational pathology (UNI) delivering the best overall performance. By evaluating two publicly available histology image datasets of breast cancer, our top-performing model, trained with UNI features, achieved average mAP/mMV scores of 96.7%/91.5% and 97.6%/94.2% for the BreakHis and BACH datasets, respectively. Our proposed retrieval model has the potential to be used in clinical settings to enhance diagnostic performance and ultimately benefit patients.</description>

      <title>GSDeformer: Direct, Real-time and Extensible Cage-based Deformation for 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present GSDeformer, a method that achieves cage-based deformation on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our method bridges cage-based deformation and 3DGS using a proxy point cloud representation. The point cloud is created from 3DGS, and deformations on the point cloud translate to transformations on the 3D Gaussians that comprise 3DGS. To handle potential bending from deformation, we employ a splitting process to approximate it. Our method does not extend or modify the core architecture of 3DGS; thus, it can work with any existing trained vanilla 3DGS as well as its variants. We also automated cage construction from 3DGS for convenience. Experiments show that GSDeformer produces superior deformation results than current methods, is robust under extreme deformations, does not require retraining for editing, runs in real-time(60FPS), and can extend to other 3DGS variants.</description>

      <title>FastLGS: Speeding up Language Embedded Gaussians with Feature Grid Mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01916v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The semantically interactive radiance field has always been an appealing task for its potential to facilitate user-friendly and automated real-world 3D scene understanding applications. However, it is a challenging task to achieve high quality, efficiency and zero-shot ability at the same time with semantics in radiance fields. In this work, we present FastLGS, an approach that supports real-time open-vocabulary query within 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) under high resolution. We propose the semantic feature grid to save multi-view CLIP features which are extracted based on Segment Anything Model (SAM) masks, and map the grids to low dimensional features for semantic field training through 3DGS. Once trained, we can restore pixel-aligned CLIP embeddings through feature grids from rendered features for open-vocabulary queries. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods prove that FastLGS can achieve the first place performance concerning both speed and accuracy, where FastLGS is 98x faster than LERF and 4x faster than LangSplat. Meanwhile, experiments show that FastLGS is adaptive and compatible with many downstream tasks, such as 3D segmentation and 3D object inpainting, which can be easily applied to other 3D manipulation systems.</description>

      <title>LLAVIDAL: A Large LAnguage VIsion Model for Daily Activities of Living</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current Large Language Vision Models (LLVMs) trained on web videos perform well in general video understanding but struggle with fine-grained details, complex human-object interactions (HOI), and view-invariant representation learning essential for Activities of Daily Living (ADL). This limitation stems from a lack of specialized ADL video instruction-tuning datasets and insufficient modality integration to capture discriminative action representations. To address this, we propose a semi-automated framework for curating ADL datasets, creating ADL-X, a multiview, multimodal RGBS instruction-tuning dataset. Additionally, we introduce LLAVIDAL, an LLVM integrating videos, 3D skeletons, and HOIs to model ADL's complex spatiotemporal relationships. For training LLAVIDAL a simple joint alignment of all modalities yields suboptimal results; thus, we propose a Multimodal Progressive (MMPro) training strategy, incorporating modalities in stages following a curriculum. We also establish ADL MCQ and video description benchmarks to assess LLVM performance in ADL tasks. Trained on ADL-X, LLAVIDAL achieves state-of-the-art performance across ADL benchmarks. Code and data will be made publicly available at: https://adl-x.github.io/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel, training-free approach to scene change detection. Our method leverages tracking models, which inherently perform change detection between consecutive frames of video by identifying common objects and detecting new or missing objects. Specifically, our method takes advantage of the change detection effect of the tracking model by inputting reference and query images instead of consecutive frames. Furthermore, we focus on the content gap and style gap between two input images in change detection, and address both issues by proposing adaptive content threshold and style bridging layers, respectively. Finally, we extend our approach to video, leveraging rich temporal information to enhance the performance of scene change detection. We compare our approach and baseline through various experiments. While existing train-based baseline tend to specialize only in the trained domain, our method shows consistent performance across various domains, proving the competitiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Humans as Checkerboards: Calibrating Camera Motion Scale for World-Coordinate Human Mesh Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate camera motion estimation is essential for recovering global human motion in world coordinates from RGB video inputs. SLAM is widely used for estimating camera trajectory and point cloud, but monocular SLAM does so only up to an unknown scale factor. Previous works estimate the scale factor through optimization, but this is unreliable and time-consuming. This paper presents an optimization-free scale calibration framework, Human as Checkerboard (HAC). HAC innovatively leverages the human body predicted by human mesh recovery model as a calibration reference. Specifically, it uses the absolute depth of human-scene contact joints as references to calibrate the corresponding relative scene depth from SLAM. HAC benefits from geometric priors encoded in human mesh recovery models to estimate the SLAM scale and achieves precise global human motion estimation. Simple yet powerful, our method sets a new state-of-the-art performance for global human mesh estimation tasks, reducing motion errors by 50% over prior local-to-global methods while using 100$\times$ less inference time than optimization-based methods.

      <title>Optimized 3D Point Labeling with Leaders Using the Beams Displacement Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In three-dimensional geographical scenes, adding labels with leader lines to point features can significantly improve their visibility. Leadered labels have a large degree of freedom in position con-figuration, but existing methods are mostly based on limited position candidate models, which not only fail to effectively utilize the map space but also make it difficult to consider the relative relationships between labels. Therefore, we conceptualize the dynamic configuration process of computing label positions as akin to solving a map displacement problem. We use a triangulated graph to delineate spatial relationships among labels and calculate the forces exerted on labels considering the constraints associated with point feature labels. Then we use the Beams Displacement Method to iteratively calculate new positions for the labels. Our experimental outcomes demonstrate that this method effectively mitigates label overlay issues while maintaining minimal average directional deviation between adjacent labels. Furthermore, this method is adaptable to various types of leader line labels. Meanwhile, we also discuss the block processing strategy to improve the efficiency of label configuration and analyze the impact of different proximity graphs.</description>

      <title>MM-Tracker: Motion Mamba with Margin Loss for UAV-platform Multiple Object Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple object tracking (MOT) from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms requires efficient motion modeling. This is because UAV-MOT faces both local object motion and global camera motion. Motion blur also increases the difficulty of detecting large moving objects. Previous UAV motion modeling approaches either focus only on local motion or ignore motion blurring effects, thus limiting their tracking performance and speed. To address these issues, we propose the Motion Mamba Module, which explores both local and global motion features through cross-correlation and bi-directional Mamba Modules for better motion modeling. To address the detection difficulties caused by motion blur, we also design motion margin loss to effectively improve the detection accuracy of motion blurred objects. Based on the Motion Mamba module and motion margin loss, our proposed MM-Tracker surpasses the state-of-the-art in two widely open-source UAV-MOT datasets. Code will be available.</description>

      <title>Mask2Map: Vectorized HD Map Construction Using Bird's Eye View Segmentation Masks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13517v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Mask2Map, a novel end-to-end online HD map construction method designed for autonomous driving applications. Our approach focuses on predicting the class and ordered point set of map instances within a scene, represented in the bird's eye view (BEV). Mask2Map consists of two primary components: the Instance-Level Mask Prediction Network (IMPNet) and the Mask-Driven Map Prediction Network (MMPNet). IMPNet generates Mask-Aware Queries and BEV Segmentation Masks to capture comprehensive semantic information globally. Subsequently, MMPNet enhances these query features using local contextual information through two submodules: the Positional Query Generator (PQG) and the Geometric Feature Extractor (GFE). PQG extracts instance-level positional queries by embedding BEV positional information into Mask-Aware Queries, while GFE utilizes BEV Segmentation Masks to generate point-level geometric features. However, we observed limited performance in Mask2Map due to inter-network inconsistency stemming from different predictions to Ground Truth (GT) matching between IMPNet and MMPNet. To tackle this challenge, we propose the Inter-network Denoising Training method, which guides the model to denoise the output affected by both noisy GT queries and perturbed GT Segmentation Masks. Our evaluation conducted on nuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks demonstrates that Mask2Map achieves remarkable performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods, with gains of 10.1% mAP and 4.1 mAP, respectively. Our code can be found at https://github.com/SehwanChoi0307/Mask2Map.</description>

      <title>Move and Act: Enhanced Object Manipulation and Background Integrity for Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current methods commonly utilize three-branch structures of inversion, reconstruction, and editing, to tackle consistent image editing task. However, these methods lack control over the generation position of the edited object and have issues with background preservation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a tuning-free method with only two branches: inversion and editing. This approach allows users to simultaneously edit the object's action and control the generation position of the edited object. Additionally, it achieves improved background preservation. Specifically, we transfer the edited object information to the target area and repair or preserve the background of other areas during the inversion process at a specific time step. In the editing stage, we use the image features in self-attention to query the key and value of the corresponding time step in the inversion to achieve consistent image editing. Impressive image editing results and quantitative evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/mobiushy/move-act.</description>

      <title>Fire Dynamic Vision: Image Segmentation and Tracking for Multi-Scale Fire and Plume Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing frequency and severity of wildfires highlight the need for accurate fire and plume spread models. We introduce an approach that effectively isolates and tracks fire and plume behavior across various spatial and temporal scales and image types, identifying physical phenomena in the system and providing insights useful for developing and validating models. Our method combines image segmentation and graph theory to delineate fire fronts and plume boundaries. We demonstrate that the method effectively distinguishes fires and plumes from visually similar objects. Results demonstrate the successful isolation and tracking of fire and plume dynamics across various image sources, ranging from synoptic-scale ($10^4$-$10^5$ m) satellite images to sub-microscale ($10^0$-$10^1$ m) images captured close to the fire environment. Furthermore, the methodology leverages image inpainting and spatio-temporal dataset generation for use in statistical and machine learning models.</description>

      <title>GaussianOcc: Fully Self-supervised and Efficient 3D Occupancy Estimation with Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce GaussianOcc, a systematic method that investigates the two usages of Gaussian splatting for fully self-supervised and efficient 3D occupancy estimation in surround views. First, traditional methods for self-supervised 3D occupancy estimation still require ground truth 6D poses from sensors during training. To address this limitation, we propose Gaussian Splatting for Projection (GSP) module to provide accurate scale information for fully self-supervised training from adjacent view projection. Additionally, existing methods rely on volume rendering for final 3D voxel representation learning using 2D signals (depth maps, semantic maps), which is both time-consuming and less effective. We propose Gaussian Splatting from Voxel space (GSV) to leverage the fast rendering properties of Gaussian splatting. As a result, the proposed GaussianOcc method enables fully self-supervised (no ground truth pose) 3D occupancy estimation in competitive performance with low computational cost (2.7 times faster in training and 5 times faster in rendering). The relevant code is available in https://github.com/GANWANSHUI/GaussianOcc.git.</description>

      <title>R2G: Reasoning to Ground in 3D Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Reasoning to Ground (R2G), a neural symbolic model that grounds the target objects within 3D scenes in a reasoning manner. In contrast to prior works, R2G explicitly models the 3D scene with a semantic concept-based scene graph; recurrently simulates the attention transferring across object entities; thus makes the process of grounding the target objects with the highest probability interpretable. Specifically, we respectively embed multiple object properties within the graph nodes and spatial relations among entities within the edges, utilizing a predefined semantic vocabulary. To guide attention transferring, we employ learning or prompting-based methods to analyze the referential utterance and convert it into reasoning instructions within the same semantic space. In each reasoning round, R2G either (1) merges current attention distribution with the similarity between the instruction and embedded entity properties or (2) shifts the attention across the scene graph based on the similarity between the instruction and embedded spatial relations. The experiments on Sr3D/Nr3D benchmarks show that R2G achieves a comparable result with the prior works while maintaining improved interpretability, breaking a new path for 3D language grounding.</description>

      <title>Riemann-based Multi-scale Attention Reasoning Network for Text-3D Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the challenges in acquiring paired Text-3D data and the inherent irregularity of 3D data structures, combined representation learning of 3D point clouds and text remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel Riemann-based Multi-scale Attention Reasoning Network (RMARN) for text-3D retrieval. Specifically, the extracted text and point cloud features are refined by their respective Adaptive Feature Refiner (AFR). Furthermore, we introduce the innovative Riemann Local Similarity (RLS) module and the Global Pooling Similarity (GPS) module. However, as 3D point cloud data and text data often possess complex geometric structures in high-dimensional space, the proposed RLS employs a novel Riemann Attention Mechanism to reflect the intrinsic geometric relationships of the data. Without explicitly defining the manifold, RMARN learns the manifold parameters to better represent the distances between text-point cloud samples. To address the challenges of lacking paired text-3D data, we have created the large-scale Text-3D Retrieval dataset T3DR-HIT, which comprises over 3,380 pairs of text and point cloud data. T3DR-HIT contains coarse-grained indoor 3D scenes and fine-grained Chinese artifact scenes, consisting of 1,380 and over 2,000 text-3D pairs, respectively. Experiments on our custom datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. Our code and proposed datasets are available at \url{https://github.com/liwrui/RMARN}.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: An Adversarial Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a novel approach to function approximation, demonstrating remarkable potential in various domains. Despite their theoretical promise, the robustness of KANs under adversarial conditions has yet to be thoroughly examined. In this paper we explore the adversarial robustness of KANs, with a particular focus on image classification tasks. We assess the performance of KANs against standard white box and black-box adversarial attacks, comparing their resilience to that of established neural network architectures. Our experimental evaluation encompasses a variety of standard image classification benchmark datasets and investigates both fully connected and convolutional neural network architectures, of three sizes: small, medium, and large. We conclude that small- and medium-sized KANs (either fully connected or convolutional) are not consistently more robust than their standard counterparts, but that large-sized KANs are, by and large, more robust. This comprehensive evaluation of KANs in adversarial scenarios offers the first in-depth analysis of KAN security, laying the groundwork for future research in this emerging field.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Mean Embeddings for Better Diagnostics of Image Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evaluation of image generators remains a challenge due to the limitations of traditional metrics in providing nuanced insights into specific image regions. This is a critical problem as not all regions of an image may be learned with similar ease. In this work, we propose a novel approach to disentangle the cosine similarity of mean embeddings into the product of cosine similarities for individual pixel clusters via central kernel alignment. Consequently, we can quantify the contribution of the cluster-wise performance to the overall image generation performance. We demonstrate how this enhances the explainability and the likelihood of identifying pixel regions of model misbehavior across various real-world use cases.</description>

      <title>Retinex-RAWMamba: Bridging Demosaicing and Denoising for Low-Light RAW Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-light image enhancement, particularly in cross-domain tasks such as mapping from the raw domain to the sRGB domain, remains a significant challenge. Many deep learning-based methods have been developed to address this issue and have shown promising results in recent years. However, single-stage methods, which attempt to unify the complex mapping across both domains, leading to limited denoising performance. In contrast, two-stage approaches typically decompose a raw image with color filter arrays (CFA) into a four-channel RGGB format before feeding it into a neural network. However, this strategy overlooks the critical role of demosaicing within the Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline, leading to color distortions under varying lighting conditions, especially in low-light scenarios. To address these issues, we design a novel Mamba scanning mechanism, called RAWMamba, to effectively handle raw images with different CFAs. Furthermore, we present a Retinex Decomposition Module (RDM) grounded in Retinex prior, which decouples illumination from reflectance to facilitate more effective denoising and automatic non-linear exposure correction. By bridging demosaicing and denoising, better raw image enhancement is achieved. Experimental evaluations conducted on public datasets SID and MCR demonstrate that our proposed RAWMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on cross-domain mapping.</description>

      <title>Guiding Vision-Language Model Selection for Visual Question-Answering Across Tasks, Domains, and Knowledge Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual Question-Answering (VQA) has become key to user experience, particularly after improved generalization capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). But evaluating VLMs for an application requirement using a standardized framework in practical settings is still challenging. This paper aims to solve that using an end-to-end framework. We present VQA360 - a novel dataset derived from established VQA benchmarks, annotated with task types, application domains, and knowledge types, for a comprehensive evaluation. We also introduce GoEval, a multimodal evaluation metric developed using GPT-4o, achieving a correlation factor of 56.71% with human judgments. Our experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs reveal that no single model excels universally, thus, making a right choice a key design decision. Proprietary models such as Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o-mini generally outperform others, but open-source models like InternVL-2-8B and CogVLM-2-Llama-3-19B also demonstrate competitive strengths, while providing additional advantages. Our framework can also be extended to other tasks.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Level Feature Distancing for Machine Unlearning: Towards a Better Trade-off Between Model Utility and Forgetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14747v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the explosive growth of deep learning applications and increasing privacy concerns, the right to be forgotten has become a critical requirement in various AI industries. For example, given a facial recognition system, some individuals may wish to remove their personal data that might have been used in the training phase. Unfortunately, deep neural networks sometimes unexpectedly leak personal identities, making this removal challenging. While recent machine unlearning algorithms aim to enable models to forget specific data, we identify an unintended utility drop-correlation collapse-in which the essential correlations between image features and true labels weaken during the forgetting process. To address this challenge, we propose Distribution-Level Feature Distancing (DLFD), a novel method that efficiently forgets instances while preserving task-relevant feature correlations. Our method synthesizes data samples by optimizing the feature distribution to be distinctly different from that of forget samples, achieving effective results within a single training epoch. Through extensive experiments on facial recognition datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art machine unlearning methods in both forgetting performance and model utility preservation.</description>

      <title>Game4Loc: A UAV Geo-Localization Benchmark from Game Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vision-based geo-localization technology for UAV, serving as a secondary source of GPS information in addition to the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), can still operate independently in the GPS-denied environment. Recent deep learning based methods attribute this as the task of image matching and retrieval. By retrieving drone-view images in geo-tagged satellite image database, approximate localization information can be obtained. However, due to high costs and privacy concerns, it is usually difficult to obtain large quantities of drone-view images from a continuous area. Existing drone-view datasets are mostly composed of small-scale aerial photography with a strong assumption that there exists a perfect one-to-one aligned reference image for any query, leaving a significant gap from the practical localization scenario. In this work, we construct a large-range contiguous area UAV geo-localization dataset named GTA-UAV, featuring multiple flight altitudes, attitudes, scenes, and targets using modern computer games. Based on this dataset, we introduce a more practical UAV geo-localization task including partial matches of cross-view paired data, and expand the image-level retrieval to the actual localization in terms of distance (meters). For the construction of drone-view and satellite-view pairs, we adopt a weight-based contrastive learning approach, which allows for effective learning while avoiding additional post-processing matching steps. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our data and training method for UAV geo-localization, as well as the generalization capabilities to real-world scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We explore the transformative potential of SAM 2, a vision foundation model, in advancing gaze estimation and eye tracking technologies. By significantly reducing annotation time, lowering technical barriers through its ease of deployment, and enhancing segmentation accuracy, SAM 2 addresses critical challenges faced by researchers and practitioners. Utilizing its zero-shot segmentation capabilities with minimal user input-a single click per video-we tested SAM 2 on over 14 million eye images from diverse datasets, including virtual reality setups and the world's largest unified dataset recorded using wearable eye trackers. Remarkably, in pupil segmentation tasks, SAM 2 matches the performance of domain-specific models trained solely on eye images, achieving competitive mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) scores of up to 93% without fine-tuning. Additionally, we provide our code and segmentation masks for these widely used datasets to promote further research.</description>

      <title>Altogether: Image Captioning via Re-aligning Alt-text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on creating synthetic data to improve the quality of image captions. Existing works typically have two shortcomings. First, they caption images from scratch, ignoring existing alt-text metadata, and second, lack transparency if the captioners' training data (e.g. GPT) is unknown. In this paper, we study a principled approach Altogether based on the key idea to edit and re-align existing alt-texts associated with the images. To generate training data, we perform human annotation where annotators start with the existing alt-text and re-align it to the image content in multiple rounds, consequently constructing captions with rich visual concepts. This differs from prior work that carries out human annotation as a one-time description task solely based on images and annotator knowledge. We train a captioner on this data that generalizes the process of re-aligning alt-texts at scale. Our results show our Altogether approach leads to richer image captions that also improve text-to-image generation and zero-shot image classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral Imaging-Based Perception in Autonomous Driving Scenarios: Benchmarking Baseline Semantic Segmentation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) is known for its advantages over traditional RGB imaging in remote sensing, agriculture, and medicine. Recently, it has gained attention for enhancing Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) perception. Several HSI datasets such as HyKo, HSI-Drive, HSI-Road, and Hyperspectral City have been made available. However, a comprehensive evaluation of semantic segmentation models (SSM) using these datasets is lacking. To address this gap, we evaluated the available annotated HSI datasets on four deep learning-based baseline SSMs: DeepLab v3+, HRNet, PSPNet, and U-Net, along with its two variants: Coordinate Attention (UNet-CA) and Convolutional Block-Attention Module (UNet-CBAM). The original model architectures were adapted to handle the varying spatial and spectral dimensions of the datasets. These baseline SSMs were trained using a class-weighted loss function for individual HSI datasets and evaluated using mean-based metrics such as intersection over union (IoU), recall, precision, F1 score, specificity, and accuracy. Our results indicate that UNet-CBAM, which extracts channel-wise features, outperforms other SSMs and shows potential to leverage spectral information for enhanced semantic segmentation. This study establishes a baseline SSM benchmark on available annotated datasets for future evaluation of HSI-based ADAS perception. However, limitations of current HSI datasets, such as limited dataset size, high class imbalance, and lack of fine-grained annotations, remain significant constraints for developing robust SSMs for ADAS applications.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Hidden Subspaces in Video Diffusion Models Using Re-Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Latent Video Diffusion Models can easily deceive casual observers and domain experts alike thanks to the produced image quality and temporal consistency. Beyond entertainment, this creates opportunities around safe data sharing of fully synthetic datasets, which are crucial in healthcare, as well as other domains relying on sensitive personal information. However, privacy concerns with this approach have not fully been addressed yet, and models trained on synthetic data for specific downstream tasks still perform worse than those trained on real data. This discrepancy may be partly due to the sampling space being a subspace of the training videos, effectively reducing the training data size for downstream models. Additionally, the reduced temporal consistency when generating long videos could be a contributing factor.
  In this paper, we first show that training privacy-preserving models in latent space is computationally more efficient and generalize better. Furthermore, to investigate downstream degradation factors, we propose to use a re-identification model, previously employed as a privacy preservation filter. We demonstrate that it is sufficient to train this model on the latent space of the video generator. Subsequently, we use these models to evaluate the subspace covered by synthetic video datasets and thus introduce a new way to measure the faithfulness of generative machine learning models. We focus on a specific application in healthcare echocardiography to illustrate the effectiveness of our novel methods. Our findings indicate that only up to 30.8% of the training videos are learned in latent video diffusion models, which could explain the lack of performance when training downstream tasks on synthetic data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many industrial and service sectors require tools to extract vehicle characteristics from images. This is a complex task not only by the variety of noise, and large number of classes, but also by the constant introduction of new vehicle models to the market. In this paper, we present Veri-Car, an information retrieval integrated approach designed to help on this task. It leverages supervised learning techniques to accurately identify the make, type, model, year, color, and license plate of cars. The approach also addresses the challenge of handling open-world problems, where new car models and variations frequently emerge, by employing a sophisticated combination of pre-trained models, and a hierarchical multi-similarity loss. Veri-Car demonstrates robust performance, achieving high precision and accuracy in classifying both seen and unseen data. Additionally, it integrates an ensemble license plate detection, and an OCR model to extract license plate numbers with impressive accuracy.</description>

      <title>EVQAScore: Efficient Video Question Answering Data Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video question-answering (QA) is a core task in video understanding. Evaluating the quality of video QA and video caption data quality for training video large language models (VideoLLMs) is an essential challenge. Although various methods have been proposed for assessing video caption quality, there remains a lack of dedicated evaluation methods for Video QA. To address this gap, we introduce EVQAScore, a reference-free method that leverages keyword extraction to assess both video caption and video QA data quality. Additionally, we incorporate frame sampling and rescaling techniques to enhance the efficiency and robustness of our evaluation, this enables our score to evaluate the quality of extremely long videos. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance (32.8 for Kendall correlation and 42.3 for Spearman correlation, 4.7 and 5.9 higher than the previous method PAC-S++) on the VATEX-EVAL benchmark for video caption evaluation. Furthermore, by using EVQAScore for data selection, we achieved SOTA results with only 12.5\% of the original data volume, outperforming the previous SOTA method PAC-S and 100\% of data.</description>

      <title>Image Generation Diversity Issues and How to Tame Them</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative methods now produce outputs nearly indistinguishable from real data but often fail to fully capture the data distribution. Unlike quality issues, diversity limitations in generative models are hard to detect visually, requiring specific metrics for assessment. In this paper, we draw attention to the current lack of diversity in generative models and the inability of common metrics to measure this. We achieve this by framing diversity as an image retrieval problem, where we measure how many real images can be retrieved using synthetic data as queries. This yields the Image Retrieval Score (IRS), an interpretable, hyperparameter-free metric that quantifies the diversity of a generative model's output. IRS requires only a subset of synthetic samples and provides a statistical measure of confidence. Our experiments indicate that current feature extractors commonly used in generative model assessment are inadequate for evaluating diversity effectively. Consequently, we perform an extensive search for the best feature extractors to assess diversity. Evaluation reveals that current diffusion models converge to limited subsets of the real distribution, with no current state-of-the-art models superpassing 77% of the diversity of the training data. To address this limitation, we introduce Diversity-Aware Diffusion Models (DiADM), a novel approach that improves diversity of unconditional diffusion models without loss of image quality. We do this by disentangling diversity from image quality by using a diversity aware module that uses pseudo-unconditional features as input. We provide a Python package offering unified feature extraction and metric computation to further facilitate the evaluation of generative models https://github.com/MischaD/beyondfid.</description>

      <title>Patchfinder: Leveraging Visual Language Models for Accurate Information Retrieval using Model Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For decades, corporations and governments have relied on scanned documents to record vast amounts of information. However, extracting this information is a slow and tedious process due to the overwhelming amount of documents. The rise of vision language models presents a way to efficiently and accurately extract the information out of these documents. The current automated workflow often requires a two-step approach involving the extraction of information using optical character recognition software, and subsequent usage of large language models for processing this information. Unfortunately, these methods encounter significant challenges when dealing with noisy scanned documents. The high information density of such documents often necessitates using computationally expensive language models to effectively reduce noise.
  In this study, we propose PatchFinder, an algorithm that builds upon Vision Language Models (VLMs) to address the information extraction task. First, we devise a confidence-based score, called Patch Confidence, based on the Maximum Softmax Probability of the VLMs' output to measure the model's confidence in its predictions. Then, PatchFinder utilizes that score to determine a suitable patch size, partition the input document into overlapping patches of that size, and generate confidence-based predictions for the target information. Our experimental results show that PatchFinder can leverage Phi-3v, a 4.2 billion parameter vision language model, to achieve an accuracy of 94% on our dataset of 190 noisy scanned documents, surpassing the performance of ChatGPT-4o by 18.5 percentage points.</description>

      <title>MT3DNet: Multi-Task learning Network for 3D Surgical Scene Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In image-assisted minimally invasive surgeries (MIS), understanding surgical scenes is vital for real-time feedback to surgeons, skill evaluation, and improving outcomes through collaborative human-robot procedures. Within this context, the challenge lies in accurately detecting, segmenting, and estimating the depth of surgical scenes depicted in high-resolution images, while simultaneously reconstructing the scene in 3D and providing segmentation of surgical instruments along with detection labels for each instrument. To address this challenge, a novel Multi-Task Learning (MTL) network is proposed for performing these tasks concurrently. A key aspect of this approach involves overcoming the optimization hurdles associated with handling multiple tasks concurrently by integrating a Adversarial Weight Update into the MTL framework, the proposed MTL model achieves 3D reconstruction through the integration of segmentation, depth estimation, and object detection, thereby enhancing the understanding of surgical scenes, which marks a significant advancement compared to existing studies that lack 3D capabilities. Comprehensive experiments on the EndoVis2018 benchmark dataset underscore the adeptness of the model in efficiently addressing all three tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed techniques.</description>

      <title>Instructional Video Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the recent strides in video generation, state-of-the-art methods still struggle with elements of visual detail. One particularly challenging case is the class of egocentric instructional videos in which the intricate motion of the hand coupled with a mostly stable and non-distracting environment is necessary to convey the appropriate visual action instruction. To address these challenges, we introduce a new method for instructional video generation. Our diffusion-based method incorporates two distinct innovations. First, we propose an automatic method to generate the expected region of motion, guided by both the visual context and the action text. Second, we introduce a critical hand structure loss to guide the diffusion model to focus on smooth and consistent hand poses. We evaluate our method on augmented instructional datasets based on EpicKitchens and Ego4D, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of instructional clarity, especially of the hand motion in the target region, across diverse environments and actions.

      <title>Liquid: Language Models are Scalable Multi-modal Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Liquid, an auto-regressive generation paradigm that seamlessly integrates visual comprehension and generation by tokenizing images into discrete codes and learning these code embeddings alongside text tokens within a shared feature space for both vision and language. Unlike previous multimodal large language model (MLLM), Liquid achieves this integration using a single large language model (LLM), eliminating the need for external pretrained visual embeddings such as CLIP. For the first time, Liquid uncovers a scaling law that performance drop unavoidably brought by the unified training of visual and language tasks diminishes as the model size increases. Furthermore, the unified token space enables visual generation and comprehension tasks to mutually enhance each other, effectively removing the typical interference seen in earlier models. We show that existing LLMs can serve as strong foundations for Liquid, saving 100x in training costs while outperforming Chameleon in multimodal capabilities and maintaining language performance comparable to mainstream LLMs like LLAMA2. Liquid also outperforms models like SD v2.1 and SD-XL (FID of 5.47 on MJHQ-30K), excelling in both vision-language and text-only tasks. This work demonstrates that LLMs such as LLAMA3.2 and GEMMA2 are powerful multimodal generators, offering a scalable solution for enhancing both vision-language understanding and generation. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/FoundationVision/Liquid.</description>

      <title>DualPM: Dual Posed-Canonical Point Maps for 3D Shape and Pose Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The choice of data representation is a key factor in the success of deep learning in geometric tasks. For instance, DUSt3R has recently introduced the concept of viewpoint-invariant point maps, generalizing depth prediction, and showing that one can reduce all the key problems in the 3D reconstruction of static scenes to predicting such point maps. In this paper, we develop an analogous concept for a very different problem, namely, the reconstruction of the 3D shape and pose of deformable objects. To this end, we introduce the Dual Point Maps (DualPM), where a pair of point maps is extracted from the same image, one associating pixels to their 3D locations on the object, and the other to a canonical version of the object at rest pose. We also extend point maps to amodal reconstruction, seeing through self-occlusions to obtain the complete shape of the object. We show that 3D reconstruction and 3D pose estimation reduce to the prediction of the DualPMs. We demonstrate empirically that this representation is a good target for a deep network to predict; specifically, we consider modeling horses, showing that DualPMs can be trained purely on 3D synthetic data, consisting of a single model of a horse, while generalizing very well to real images. With this, we improve by a large margin previous methods for the 3D analysis and reconstruction of this type of objects.</description>

      <title>Addressing Attribute Leakages in Diffusion-based Image Editing without Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become a cornerstone in image editing, offering flexibility with language prompts and source images. However, a key challenge is attribute leakage, where unintended modifications occur in non-target regions or within target regions due to attribute interference. Existing methods often suffer from leakage due to naive text embeddings and inadequate handling of End-of-Sequence (EOS) token embeddings. To address this, we propose ALE-Edit (Attribute-leakage-free editing), a novel framework to minimize attribute leakage with three components: (1) Object-Restricted Embeddings (ORE) to localize object-specific attributes in text embeddings, (2) Region-Guided Blending for Cross-Attention Masking (RGB-CAM) to align attention with target regions, and (3) Background Blending (BB) to preserve non-edited regions. Additionally, we introduce ALE-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating attribute leakage with new metrics for target-external and target-internal leakage. Experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly reduces attribute leakage while maintaining high editing quality, providing an efficient and tuning-free solution for multi-object image editing.</description>

      <title>Espresso: High Compression For Rich Extraction From Videos for Your Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most of the current vision-language models (VLMs) for videos struggle to understand videos longer than a few seconds. This is primarily due to the fact that they do not scale to utilizing a large number of frames. In order to address this limitation, we propose Espresso, a novel method that extracts and compresses spatial and temporal information separately. Through extensive evaluations, we show that spatial and temporal compression in Espresso each have a positive impact on the long-form video understanding capabilities; when combined, their positive impact increases. Furthermore, we show that Espresso's performance scales well with more training data, and that Espresso is far more effective than the existing projectors for VLMs in long-form video understanding. Moreover, we devise a more difficult evaluation setting for EgoSchema called "needle-in-a-haystack" that multiplies the lengths of the input videos. Espresso achieves SOTA performance on this task, outperforming the SOTA VLMs that have been trained on much more training data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) technology has transformed modern archaeology by unveiling hidden landscapes beneath dense vegetation. However, the lack of expert-annotated, open-access resources has hindered the analysis of ALS data using advanced deep learning techniques. We address this limitation with Archaeoscape (available at https://archaeoscape.ai/data/2024/), a novel large-scale archaeological ALS dataset spanning 888 km$^2$ in Cambodia with 31,141 annotated archaeological features from the Angkorian period. Archaeoscape is over four times larger than comparable datasets, and the first ALS archaeology resource with open-access data, annotations, and models.
  We benchmark several recent segmentation models to demonstrate the benefits of modern vision techniques for this problem and highlight the unique challenges of discovering subtle human-made structures under dense jungle canopies. By making Archaeoscape available in open access, we hope to bridge the gap between traditional archaeology and modern computer vision methods.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel semantic splatting approach based on Gaussian Splatting to achieve efficient and low-latency. Our method projects the RGB attributes and semantic features of point clouds onto the image plane, simultaneously rendering RGB images and semantic segmentation results. Leveraging the explicit structure of point clouds and a one-time rendering strategy, our approach significantly enhances efficiency during optimization and rendering. Additionally, we employ SAM2 to generate pseudo-labels for boundary regions, which often lack sufficient supervision, and introduce two-level aggregation losses at the 2D feature map and 3D spatial levels to improve the view-consistent and spatial continuity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized feed-forward Gaussian models have achieved significant progress in sparse-view 3D reconstruction by leveraging prior knowledge from large multi-view datasets. However, these models often struggle to represent high-frequency details due to the limited number of Gaussians. While the densification strategy used in per-scene 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) optimization can be adapted to the feed-forward models, it may not be ideally suited for generalized scenarios. In this paper, we propose Generative Densification, an efficient and generalizable method to densify Gaussians generated by feed-forward models. Unlike the 3D-GS densification strategy, which iteratively splits and clones raw Gaussian parameters, our method up-samples feature representations from the feed-forward models and generates their corresponding fine Gaussians in a single forward pass, leveraging the embedded prior knowledge for enhanced generalization. Experimental results on both object-level and scene-level reconstruction tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with comparable or smaller model sizes, achieving notable improvements in representing fine details.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted significant attention for its potential to revolutionize 3D representation, rendering, and interaction. Despite the rapid growth of 3DGS research, its direct application to Extended Reality (XR) remains underexplored. Although many studies recognize the potential of 3DGS for XR, few have explicitly focused on or demonstrated its effectiveness within XR environments. In this paper, we aim to synthesize innovations in 3DGS that show specific potential for advancing XR research and development. We conduct a comprehensive review of publicly available 3DGS papers, with a focus on those referencing XR-related concepts. Additionally, we perform an in-depth analysis of innovations explicitly relevant to XR and propose a taxonomy to highlight their significance. Building on these insights, we propose several prospective XR research areas where 3DGS can make promising contributions, yet remain rarely touched. By investigating the intersection of 3DGS and XR, this paper provides a roadmap to push the boundaries of XR using cutting-edge 3DGS techniques.</description>

However, when faced with perception-limited areas (dynamic or static occlusion regions), MLLMs struggle to effectively integrate perception ability with world knowledge for reasoning. These perception-limited regions can conceal crucial safety information, especially for vulnerable road users. In this paper, we propose a framework, which aims to improve autonomous driving performance under perceptionlimited conditions by enhancing the integration of perception capabilities and world knowledge. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play instruction-guided interaction module that bridges modality gaps and significantly reduces the input sequence length, allowing it to adapt effectively to multi-view video inputs. Furthermore, to better integrate world knowledge with driving-related tasks, we have collected and refined a large-scale multi-modal dataset that includes 2 million natural language QA pairs, 1.7 million grounding task data. To evaluate the model's utilization of world knowledge, we introduce an object-level risk assessment dataset comprising 200K QA pairs, where the questions necessitate multi-step reasoning leveraging world knowledge for resolution. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Agent Journey Beyond RGB: Unveiling Hybrid Semantic-Spatial Environmental Representations for Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Navigating unseen environments based on natural language instructions remains difficult for egocentric agents in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). While recent advancements have yielded promising outcomes, they primarily rely on RGB images for environmental representation, often overlooking the underlying semantic knowledge and spatial cues. Intuitively, humans inherently ground textual semantics within the spatial layout during indoor navigation. Inspired by this, we propose a versatile Semantic Understanding and Spatial Awareness (SUSA) architecture to facilitate navigation. SUSA includes a Textual Semantic Understanding (TSU) module, which narrows the modality gap between instructions and environments by generating and associating the descriptions of environmental landmarks in the agent's immediate surroundings. Additionally, a Depth-based Spatial Perception (DSP) module incrementally constructs a depth exploration map, enabling a more nuanced comprehension of environmental layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that SUSA hybrid semantic-spatial representations effectively enhance navigation performance, setting new state-of-the-art performance across three VLN benchmarks (REVERIE, R2R, and SOON). The source code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>DriveMM: All-in-One Large Multimodal Model for Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated exceptional comprehension and interpretation capabilities in Autonomous Driving (AD) by incorporating large language models. Despite the advancements, current data-driven AD approaches tend to concentrate on a single dataset and specific tasks, neglecting their overall capabilities and ability to generalize. To bridge these gaps, we propose DriveMM, a general large multimodal model designed to process diverse data inputs, such as images and multi-view videos, while performing a broad spectrum of AD tasks, including perception, prediction, and planning. Initially, the model undergoes curriculum pre-training to process varied visual signals and perform basic visual comprehension and perception tasks. Subsequently, we augment and standardize various AD-related datasets to fine-tune the model, resulting in an all-in-one LMM for autonomous driving. To assess the general capabilities and generalization ability, we conduct evaluations on six public benchmarks and undertake zero-shot transfer on an unseen dataset, where DriveMM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks. We hope DriveMM as a promising solution for future end-to-end autonomous driving applications in the real world. Project page with code: https://github.com/zhijian11/DriveMM.</description>

      <title>Learning Visual Generative Priors without Text</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although text-to-image (T2I) models have recently thrived as visual generative priors, their reliance on high-quality text-image pairs makes scaling up expensive. We argue that grasping the cross-modality alignment is not a necessity for a sound visual generative prior, whose focus should be on texture modeling. Such a philosophy inspires us to study image-to-image (I2I) generation, where models can learn from in-the-wild images in a self-supervised manner. We first develop a pure vision-based training framework, Lumos, and confirm the feasibility and the scalability of learning I2I models. We then find that, as an upstream task of T2I, our I2I model serves as a more foundational visual prior and achieves on-par or better performance than existing T2I models using only 1/10 text-image pairs for fine-tuning. We further demonstrate the superiority of I2I priors over T2I priors on some text-irrelevant visual generative tasks, like image-to-3D and image-to-video.

      <title>UniReal: Universal Image Generation and Editing via Learning Real-world Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce UniReal, a unified framework designed to address various image generation and editing tasks. Existing solutions often vary by tasks, yet share fundamental principles: preserving consistency between inputs and outputs while capturing visual variations. Inspired by recent video generation models that effectively balance consistency and variation across frames, we propose a unifying approach that treats image-level tasks as discontinuous video generation. Specifically, we treat varying numbers of input and output images as frames, enabling seamless support for tasks such as image generation, editing, customization, composition, etc. Although designed for image-level tasks, we leverage videos as a scalable source for universal supervision. UniReal learns world dynamics from large-scale videos, demonstrating advanced capability in handling shadows, reflections, pose variation, and object interaction, while also exhibiting emergent capability for novel applications.</description>

      <title>CoDTS: Enhancing Sparsely Supervised Collaborative Perception with a Dual Teacher-Student Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current collaborative perception methods often rely on fully annotated datasets, which can be expensive to obtain in practical situations. To reduce annotation costs, some works adopt sparsely supervised learning techniques and generate pseudo labels for the missing instances. However, these methods fail to achieve an optimal confidence threshold that harmonizes the quality and quantity of pseudo labels. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end Collaborative perception Dual Teacher-Student framework (CoDTS), which employs adaptive complementary learning to produce both high-quality and high-quantity pseudo labels. Specifically, the Main Foreground Mining (MFM) module generates high-quality pseudo labels based on the prediction of the static teacher. Subsequently, the Supplement Foreground Mining (SFM) module ensures a balance between the quality and quantity of pseudo labels by adaptively identifying missing instances based on the prediction of the dynamic teacher. Additionally, the Neighbor Anchor Sampling (NAS) module is incorporated to enhance the representation of pseudo labels. To promote the adaptive complementary learning, we implement a staged training strategy that trains the student and dynamic teacher in a mutually beneficial manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the CoDTS effectively ensures an optimal balance of pseudo labels in both quality and quantity, establishing a new state-of-the-art in sparsely supervised collaborative perception.</description>

      <title>Video Summarization using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video summarization aims to eliminate visual redundancy while retaining key parts of video to construct concise and comprehensive synopses. Most existing methods use discriminative models to predict the importance scores of video frames. However, these methods are susceptible to annotation inconsistency caused by the inherent subjectivity of different annotators when annotating the same video. In this paper, we introduce a generative framework for video summarization that learns how to generate summaries from a probability distribution perspective, effectively reducing the interference of subjective annotation noise. Specifically, we propose a novel diffusion summarization method based on the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), which learns the probability distribution of training data through noise prediction, and generates summaries by iterative denoising. Our method is more resistant to subjective annotation noise, and is less prone to overfitting the training data than discriminative methods, with strong generalization ability. Moreover, to facilitate training DDPM with limited data, we employ an unsupervised video summarization model to implement the earlier denoising process. Extensive experiments on various datasets (TVSum, SumMe, and FPVSum) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Pragmatist: Multiview Conditional Diffusion Models for High-Fidelity 3D Reconstruction from Unposed Sparse Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inferring 3D structures from sparse, unposed observations is challenging due to its unconstrained nature. Recent methods propose to predict implicit representations directly from unposed inputs in a data-driven manner, achieving promising results. However, these methods do not utilize geometric priors and cannot hallucinate the appearance of unseen regions, thus making it challenging to reconstruct fine geometric and textural details. To tackle this challenge, our key idea is to reformulate this ill-posed problem as conditional novel view synthesis, aiming to generate complete observations from limited input views to facilitate reconstruction. With complete observations, the poses of the input views can be easily recovered and further used to optimize the reconstructed object. To this end, we propose a novel pipeline Pragmatist. First, we generate a complete observation of the object via a multiview conditional diffusion model. Then, we use a feed-forward large reconstruction model to obtain the reconstructed mesh. To further improve the reconstruction quality, we recover the poses of input views by inverting the obtained 3D representations and further optimize the texture using detailed input views. Unlike previous approaches, our pipeline improves reconstruction by efficiently leveraging unposed inputs and generative priors, circumventing the direct resolution of highly ill-posed problems. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves promising performance in several benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Accurate Water Level Monitoring in AWD Rice Cultivation Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) method is a rice-growing water management technique promoted as a sustainable alternative to Continuous Flooding (CF). Climate change has placed the agricultural sector in a challenging position, particularly as global water resources become increasingly scarce, affecting rice production on irrigated lowlands. Rice, a staple food for over half of the world's population, demands significantly more water than other major crops. In Bangladesh, Boro rice, in particular, requires considerable water inputs during its cultivation. Traditionally, farmers manually measure water levels, a process that is both time-consuming and prone to errors. While ultrasonic sensors offer improvements in water height measurement, they still face limitations, such as susceptibility to weather conditions and environmental factors. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that automates water height measurement using computer vision, specifically through a convolutional neural network (CNN). Our attention-based architecture achieved an $R^2$ score of 0.9885 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.2766, providing a more accurate and efficient solution for managing AWD systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Flow Fields in Attention for Controllable Person Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controllable person image generation aims to generate a person image conditioned on reference images, allowing precise control over the person's appearance or pose. However, prior methods often distort fine-grained textural details from the reference image, despite achieving high overall image quality. We attribute these distortions to inadequate attention to corresponding regions in the reference image. To address this, we thereby propose learning flow fields in attention (Leffa), which explicitly guides the target query to attend to the correct reference key in the attention layer during training. Specifically, it is realized via a regularization loss on top of the attention map within a diffusion-based baseline. Our extensive experiments show that Leffa achieves state-of-the-art performance in controlling appearance (virtual try-on) and pose (pose transfer), significantly reducing fine-grained detail distortion while maintaining high image quality. Additionally, we show that our loss is model-agnostic and can be used to improve the performance of other diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models via Directed Scene Graph for Comprehensive Image Captioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating detailed captions comprehending text-rich visual content in images has received growing attention for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, few studies have developed benchmarks specifically tailored for detailed captions to measure their accuracy and comprehensiveness. In this paper, we introduce a detailed caption benchmark, termed as CompreCap, to evaluate the visual context from a directed scene graph view. Concretely, we first manually segment the image into semantically meaningful regions (i.e., semantic segmentation mask) according to common-object vocabulary, while also distinguishing attributes of objects within all those regions. Then directional relation labels of these objects are annotated to compose a directed scene graph that can well encode rich compositional information of the image. Based on our directed scene graph, we develop a pipeline to assess the generated detailed captions from LVLMs on multiple levels, including the object-level coverage, the accuracy of attribute descriptions, the score of key relationships, etc. Experimental results on the CompreCap dataset confirm that our evaluation method aligns closely with human evaluation scores across LVLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.02160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical imaging datasets are inherently high dimensional with large variability and low sample sizes that limit the effectiveness of deep learning algorithms. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) with the ability to synthesize realist images have shown great potential as an alternative to standard data augmentation techniques. Our work focuses on cross-modality synthesis of fluorodeoxyglucose~(FDG) Positron Emission Tomography~(PET) scans from structural Magnetic Resonance~(MR) images using generative models to facilitate multi-modal diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, we propose a novel end-to-end, globally and locally aware image-to-image translation GAN (GLA-GAN) with a multi-path architecture that enforces both global structural integrity and fidelity to local details. We further supplement the standard adversarial loss with voxel-level intensity, multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) and region-of-interest (ROI) based loss components that reduce reconstruction error, enforce structural consistency at different scales and perceive variation in regional sensitivity to AD respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our GLA-GAN not only generates synthesized FDG-PET scans with enhanced image quality but also superior clinical utility in improving AD diagnosis compared to state-of-the-art models. Finally, we attempt to interpret some of the internal units of the GAN that are closely related to this specific cross-modality generation task.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on Test-Time Adaptation under Distribution Shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning methods strive to acquire a robust model during the training process that can effectively generalize to test samples, even in the presence of distribution shifts. However, these methods often suffer from performance degradation due to unknown test distributions. Test-time adaptation (TTA), an emerging paradigm, has the potential to adapt a pre-trained model to unlabeled data during testing, before making predictions. Recent progress in this paradigm has highlighted the significant benefits of using unlabeled data to train self-adapted models prior to inference. In this survey, we categorize TTA into several distinct groups based on the form of test data, namely, test-time domain adaptation, test-time batch adaptation, and online test-time adaptation. For each category, we provide a comprehensive taxonomy of advanced algorithms and discuss various learning scenarios. Furthermore, we analyze relevant applications of TTA and discuss open challenges and promising areas for future research. For a comprehensive list of TTA methods, kindly refer to \url{https://github.com/tim-learn/awesome-test-time-adaptation}.</description>

      <title>NeuralFuse: Learning to Recover the Accuracy of Access-Limited Neural Network Inference in Low-Voltage Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become ubiquitous in machine learning, but their energy consumption remains problematically high. An effective strategy for reducing such consumption is supply-voltage reduction, but if done too aggressively, it can lead to accuracy degradation. This is due to random bit-flips in static random access memory (SRAM), where model parameters are stored. To address this challenge, we have developed NeuralFuse, a novel add-on module that handles the energy-accuracy tradeoff in low-voltage regimes by learning input transformations and using them to generate error-resistant data representations, thereby protecting DNN accuracy in both nominal and low-voltage scenarios. As well as being easy to implement, NeuralFuse can be readily applied to DNNs with limited access, such cloud-based APIs that are accessed remotely or non-configurable hardware. Our experimental results demonstrate that, at a 1% bit-error rate, NeuralFuse can reduce SRAM access energy by up to 24% while recovering accuracy by up to 57%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to addressing low-voltage-induced bit errors that requires no model retraining.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Multi-scale Approach for Speech and Dynamics Synchrony in Talking Head Generation</title>

Abstract: Animating still face images with deep generative models using a speech input signal is an active research topic and has seen important recent progress.However, much of the effort has been put into lip syncing and rendering quality while the generation of natural head motion, let alone the audio-visual correlation between head motion and speech, has often been neglected.In this work, we propose a multi-scale audio-visual synchrony loss and a multi-scale autoregressive GAN to better handle short and long-term correlation between speech and the dynamics of the head and lips.In particular, we train a stack of syncer models on multimodal input pyramids and use these models as guidance in a multi-scale generator network to produce audio-aligned motion unfolding over diverse time scales.Both the pyramid of audio-visual syncers and the generative models are trained in a low-dimensional space that fully preserves dynamics cues.The experiments show significant improvements over the state-of-the-art in head motion dynamics quality and especially in multi-scale audio-visual synchrony on a collection of benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>A simple thinking about the application of the attention mechanism in medical ultrasound image segmentation task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The AI-based assisted diagnosis programs have been widely investigated on medical ultrasound images. Complex scenario of ultrasound image, in which the coupled interference of internal and external factors is severe, brings a unique challenge for localize the object region automatically and precisely in ultrasound images. In this study, we seek to propose a more general and robust Benchmark Attention Adaptive Framework (BAAF) to assist doctors segment or diagnose lesions and tissues in ultrasound images more quickly and accurately. Different from existing attention schemes, the BAAF consists of a parallel hybrid attention module (PHAM) and an adaptive calibration mechanism (ACM). Specifically, BAAF first coarsely calibrates the input features from the channel and spatial dimensions, and then adaptively selects more robust lesion or tissue characterizations from the coarse-calibrated feature maps. The design of BAAF further optimizes the "what" and "where" focus and selection problems in CNNs and seeks to improve the segmentation accuracy of lesions or tissues in medical ultrasound images. The method is evaluated on four medical ultrasound segmentation tasks, and the adequate experimental results demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the comparison with existing attention mechanisms also demonstrates the superiority of BAAF. This work provides the possibility for automated medical ultrasound assisted diagnosis and reduces reliance on human accuracy and precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) has attracted great attention from the research community due to its strict theoretical guarantees. However, researchers and developers still face challenges of applicability and efficiency when applying CP algorithms to deep learning models. In this paper, we introduce \torchcp, a comprehensive PyTorch-based toolkit to strengthen the usability of CP for deep learning models. \torchcp implements a wide range of post-hoc and training methods of conformal prediction for various machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, GNN, and LLM. Moreover, we provide user-friendly interfaces and extensive evaluations to easily integrate CP algorithms into specific tasks. Our \torchcp toolkit, built entirely with PyTorch, enables high-performance GPU acceleration for deep learning models and mini-batch computation on large-scale datasets. With the LGPL license, the code is open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/ml-stat-Sustech/TorchCP} and will be continuously updated.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Low-Dose CT Image Reconstruction by Domain and Task Shifting Gaussian Denoisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computed tomography from a low radiation dose (LDCT) is challenging due to high noise in the projection data. Popular approaches for LDCT image reconstruction are two-stage methods, typically consisting of the filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm followed by a neural network for LDCT image enhancement. Two-stage methods are attractive for their simplicity and potential for computational efficiency, typically requiring only a single FBP and a neural network forward pass for inference. However, the best reconstruction quality is currently achieved by unrolled iterative methods (Learned Primal-Dual and ItNet), which are more complex and thus have a higher computational cost for training and inference. We propose a method combining the simplicity and efficiency of two-stage methods with state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. Our strategy utilizes a neural network pretrained for Gaussian noise removal from natural grayscale images, fine-tuned for LDCT image enhancement. We call this method FBP-DTSGD (Domain and Task Shifted Gaussian Denoisers) as the fine-tuning is a task shift from Gaussian denoising to enhancing LDCT images and a domain shift from natural grayscale to LDCT images. An ablation study with three different pretrained Gaussian denoisers indicates that the performance of FBP-DTSGD does not depend on a specific denoising architecture, suggesting future advancements in Gaussian denoising could benefit the method. The study also shows that pretraining on natural images enhances LDCT reconstruction quality, especially with limited training data. Notably, pretraining involves no additional cost, as existing pretrained models are used. The proposed method currently holds the top mean position in the LoDoPaB-CT challenge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16970v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: As visual inspection is an inherent process during radiological screening, the associated eye gaze data can provide valuable insights into relevant clinical decisions. As deep learning has become the state-of-the-art for computer-assisted diagnosis, integrating human behavior, such as eye gaze data, into these systems is instrumental to help align machine predictions with clinical diagnostic criteria, thus enhancing the quality of automatic radiological diagnosis. Methods: We propose a novel deep learning framework for joint disease diagnosis and prediction of corresponding clinical visual attention maps for chest X-ray scans. Specifically, we introduce a new dual-encoder multi-task UNet, which leverages both a DenseNet201 backbone and a Residual and Squeeze-and-Excitation block-based encoder to extract diverse features for visual attention map prediction, and a multi-scale feature-fusion classifier to perform disease classification. To tackle the issue of asynchronous training schedules of individual tasks in multi-task learning, we proposed a multi-stage cooperative learning strategy, with contrastive learning for feature encoder pretraining to boost performance. Results: Our proposed method is shown to significantly outperform existing techniques for chest X-ray diagnosis (AUC=0.93) and the quality of visual attention map prediction (Correlation coefficient=0.58). Conclusion: Benefiting from the proposed multi-task multi-stage cooperative learning, our technique demonstrates the benefit of integrating clinicians' eye gaze into clinical AI systems to boost performance and potentially explainability.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Artificial Intelligence in Gait-Based Neurodegenerative Disease Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing global population affected by neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), which traditionally require extensive healthcare resources and human effort for medical diagnosis and monitoring. As a crucial disease-related motor symptom, human gait can be exploited to characterize different NDs. The current advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models enable automatic gait analysis for NDs identification and classification, opening a new avenue to facilitate faster and more cost-effective diagnosis of NDs. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on recent progress of machine learning and deep learning based AI techniques applied to diagnosis of five typical NDs through gait. We provide an overview of the process of AI-assisted NDs diagnosis, and present a systematic taxonomy of existing gait data and AI models. Meanwhile, a novel quality evaluation criterion is proposed to quantitatively assess the quality of existing studies. Through an extensive review and analysis of 169 studies, we present recent technical advancements, discuss existing challenges, potential solutions, and future directions in this field. Finally, we envision the prospective utilization of 3D skeleton data for human gait representation and the development of more efficient AI models for NDs diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Understand Symbolic Graphics Programs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08313v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Against the backdrop of enthusiasm for large language models (LLMs), there is an urgent need to scientifically assess their capabilities and shortcomings. This is nontrivial in part because it is difficult to find tasks which the models have not encountered during training. Utilizing symbolic graphics programs, we propose a domain well-suited to test multiple spatial-semantic reasoning skills of LLMs. Popular in computer graphics, these programs procedurally generate visual data. While LLMs exhibit impressive skills in general program synthesis and analysis, symbolic graphics programs offer a new layer of evaluation: they allow us to test an LLM's ability to answer different-grained semantic-level questions of the images or 3D geometries without a vision encoder. To semantically understand the symbolic programs, LLMs would need to possess the ability to "imagine" and reason how the corresponding graphics content would look with only the symbolic description. We use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the semantic visual understanding of symbolic graphics programs, built procedurally with minimal human effort. Particular emphasis is placed on transformations of images that leave the image level semantics invariant while introducing significant changes to the underlying program. We evaluate commercial and open-source LLMs on our benchmark to assess their ability to reason about visual output of programs, finding that LLMs considered stronger at reasoning generally perform better. Lastly, we introduce a novel method to improve this ability -- Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT), in which the LLM is finetuned with pre-collected instruction data on symbolic graphics programs. Interestingly, we find that SIT not only improves LLM's understanding on symbolic programs, but it also improves general reasoning ability on various other benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Good Grasps Only: A data engine for self-supervised fine-tuning of pose estimation using grasp poses for verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel method for self-supervised fine-tuning of pose estimation. Leveraging zero-shot pose estimation, our approach enables the robot to automatically obtain training data without manual labeling. After pose estimation the object is grasped, and in-hand pose estimation is used for data validation. Our pipeline allows the system to fine-tune while the process is running, removing the need for a learning phase. The motivation behind our work lies in the need for rapid setup of pose estimation solutions. Specifically, we address the challenging task of bin picking, which plays a pivotal role in flexible robotic setups. Our method is implemented on a robotics work-cell, and tested with four different objects. For all objects, our method increases the performance and outperforms a state-of-the-art method trained on the CAD model of the objects. Project page available at gogoengine.github.io</description>

      <title>Localizing Memorization in SSL Vision Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work on studying memorization in self-supervised learning (SSL) suggests that even though SSL encoders are trained on millions of images, they still memorize individual data points. While effort has been put into characterizing the memorized data and linking encoder memorization to downstream utility, little is known about where the memorization happens inside SSL encoders. To close this gap, we propose two metrics for localizing memorization in SSL encoders on a per-layer (layermem) and per-unit basis (unitmem). Our localization methods are independent of the downstream task, do not require any label information, and can be performed in a forward pass. By localizing memorization in various encoder architectures (convolutional and transformer-based) trained on diverse datasets with contrastive and non-contrastive SSL frameworks, we find that (1) while SSL memorization increases with layer depth, highly memorizing units are distributed across the entire encoder, (2) a significant fraction of units in SSL encoders experiences surprisingly high memorization of individual data points, which is in contrast to models trained under supervision, (3) atypical (or outlier) data points cause much higher layer and unit memorization than standard data points, and (4) in vision transformers, most memorization happens in the fully-connected layers. Finally, we show that localizing memorization in SSL has the potential to improve fine-tuning and to inform pruning strategies.</description>

      <title>CAS-GAN for Contrast-free Angiography Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Iodinated contrast agents are widely utilized in numerous interventional procedures, yet posing substantial health risks to patients. This paper presents CAS-GAN, a novel GAN framework that serves as a "virtual contrast agent" to synthesize X-ray angiographies via disentanglement representation learning and vessel semantic guidance, thereby reducing the reliance on iodinated contrast agents during interventional procedures. Specifically, our approach disentangles X-ray angiographies into background and vessel components, leveraging medical prior knowledge. A specialized predictor then learns to map the interrelationships between these components. Additionally, a vessel semantic-guided generator and a corresponding loss function are introduced to enhance the visual fidelity of generated images. Experimental results on the XCAD dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our CAS-GAN, achieving a FID of 5.87 and a MMD of 0.016. These promising results highlight {\tt CAS-GAN}'s potential for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Unpacking SDXL Turbo: Interpreting Text-to-Image Models with Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a core ingredient in the reverse engineering of large-language models (LLMs). For LLMs, they have been shown to decompose intermediate representations that often are not interpretable directly into sparse sums of interpretable features, facilitating better control and subsequent analysis. However, similar analyses and approaches have been lacking for text-to-image models. We investigated the possibility of using SAEs to learn interpretable features for a few-step text-to-image diffusion models, such as SDXL Turbo. To this end, we train SAEs on the updates performed by transformer blocks within SDXL Turbo's denoising U-net. We find that their learned features are interpretable, causally influence the generation process, and reveal specialization among the blocks. In particular, we find one block that deals mainly with image composition, one that is mainly responsible for adding local details, and one for color, illumination, and style. Therefore, our work is an important first step towards better understanding the internals of generative text-to-image models like SDXL Turbo and showcases the potential of features learned by SAEs for the visual domain.

      <title>Golden Noise for Diffusion Models: A Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion model is a popular paradigm that synthesizes personalized images by providing a text prompt and a random Gaussian noise. While people observe that some noises are ``golden noises'' that can achieve better text-image alignment and higher human preference than others, we still lack a machine learning framework to obtain those golden noises. To learn golden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in this paper. First, we identify a new concept termed the \textit{noise prompt}, which aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a small desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt. Following the concept, we first formulate the \textit{noise prompt learning} framework that systematically learns ``prompted'' golden noise associated with a text prompt for diffusion models. Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline and collect a large-scale \textit{noise prompt dataset}~(NPD) that contains 100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts. With the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small \textit{noise prompt network}~(NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise into a golden noise. The learned golden noise perturbation can be considered as a kind of prompt for noise, as it is rich in semantic information and tailored to the given text prompt. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive effectiveness and generalization of NPNet on improving the quality of synthesized images across various diffusion models, including SDXL, DreamShaper-xl-v2-turbo, and Hunyuan-DiT. Moreover, NPNet is a small and efficient controller that acts as a plug-and-play module with very limited additional inference and computational costs, as it just provides a golden noise instead of a random noise without accessing the original pipeline.</description>

      <title>Perturb and Recover: Fine-tuning for Effective Backdoor Removal from CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language models like CLIP have been shown to be highly effective at linking visual perception and natural language understanding, enabling sophisticated image-text capabilities, including strong retrieval and zero-shot classification performance. Their widespread use, as well as the fact that CLIP models are trained on image-text pairs from the web, make them both a worthwhile and relatively easy target for backdoor attacks. As training foundational models, such as CLIP, from scratch is very expensive, this paper focuses on cleaning potentially poisoned models via fine-tuning. We first show that existing cleaning techniques are not effective against simple structured triggers used in Blended or BadNet backdoor attacks, exposing a critical vulnerability for potential real-world deployment of these models. Then, we introduce PAR, Perturb and Recover, a surprisingly simple yet effective mechanism to remove backdoors from CLIP models. Through extensive experiments across different encoders and types of backdoor attacks, we show that PAR achieves high backdoor removal rate while preserving good standard performance. Finally, we illustrate that our approach is effective even only with synthetic text-image pairs, i.e. without access to real training data.

      <title>Generalized Least Squares Kernelized Tensor Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world datasets often contain missing or corrupted values. Completing multidimensional tensor-structured data with missing entries is essential for numerous applications. Smoothness-constrained low-rank factorization models have shown superior performance with reduced computational costs. While effective at capturing global and long-range correlations, these models struggle to reproduce short-scale, high-frequency variations in the data. In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Least Squares Kernelized Tensor Factorization (GLSKF) framework for tensor completion. GLSKF integrates smoothness-constrained low-rank factorization with a locally correlated residual process; the resulting additive structure can effectively characterize both global dependencies and local variations. In particular, we define the covariance norm to enforce the smoothness of factor matrices in the global low-rank factorization, and use structured covariance/kernel functions to model the local processes. For model estimation, we develop an alternating least squares (ALS) procedure with closed-form solutions for each subproblem. To efficiently handle missing data, GLSKF utilizes projection matrices that preserve the Kronecker structure of covariances, facilitating fast computations through conjugate gradient (CG) and preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithms. The proposed framework is evaluated on four real-world datasets across diverse tasks: traffic speed imputation, color image inpainting, video completion, and MRI image reconstruction. Experimental results confirm that GLSKF delivers superior effectiveness and scalability, establishing it as a robust solution for multidimensional tensor completion.</description>

Abstract: Sewing patterns, the essential blueprints for fabric cutting and tailoring, act as a crucial bridge between design concepts and producible garments. However, existing uni-modal sewing pattern generation models struggle to effectively encode complex design concepts with a multi-modal nature and correlate them with vectorized sewing patterns that possess precise geometric structures and intricate sewing relations. In this work, we propose a novel sewing pattern generation approach Design2GarmentCode based on Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), to generate parametric pattern-making programs from multi-modal design concepts. LMM offers an intuitive interface for interpreting diverse design inputs, while pattern-making programs could serve as well-structured and semantically meaningful representations of sewing patterns, and act as a robust bridge connecting the cross-domain pattern-making knowledge embedded in LMMs with vectorized sewing patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can flexibly handle various complex design expressions such as images, textual descriptions, designer sketches, or their combinations, and convert them into size-precise sewing patterns with correct stitches. Compared to previous methods, our approach significantly enhances training efficiency, generation quality, and authoring flexibility. Our code and data will be publicly available.</description>
