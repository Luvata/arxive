      <title>ULLME: A Unified Framework for Large Language Model Embeddings with Generation-Augmented Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various natural language processing tasks, but leveraging them for dense passage embedding remains challenging. This is due to their causal attention mechanism and the misalignment between their pre-training objectives and the text ranking tasks. Despite some recent efforts to address these issues, existing frameworks for LLM-based text embeddings have been limited by their support for only a limited range of LLM architectures and fine-tuning strategies, limiting their practical application and versatility. In this work, we introduce the Unified framework for Large Language Model Embedding (ULLME), a flexible, plug-and-play implementation that enables bidirectional attention across various LLMs and supports a range of fine-tuning strategies. We also propose Generation-augmented Representation Learning (GRL), a novel fine-tuning method to boost LLMs for text embedding tasks. GRL enforces consistency between representation-based and generation-based relevance scores, leveraging LLMs' powerful generative abilities for learning passage embeddings. To showcase our framework's flexibility and effectiveness, we release three pre-trained models from ULLME with different backbone architectures, ranging from 1.5B to 8B parameters, all of which demonstrate strong performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark. Our framework is publicly available at: https://github.com/nlp-uoregon/ullme. A demo video for ULLME can also be found at https://rb.gy/ws1ile.</description>

      <title>Logistic Regression makes small LLMs strong and explainable "tens-of-shot" classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For simple classification tasks, we show that users can benefit from the advantages of using small, local, generative language models instead of large commercial models without a trade-off in performance or introducing extra labelling costs. These advantages, including those around privacy, availability, cost, and explainability, are important both in commercial applications and in the broader democratisation of AI. Through experiments on 17 sentence classification tasks (2-4 classes), we show that penalised logistic regression on the embeddings from a small LLM equals (and usually betters) the performance of a large LLM in the "tens-of-shot" regime. This requires no more labelled instances than are needed to validate the performance of the large LLM. Finally, we extract stable and sensible explanations for classification decisions.</description>

      <title>Optimus: Accelerating Large-Scale Multi-Modal LLM Training by Bubble Exploitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have extended the success of large language models (LLMs) to multiple data types, such as image, text and audio, achieving significant performance in various domains, including multimodal translation, visual question answering and content generation. Nonetheless, existing systems are inefficient to train MLLMs due to substantial GPU bubbles caused by the heterogeneous modality models and complex data dependencies in 3D parallelism. This paper proposes Optimus, a distributed MLLM training system that reduces end-to-end MLLM training time. Optimus is based on our principled analysis that scheduling the encoder computation within the LLM bubbles can reduce bubbles in MLLM training. To make scheduling encoder computation possible for all GPUs, Optimus searches the separate parallel plans for encoder and LLM, and adopts a bubble scheduling algorithm to enable exploiting LLM bubbles without breaking the original data dependencies in the MLLM model architecture. We further decompose encoder layer computation into a series of kernels, and analyze the common bubble pattern of 3D parallelism to carefully optimize the sub-millisecond bubble scheduling, minimizing the overall training time. Our experiments in a production cluster show that Optimus accelerates MLLM training by 20.5%-21.3% with ViT-22B and GPT-175B model over 3072 GPUs compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>1.5-Pints Technical Report: Pretraining in Days, Not Months -- Your Language Model Thrives on Quality Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a compute-efficient approach to pre-training a Language Model-the "1.5-Pints"-in only 9 days, while outperforming state-of-the-art models as an instruction-following assistant.Based on MT-Bench (a benchmark that emulates human judgments), 1.5-Pints outperforms Apple's OpenELM and Microsoft's Phi.This is achieved by a carefully curated pre-training dataset of 57 billion tokens, using a mix of automated workflows and manual human review. The selection of the dataset prioritizes content that is considered expository and "textbook-like" to aid the model in reasoning and logical deduction, culminating in its overall ability as a strong and versatile AI model. In terms of the model architecture, we employed a modified Mistral tokenizer, alongside a Llama-2 architecture for wider compatibility. For training, we adopted the methodologies used by StableLM, TinyLlama, and Huggingface Zephyr. 1.5-Pints demonstrates that by focusing on data quality over quantity in LLM training, we can significantly reduce training time and resources required. We believe this approach will not only make pre-training more accessible but also reduce our carbon footprint. Our findings and resources from this research are open-sourced, aiming to facilitate further advancements in the field. The 1.5-Pints model is available in two versions: 2K and 16K context windows.</description>

      <title>EgyBERT: A Large Language Model Pretrained on Egyptian Dialect Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents EgyBERT, an Arabic language model pretrained on 10.4 GB of Egyptian dialectal texts. We evaluated EgyBERT's performance by comparing it with five other multidialect Arabic language models across 10 evaluation datasets. EgyBERT achieved the highest average F1-score of 84.25% and an accuracy of 87.33%, significantly outperforming all other comparative models, with MARBERTv2 as the second best model achieving an F1-score 83.68% and an accuracy 87.19%. Additionally, we introduce two novel Egyptian dialectal corpora: the Egyptian Tweets Corpus (ETC), containing over 34.33 million tweets (24.89 million sentences) amounting to 2.5 GB of text, and the Egyptian Forums Corpus (EFC), comprising over 44.42 million sentences (7.9 GB of text) collected from various Egyptian online forums. Both corpora are used in pretraining the new model, and they are the largest Egyptian dialectal corpora to date reported in the literature. Furthermore, this is the first study to evaluate the performance of various language models on Egyptian dialect datasets, revealing significant differences in performance that highlight the need for more dialect-specific models. The results confirm the effectiveness of EgyBERT model in processing and analyzing Arabic text expressed in Egyptian dialect, surpassing other language models included in the study. EgyBERT model is publicly available on \url{https://huggingface.co/faisalq/EgyBERT}.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Non-Native Language Context Limitation: Native Language Prompting Facilitates Knowledge Elicitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual large language models (MLLMs) struggle to answer questions posed in non-dominant languages, even though they have already acquired the relevant knowledge from their dominant language corpus. In contrast, human multilinguals can overcome this issue by invoking the relatively rich knowledge acquired from native language texts through Positive Native Language Transfer (PNLT). Inspired by this, we analogize the dominant language of MLLMs to the native language of human multilinguals, and propose Native Language Prompting (NatLan) to simulate the PNLT observed in human multilinguals. It explicitly creates native language contexts for MLLMs to facilitate the elicitation of the rich native language knowledge during question-answering, unlocking the limitations imposed by non-native language contexts on the effective application of knowledge. By employing multi-MLLM collaboration, NatLan reduces the workload on each MLLM in simulating PNLT and refines semantic transfer. On the C-Eval benchmark, NatLan provides up to a 10.1% average accuracy improvement and up to a 5.0% increase in the hard-level subset across five MLLMs, surpassing all top-notch related methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/AnonyNLP/NatLan.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis of Large Vision-Language Models against Goal Hijacking via Visual Prompt Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore visual prompt injection (VPI) that maliciously exploits the ability of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to follow instructions drawn onto the input image. We propose a new VPI method, "goal hijacking via visual prompt injection" (GHVPI), that swaps the execution task of LVLMs from an original task to an alternative task designated by an attacker. The quantitative analysis indicates that GPT-4V is vulnerable to the GHVPI and demonstrates a notable attack success rate of 15.8%, which is an unignorable security risk. Our analysis also shows that successful GHVPI requires high character recognition capability and instruction-following ability in LVLMs.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of LLM Finetuning Methods &amp; Evaluation Metrics with Travel Chatbot Use Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research compares large language model (LLM) fine-tuning methods, including Quantized Low Rank Adapter (QLoRA), Retrieval Augmented fine-tuning (RAFT), and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and additionally compared LLM evaluation methods including End to End (E2E) benchmark method of "Golden Answers", traditional natural language processing (NLP) metrics, RAG Assessment (Ragas), OpenAI GPT-4 evaluation metrics, and human evaluation, using the travel chatbot use case. The travel dataset was sourced from the the Reddit API by requesting posts from travel-related subreddits to get travel-related conversation prompts and personalized travel experiences, and augmented for each fine-tuning method. We used two pretrained LLMs utilized for fine-tuning research: LLaMa 2 7B, and Mistral 7B. QLoRA and RAFT are applied to the two pretrained models. The inferences from these models are extensively evaluated against the aforementioned metrics. The best model according to human evaluation and some GPT-4 metrics was Mistral RAFT, so this underwent a Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) training pipeline, and ultimately was evaluated as the best model. Our main findings are that: 1) quantitative and Ragas metrics do not align with human evaluation, 2) Open AI GPT-4 evaluation most aligns with human evaluation, 3) it is essential to keep humans in the loop for evaluation because, 4) traditional NLP metrics insufficient, 5) Mistral generally outperformed LLaMa, 6) RAFT outperforms QLoRA, but still needs postprocessing, 7) RLHF improves model performance significantly. Next steps include improving data quality, increasing data quantity, exploring RAG methods, and focusing data collection on a specific city, which would improve data quality by narrowing the focus, while creating a useful product.</description>

      <title>Is Child-Directed Speech Effective Training Data for Language Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While high-performing language models are typically trained on hundreds of billions of words, human children become fluent language users with a much smaller amount of data. What are the features of the data they receive, and how do these features support language modeling objectives? To investigate this question, we train GPT-2 models on 29M words of English-language child-directed speech and a new matched, synthetic dataset (TinyDialogues), comparing to a heterogeneous blend of datasets from the BabyLM challenge. We evaluate both the syntactic and semantic knowledge of these models using developmentally-inspired evaluations. Through pretraining experiments, we test whether the global developmental ordering or the local discourse ordering of children's training data support high performance relative to other datasets. The local properties of the data affect model results, but somewhat surprisingly, global properties do not. Further, child language input is not uniquely valuable for training language models. These findings support the hypothesis that, rather than proceeding from better data, children's learning is instead substantially more efficient than current language modeling techniques.</description>

      <title>A Logical Fallacy-Informed Framework for Argument Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), they still struggle with generating logically sound arguments, resulting in potential risks such as spreading misinformation. An important factor contributing to LLMs' suboptimal performance in generating coherent arguments is their oversight of logical fallacies. To address this issue, we introduce FIPO, a fallacy-informed framework that leverages preference optimization methods to steer LLMs toward logically sound arguments. FIPO includes a classification loss, to capture the fine-grained information on fallacy categories. Our results on argumentation datasets show that our method reduces the fallacy errors by up to 17.5%. Furthermore, our human evaluation results indicate that the quality of the generated arguments by our method significantly outperforms the fine-tuned baselines, as well as prior preference optimization methods, such as DPO. These findings highlight the importance of ensuring models are aware of logical fallacies for effective argument generation.</description>

      <title>Improving the quality of Persian clinical text with a novel spelling correction system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The accuracy of spelling in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is a critical factor for efficient clinical care, research, and ensuring patient safety. The Persian language, with its abundant vocabulary and complex characteristics, poses unique challenges for real-word error correction. This research aimed to develop an innovative approach for detecting and correcting spelling errors in Persian clinical text.
  Methods: Our strategy employs a state-of-the-art pre-trained model that has been meticulously fine-tuned specifically for the task of spelling correction in the Persian clinical domain. This model is complemented by an innovative orthographic similarity matching algorithm, PERTO, which uses visual similarity of characters for ranking correction candidates.
  Results: The evaluation of our approach demonstrated its robustness and precision in detecting and rectifying word errors in Persian clinical text. In terms of non-word error correction, our model achieved an F1-Score of 90.0% when the PERTO algorithm was employed. For real-word error detection, our model demonstrated its highest performance, achieving an F1-Score of 90.6%. Furthermore, the model reached its highest F1-Score of 91.5% for real-word error correction when the PERTO algorithm was employed.
  Conclusions: Despite certain limitations, our method represents a substantial advancement in the field of spelling error detection and correction for Persian clinical text. By effectively addressing the unique challenges posed by the Persian language, our approach paves the way for more accurate and efficient clinical documentation, contributing to improved patient care and safety. Future research could explore its use in other areas of the Persian medical domain, enhancing its impact and utility.</description>

      <title>PAGED: A Benchmark for Procedural Graphs Extraction from Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic extraction of procedural graphs from documents creates a low-cost way for users to easily understand a complex procedure by skimming visual graphs. Despite the progress in recent studies, it remains unanswered: whether the existing studies have well solved this task (Q1) and whether the emerging large language models (LLMs) can bring new opportunities to this task (Q2). To this end, we propose a new benchmark PAGED, equipped with a large high-quality dataset and standard evaluations. It investigates five state-of-the-art baselines, revealing that they fail to extract optimal procedural graphs well because of their heavy reliance on hand-written rules and limited available data. We further involve three advanced LLMs in PAGED and enhance them with a novel self-refine strategy. The results point out the advantages of LLMs in identifying textual elements and their gaps in building logical structures. We hope PAGED can serve as a major landmark for automatic procedural graph extraction and the investigations in PAGED can offer insights into the research on logic reasoning among non-sequential elements.</description>

      <title>CARE: A Clue-guided Assistant for CSRs to Read User Manuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is time-saving to build a reading assistant for customer service representations (CSRs) when reading user manuals, especially information-rich ones. Current solutions don't fit the online custom service scenarios well due to the lack of attention to user questions and possible responses. Hence, we propose to develop a time-saving and careful reading assistant for CSRs, named CARE. It can help the CSRs quickly find proper responses from the user manuals via explicit clue chains. Specifically, each of the clue chains is formed by inferring over the user manuals, starting from the question clue aligned with the user question and ending at a possible response. To overcome the shortage of supervised data, we adopt the self-supervised strategy for model learning. The offline experiment shows that CARE is efficient in automatically inferring accurate responses from the user manual. The online experiment further demonstrates the superiority of CARE to reduce CSRs' reading burden and keep high service quality, in particular with &gt;35% decrease in time spent and keeping a &gt;0.75 ICC score.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to identify and classify entities in text into predefined categories. However, when applied to Arabic data, NER encounters unique challenges stemming from the language's rich morphological inflections, absence of capitalization cues, and spelling variants, where a single word can comprise multiple morphemes. In this paper, we introduce Arabic KNN-NER, our submission to the Wojood NER Shared Task 2024 (ArabicNLP 2024). We have participated in the shared sub-task 1 Flat NER. In this shared sub-task, we tackle fine-grained flat-entity recognition for Arabic text, where we identify a single main entity and possibly zero or multiple sub-entities for each word. Arabic KNN-NER augments the probability distribution of a fine-tuned model with another label probability distribution derived from performing a KNN search over the cached training data. Our submission achieved 91% on the test set on the WojoodFine dataset, placing Arabic KNN-NER on top of the leaderboard for the shared task.</description>

      <title>NACL: A General and Effective KV Cache Eviction Framework for LLMs at Inference Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have ignited an innovative surge of AI applications, marking a new era of exciting possibilities equipped with extended context windows. However, hosting these models is cost-prohibitive mainly due to the extensive memory consumption of KV Cache involving long-context modeling. Despite several works proposing to evict unnecessary tokens from the KV Cache, most of them rely on the biased local statistics of accumulated attention scores and report performance using unconvincing metric like perplexity on inadequate short-text evaluation. In this paper, we propose NACL, a general framework for long-context KV cache eviction that achieves more optimal and efficient eviction in a single operation during the encoding phase. Due to NACL's efficiency, we combine more accurate attention score statistics in PROXY TOKENS EVICTION with the diversified random eviction strategy of RANDOM EVICTION, aiming to alleviate the issue of attention bias and enhance the robustness in maintaining pivotal tokens for long-context modeling tasks. Notably, our method significantly improves the performance on short- and long-text tasks by 80% and 76% respectively, reducing KV Cache by up to 50% with over 95% performance maintenance.

      <title>Local Topology Measures of Contextual Language Model Latent Spaces With Applications to Dialogue Term Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common approach for sequence tagging tasks based on contextual word representations is to train a machine learning classifier directly on these embedding vectors. This approach has two shortcomings. First, such methods consider single input sequences in isolation and are unable to put an individual embedding vector in relation to vectors outside the current local context of use. Second, the high performance of these models relies on fine-tuning the embedding model in conjunction with the classifier, which may not always be feasible due to the size or inaccessibility of the underlying feature-generation model. It is thus desirable, given a collection of embedding vectors of a corpus, i.e., a datastore, to find features of each vector that describe its relation to other, similar vectors in the datastore. With this in mind, we introduce complexity measures of the local topology of the latent space of a contextual language model with respect to a given datastore. The effectiveness of our features is demonstrated through their application to dialogue term extraction. Our work continues a line of research that explores the manifold hypothesis for word embeddings, demonstrating that local structure in the space carved out by word embeddings can be exploited to infer semantic properties.</description>

      <title>Question Rephrasing for Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models: Applications in Molecular Chemistry Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification enables users to assess the reliability of responses generated by large language models (LLMs). We present a novel Question Rephrasing technique to evaluate the input uncertainty of LLMs, which refers to the uncertainty arising from equivalent variations of the inputs provided to LLMs. This technique is integrated with sampling methods that measure the output uncertainty of LLMs, thereby offering a more comprehensive uncertainty assessment. We validated our approach on property prediction and reaction prediction for molecular chemistry tasks.</description>

      <title>Generative Language Models with Retrieval Augmented Generation for Automated Short Answer Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Short Answer Scoring (ASAS) is a critical component in educational assessment. While traditional ASAS systems relied on rule-based algorithms or complex deep learning methods, recent advancements in Generative Language Models (GLMs) offer new opportunities for improvement. This study explores the application of GLMs to ASAS, leveraging their off-the-shelf capabilities and performance in various domains. We propose a novel pipeline that combines vector databases, transformer-based encoders, and GLMs to enhance short answer scoring accuracy. Our approach stores training responses in a vector database, retrieves semantically similar responses during inference, and employs a GLM to analyze these responses and determine appropriate scores. We further optimize the system through fine-tuned retrieval processes and prompt engineering. Evaluation on the SemEval 2013 dataset demonstrates a significant improvement on the SCIENTSBANK 3-way and 2-way tasks compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of GLMs in advancing ASAS technology.</description>

      <title>Hate Speech Detection and Classification in Amharic Text with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hate speech is a growing problem on social media. It can seriously impact society, especially in countries like Ethiopia, where it can trigger conflicts among diverse ethnic and religious groups. While hate speech detection in resource rich languages are progressing, for low resource languages such as Amharic are lacking. To address this gap, we develop Amharic hate speech data and SBi-LSTM deep learning model that can detect and classify text into four categories of hate speech: racial, religious, gender, and non-hate speech. We have annotated 5k Amharic social media post and comment data into four categories. The data is annotated using a custom annotation tool by a total of 100 native Amharic speakers. The model achieves a 94.8 F1-score performance. Future improvements will include expanding the dataset and develop state-of-the art models.

      <title>Why transformers are obviously good models of language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nobody knows how language works, but many theories abound. Transformers are a class of neural networks that process language automatically with more success than alternatives, both those based on neural computations and those that rely on other (e.g. more symbolic) mechanisms. Here, I highlight direct connections between the transformer architecture and certain theoretical perspectives on language. The empirical success of transformers relative to alternative models provides circumstantial evidence that the linguistic approaches that transformers embody should be, at least, evaluated with greater scrutiny by the linguistics community and, at best, considered to be the currently best available theories.</description>

      <title>BeeManc at the PLABA Track of TAC-2023: Investigating LLMs and Controllable Attributes for Improving Biomedical Text Readability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this system report, we describe the models and methods we used for our participation in the PLABA2023 task on biomedical abstract simplification, part of the TAC 2023 tracks. The system outputs we submitted come from the following three categories: 1) domain fine-tuned T5-like models including Biomedical-T5 and Lay-SciFive; 2) fine-tuned BARTLarge model with controllable attributes (via tokens) BART-w-CTs; 3) ChatGPTprompting. We also present the work we carried out for this task on BioGPT finetuning. In the official automatic evaluation using SARI scores, BeeManc ranks 2nd among all teams and our model LaySciFive ranks 3rd among all 13 evaluated systems. In the official human evaluation, our model BART-w-CTs ranks 2nd on Sentence-Simplicity (score 92.84), 3rd on Term-Simplicity (score 82.33) among all 7 evaluated systems; It also produced a high score 91.57 on Fluency in comparison to the highest score 93.53. In the second round of submissions, our team using ChatGPT-prompting ranks the 2nd in several categories including simplified term accuracy score 92.26 and completeness score 96.58, and a very similar score on faithfulness score 95.3 to re-evaluated PLABA-base-1 (95.73) via human evaluations.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel technique to improve the quality of draft clinical notes for physicians. This technique is concentrated on the ability to model implicit physician conversation styles and note preferences. We also introduce a novel technique for the enrollment of new physicians when a limited number of clinical notes paired with conversations are available for that physician, without the need to re-train a model to support them. We show that our technique outperforms the baseline model by improving the ROUGE-2 score of the History of Present Illness section by 13.8%, the Physical Examination section by 88.6%, and the Assessment &amp; Plan section by 50.8%.</description>

      <title>Simplifying Scholarly Abstracts for Accessible Digital Libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standing at the forefront of knowledge dissemination, digital libraries curate vast collections of scientific literature. However, these scholarly writings are often laden with jargon and tailored for domain experts rather than the general public. As librarians, we strive to offer services to a diverse audience, including those with lower reading levels. To extend our services beyond mere access, we propose fine-tuning a language model to rewrite scholarly abstracts into more comprehensible versions, thereby making scholarly literature more accessible when requested. We began by introducing a corpus specifically designed for training models to simplify scholarly abstracts. This corpus consists of over three thousand pairs of abstracts and significance statements from diverse disciplines. We then fine-tuned four language models using this corpus. The outputs from the models were subsequently examined both quantitatively for accessibility and semantic coherence, and qualitatively for language quality, faithfulness, and completeness. Our findings show that the resulting models can improve readability by over three grade levels, while maintaining fidelity to the original content. Although commercial state-of-the-art models still hold an edge, our models are much more compact, can be deployed locally in an affordable manner, and alleviate the privacy concerns associated with using commercial models. We envision this work as a step toward more inclusive and accessible libraries, improving our services for young readers and those without a college degree.</description>

      <title>Speech-MASSIVE: A Multilingual Speech Dataset for SLU and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Speech-MASSIVE, a multilingual Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) dataset comprising the speech counterpart for a portion of the MASSIVE textual corpus. Speech-MASSIVE covers 12 languages from different families and inherits from MASSIVE the annotations for the intent prediction and slot-filling tasks. Our extension is prompted by the scarcity of massively multilingual SLU datasets and the growing need for versatile speech datasets to assess foundation models (LLMs, speech encoders) across languages and tasks. We provide a multimodal, multitask, multilingual dataset and report SLU baselines using both cascaded and end-to-end architectures in various training scenarios (zero-shot, few-shot, and full fine-tune). Furthermore, we demonstrate the suitability of Speech-MASSIVE for benchmarking other tasks such as speech transcription, language identification, and speech translation. The dataset, models, and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/hlt-mt/Speech-MASSIVE</description>

      <title>Decoding Biases: Automated Methods and LLM Judges for Gender Bias Detection in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled at language understanding and generating human-level text. However, even with supervised training and human alignment, these LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks where malicious users can prompt the model to generate undesirable text. LLMs also inherently encode potential biases that can cause various harmful effects during interactions. Bias evaluation metrics lack standards as well as consensus and existing methods often rely on human-generated templates and annotations which are expensive and labor intensive. In this work, we train models to automatically create adversarial prompts to elicit biased responses from target LLMs. We present LLM- based bias evaluation metrics and also analyze several existing automatic evaluation methods and metrics. We analyze the various nuances of model responses, identify the strengths and weaknesses of model families, and assess where evaluation methods fall short. We compare these metrics to human evaluation and validate that the LLM-as-a-Judge metric aligns with human judgement on bias in response generation.</description>

      <title>From Words to Worth: Newborn Article Impact Prediction with LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the academic landscape expands, the challenge of efficiently identifying potentially high-impact articles among the vast number of newly published works becomes critical. This paper introduces a promising approach, leveraging the capabilities of fine-tuned LLMs to predict the future impact of newborn articles solely based on titles and abstracts. Moving beyond traditional methods heavily reliant on external information, the proposed method discerns the shared semantic features of highly impactful papers from a large collection of title-abstract and potential impact pairs. These semantic features are further utilized to regress an improved metric, TNCSI_SP, which has been endowed with value, field, and time normalization properties. Additionally, a comprehensive dataset has been constructed and released for fine-tuning the LLM, containing over 12,000 entries with corresponding titles, abstracts, and TNCSI_SP. The quantitative results, with an NDCG@20 of 0.901, demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting the impact of newborn articles when compared to competitive counterparts. Finally, we demonstrate a real-world application for predicting the impact of newborn journal articles to demonstrate its noteworthy practical value. Overall, our findings challenge existing paradigms and propose a shift towards a more content-focused prediction of academic impact, offering new insights for assessing newborn article impact.</description>

      <title>SLIM-RAFT: A Novel Fine-Tuning Approach to Improve Cross-Linguistic Performance for Mercosur Common Nomenclature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) has seen significant advancements with the advent of large language models (LLMs). However, substantial improvements are still needed for languages other than English, especially for specific domains like the applications of Mercosur Common Nomenclature (NCM), a Brazilian Harmonized System (HS). To address this gap, this study uses TeenyTineLLaMA, a foundational Portuguese LLM, as an LLM source to implement the NCM application processing. Additionally, a simplified Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) technique, termed SLIM-RAFT, is proposed for task-specific fine-tuning of LLMs. This approach retains the chain-of-thought (CoT) methodology for prompt development in a more concise and streamlined manner, utilizing brief and focused documents for training. The proposed model demonstrates an efficient and cost-effective alternative for fine-tuning smaller LLMs, significantly outperforming TeenyTineLLaMA and ChatGPT-4 in the same task. Although the research focuses on NCM applications, the methodology can be easily adapted for HS applications worldwide.</description>

      <title>miniCTX: Neural Theorem Proving with (Long-)Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce miniCTX, which tests a model's ability to prove formal mathematical theorems that depend on new definitions, lemmas, or other contextual information that was not observed during training. miniCTX contains theorems sourced from real Lean projects and textbooks, each associated with a context that can span tens of thousands of tokens. Models are tasked with proving a theorem given access to code from the theorem's repository, which contains context that is helpful or needed for the proof. As a baseline for miniCTX, we introduce file-tuning, a simple recipe that trains a model to generate a proof step conditioned on the preceding file contents. File-tuning substantially outperforms the traditional neural theorem proving approach that fine-tunes on states alone. Additionally, our file-tuned model improves performance on the standard miniF2F benchmark, achieving a pass rate of 33.61%, which is a new state-of-the-art for 1.3B parameter models. Alongside miniCTX, we offer ntp-toolkit for automatically extracting and annotating theorem proving data, making it easy to add new projects into miniCTX to ensure that contexts are not seen during training. miniCTX offers a challenging and realistic perspective on evaluating neural theorem provers.</description>

      <title>The Use of Large Language Models (LLM) for Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) in Cybercrime Forums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be used to analyze cyber threat intelligence (CTI) data from cybercrime forums, which contain extensive information and key discussions about emerging cyber threats. However, to date, the level of accuracy and efficiency of LLMs for such critical tasks has yet to be thoroughly evaluated. Hence, this study assesses the accuracy of an LLM system built on the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model [7] to extract CTI information. To do so, a random sample of 500 daily conversations from three cybercrime forums, XSS, Exploit.in, and RAMP, was extracted, and the LLM system was instructed to summarize the conversations and code 10 key CTI variables, such as whether a large organization and/or a critical infrastructure is being targeted. Then, two coders reviewed each conversation and evaluated whether the information extracted by the LLM was accurate. The LLM system performed strikingly well, with an average accuracy score of 98%. Various ways to enhance the model were uncovered, such as the need to help the LLM distinguish between stories and past events, as well as being careful with verb tenses in prompts. Nevertheless, the results of this study highlight the efficiency and relevance of using LLMs for cyber threat intelligence.</description>

      <title>LAMPO: Large Language Models as Preference Machines for Few-shot Ordinal Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LAMPO, a novel paradigm that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for solving few-shot multi-class ordinal classification tasks. Unlike conventional methods, which concatenate all demonstration examples with the test instance and prompt LLMs to produce the pointwise prediction, our framework uses the LLM as a preference machine that makes a relative comparative decision between the test instance and each demonstration. A self-supervised method is then introduced to aggregate these binary comparisons into the final ordinal decision. LAMPO addresses several limitations inherent in previous methods, including context length constraints, ordering biases, and challenges associated with absolute point-wise estimation. Extensive experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate LAMPO's remarkably competitive performance across a diverse spectrum of applications (e.g., movie review analysis and hate speech detection). Notably, in certain applications, the improvement can be substantial, exceeding 20% in an absolute term. Moreover, we believe LAMPO represents an interesting addition to the non-parametric application layered on top of LLMs, as it supports black-box LLMs without necessitating the outputting of LLM's internal states (e.g., embeddings), as seen in previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Automated Theorem Provers Help Improve Large Language Model Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate how logic programming systems and Automated first-order logic Theorem Provers (ATPs) can improve the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) for logical reasoning tasks where the baseline performance is given by direct LLM solutions. We first evaluate LLM reasoning on steamroller problems using the PRONTOQA benchmark. We show how accuracy can be improved with a neuro-symbolic architecture where the LLM acts solely as a front-end for translating a given problem into a formal logic language and an automated reasoning engine is called for solving it. However, this approach critically hinges on the correctness of the LLM translation. To assess this translation correctness, we secondly define a framework of syntactic and semantic error categories. We implemented the framework and used it to identify errors that LLMs make in the benchmark domain. Based on these findings, we thirdly extended our method with capabilities for automatically correcting syntactic and semantic errors. For semantic error correction we integrate first-order logic ATPs, which is our main and novel contribution. We demonstrate that this approach reduces semantic errors significantly and further increases the accurracy of LLM logical reasoning.</description>

      <title>MoExtend: Tuning New Experts for Modality and Task Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in various tasks but are primarily trained on text data, limiting their application scope. Expanding LLM capabilities to include vision-language understanding is vital, yet training them on multimodal data from scratch is challenging and costly. Existing instruction tuning methods, e.g., LLAVA, often connects a pretrained CLIP vision encoder and LLMs via fully fine-tuning LLMs to bridge the modality gap. However, full fine-tuning is plagued by catastrophic forgetting, i.e., forgetting previous knowledge, and high training costs particularly in the era of increasing tasks and modalities. To solve this issue, we introduce MoExtend, an effective framework designed to streamline the modality adaptation and extension of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. MoExtend seamlessly integrates new experts into pre-trained MoE models, endowing them with novel knowledge without the need to tune pretrained models such as MoE and vision encoders. This approach enables rapid adaptation and extension to new modal data or tasks, effectively addressing the challenge of accommodating new modalities within LLMs. Furthermore, MoExtend avoids tuning pretrained models, thus mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of MoExtend in enhancing the multimodal capabilities of LLMs, contributing to advancements in multimodal AI research.

      <title>Unlocking Exocentric Video-Language Data for Egocentric Video Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present EMBED (Egocentric Models Built with Exocentric Data), a method designed to transform exocentric video-language data for egocentric video representation learning. Large-scale exocentric data covers diverse activities with significant potential for egocentric learning, but inherent disparities between egocentric and exocentric data pose challenges in utilizing one view for the other seamlessly. Egocentric videos predominantly feature close-up hand-object interactions, whereas exocentric videos offer a broader perspective on human activities. Additionally, narratives in egocentric datasets are typically more action-centric and closely linked with the visual content, in contrast to the narrative styles found in exocentric datasets. To address these challenges, we employ a data transformation framework to adapt exocentric data for egocentric training, focusing on identifying specific video clips that emphasize hand-object interactions and transforming narration styles to align with egocentric perspectives. By applying both vision and language style transfer, our framework creates a new egocentric dataset derived from exocentric video-language data. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of EMBED, achieving state-of-the-art results across various egocentric downstream tasks, including an absolute improvement of 4.7% on the Epic-Kitchens-100 multi-instance retrieval and 6.2% on the EGTEA classification benchmarks in zero-shot settings. Furthermore, EMBED enables egocentric video-language models to perform competitively in exocentric tasks. Finally, we showcase EMBED's application across various exocentric datasets, exhibiting strong generalization capabilities when applied to different exocentric datasets.</description>

      <title>Active Testing of Large Language Model via Multi-Stage Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performance evaluation plays a crucial role in the development life cycle of large language models (LLMs). It estimates the model's capability, elucidates behavior characteristics, and facilitates the identification of potential issues and limitations, thereby guiding further improvement. Given that LLMs' diverse task-handling abilities stem from large volumes of training data, a comprehensive evaluation also necessitates abundant, well-annotated, and representative test data to assess LLM performance across various downstream tasks. However, the demand for high-quality test data often entails substantial time, computational resources, and manual efforts, sometimes causing the evaluation to be inefficient or impractical. To address these challenges, researchers propose active testing, which estimates the overall performance by selecting a subset of test data. Nevertheless, the existing active testing methods tend to be inefficient, even inapplicable, given the unique new challenges of LLMs (e.g., diverse task types, increased model complexity, and unavailability of training data). To mitigate such limitations and expedite the development cycle of LLMs, in this work, we introduce AcTracer, an active testing framework tailored for LLMs that strategically selects a small subset of test data to achieve a nearly optimal performance estimation for LLMs. AcTracer utilizes both internal and external information from LLMs to guide the test sampling process, reducing variance through a multi-stage pool-based active selection. Our experiment results demonstrate that AcTracer achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods across various tasks, with up to 38.83% improvement over previous SOTA.</description>

      <title>Teach CLIP to Develop a Number Sense for Ordinal Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ordinal regression is a fundamental problem within the field of computer vision, with customised well-trained models on specific tasks. While pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive performance on various vision tasks, their potential for ordinal regression has received less exploration. In this study, we first investigate CLIP's potential for ordinal regression, from which we expect the model could generalise to different ordinal regression tasks and scenarios. Unfortunately, vanilla CLIP fails on this task, since current VLMs have a well-documented limitation of encapsulating compositional concepts such as number sense. We propose a simple yet effective method called NumCLIP to improve the quantitative understanding of VLMs. We disassemble the exact image to number-specific text matching problem into coarse classification and fine prediction stages. We discretize and phrase each numerical bin with common language concept to better leverage the available pre-trained alignment in CLIP. To consider the inherent continuous property of ordinal regression, we propose a novel fine-grained cross-modal ranking-based regularisation loss specifically designed to keep both semantic and ordinal alignment in CLIP's feature space. Experimental results on three general ordinal regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of NumCLIP, with 10% and 3.83% accuracy improvement on historical image dating and image aesthetics assessment task, respectively. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/NumCLIP.</description>

      <title>EnJa: Ensemble Jailbreak on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in safety-critical applications, their vulnerability to potential jailbreaks -- malicious prompts that can disable the safety mechanism of LLMs -- has attracted growing research attention. While alignment methods have been proposed to protect LLMs from jailbreaks, many have found that aligned LLMs can still be jailbroken by carefully crafted malicious prompts, producing content that violates policy regulations. Existing jailbreak attacks on LLMs can be categorized into prompt-level methods which make up stories/logic to circumvent safety alignment and token-level attack methods which leverage gradient methods to find adversarial tokens. In this work, we introduce the concept of Ensemble Jailbreak and explore methods that can integrate prompt-level and token-level jailbreak into a more powerful hybrid jailbreak attack. Specifically, we propose a novel EnJa attack to hide harmful instructions using prompt-level jailbreak, boost the attack success rate using a gradient-based attack, and connect the two types of jailbreak attacks via a template-based connector. We evaluate the effectiveness of EnJa on several aligned models and show that it achieves a state-of-the-art attack success rate with fewer queries and is much stronger than any individual jailbreak.</description>

      <title>Optimus-1: Hybrid Multimodal Memory Empowered Agents Excel in Long-Horizon Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building a general-purpose agent is a long-standing vision in the field of artificial intelligence. Existing agents have made remarkable progress in many domains, yet they still struggle to complete long-horizon tasks in an open world. We attribute this to the lack of necessary world knowledge and multimodal experience that can guide agents through a variety of long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Multimodal Memory module to address the above challenges. It 1) transforms knowledge into Hierarchical Directed Knowledge Graph that allows agents to explicitly represent and learn world knowledge, and 2) summarises historical information into Abstracted Multimodal Experience Pool that provide agents with rich references for in-context learning. On top of the Hybrid Multimodal Memory module, a multimodal agent, Optimus-1, is constructed with dedicated Knowledge-guided Planner and Experience-Driven Reflector, contributing to a better planning and reflection in the face of long-horizon tasks in Minecraft. Extensive experimental results show that Optimus-1 significantly outperforms all existing agents on challenging long-horizon task benchmarks, and exhibits near human-level performance on many tasks. In addition, we introduce various Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as the backbone of Optimus-1. Experimental results show that Optimus-1 exhibits strong generalization with the help of the Hybrid Multimodal Memory module, outperforming the GPT-4V baseline on many tasks.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Base Station Siting: Intelligent Deployment based on Prompt or Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional base station siting (BSS) methods rely heavily on drive testing and user feedback, which are laborious and require extensive expertise in communication, networking, and optimization. As large language models (LLMs) and their associated technologies advance, particularly in the realms of prompt engineering and agent engineering, network optimization will witness a revolutionary approach. This approach entails the strategic use of well-crafted prompts to infuse human experience and knowledge into these sophisticated LLMs, and the deployment of autonomous agents as a communication bridge to seamlessly connect the machine language based LLMs with human users using natural language. This integration represents the future paradigm of artificial intelligence (AI) as a service and AI for more ease. As a preliminary exploration, this research first develops a novel LLM-empowered BSS optimization framework, and heuristically proposes four different potential implementations: the strategies based on Prompt-optimized LLM (PoL), human-in-the-Loop LLM (HiLL), LLM-empowered autonomous BSS agent (LaBa), and Cooperative multiple LLM-based autonomous BSS agents (CLaBa). Through evaluation on real-world data, the experiments demonstrate that prompt-assisted LLMs and LLM-based agents can generate more efficient, cost-effective, and reliable network deployments, noticeably enhancing the efficiency of BSS optimization and reducing trivial manual participation.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Variation Theory in Counterfactual Data Augmentation for Optimized Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active Learning (AL) allows models to learn interactively from user feedback. This paper introduces a counterfactual data augmentation approach to AL, particularly addressing the selection of datapoints for user querying, a pivotal concern in enhancing data efficiency. Our approach is inspired by Variation Theory, a theory of human concept learning that emphasizes the essential features of a concept by focusing on what stays the same and what changes. Instead of just querying with existing datapoints, our approach synthesizes artificial datapoints that highlight potential key similarities and differences among labels using a neuro-symbolic pipeline combining large language models (LLMs) and rule-based models. Through an experiment in the example domain of text classification, we show that our approach achieves significantly higher performance when there are fewer annotated data. As the annotated training data gets larger the impact of the generated data starts to diminish showing its capability to address the cold start problem in AL. This research sheds light on integrating theories of human learning into the optimization of AL.</description>

      <title>CodexGraph: Bridging Large Language Models and Code Repositories via Code Graph Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in stand-alone code tasks like HumanEval and MBPP, but struggle with handling entire code repositories. This challenge has prompted research on enhancing LLM-codebase interaction at a repository scale. Current solutions rely on similarity-based retrieval or manual tools and APIs, each with notable drawbacks. Similarity-based retrieval often has low recall in complex tasks, while manual tools and APIs are typically task-specific and require expert knowledge, reducing their generalizability across diverse code tasks and real-world applications. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce \framework, a system that integrates LLM agents with graph database interfaces extracted from code repositories. By leveraging the structural properties of graph databases and the flexibility of the graph query language, \framework enables the LLM agent to construct and execute queries, allowing for precise, code structure-aware context retrieval and code navigation. We assess \framework using three benchmarks: CrossCodeEval, SWE-bench, and EvoCodeBench. Additionally, we develop five real-world coding applications. With a unified graph database schema, \framework demonstrates competitive performance and potential in both academic and real-world environments, showcasing its versatility and efficacy in software engineering. Our application demo: https://github.com/modelscope/modelscope-agent/tree/master/apps/codexgraph_agent.</description>

      <title>CA-LoRA: Adapting Existing LoRA for Compressed LLMs to Enable Efficient Multi-Tasking on Personal Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a demand to deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) on personal devices such as laptops and smartphones. These LLMs have different model variants when handling different tasks. However, personal devices have limited resources and require reduced storage overhead. To address this, there are two key methods available: the first is model compression, which compresses LLMs into smaller sizes; the second is LoRA, which can transfer an LLM to other tasks with very few parameters, avoiding the storage of multiple model variants in multi-task scenarios by only preserving LoRAs. However, our experiments show that directly combining these two methods yields sub-optimal performance. Considering that the open-source community has already contributed many LoRAs to LLMs, we propose to adapt these existing LoRAs from the LLMs to their compressed version and introduce a Compression-Aware LoRA (CA-LoRA) framework. We incorporate knowledge inheritance and recovery strategies to recover the lost knowledge caused by model compression. Experiment results demonstrate that CA-LoRA outperforms the vanilla LoRA methods applied to a compressed LLM and achieves comparable performance to the non-compressed LLM with existing LoRA modules. The source code of CA-LoRA is available at https://github.com/thunlp/CA-LoRA.</description>

      <title>Guiding Language Model Reasoning with Planning Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05707v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently attracted considerable interest for their ability to perform complex reasoning tasks, such as chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, most of the existing approaches to enhance this ability rely heavily on data-driven methods, while neglecting the structural aspects of the model's reasoning capacity. To encourage a more structural generation of CoT steps, we propose a hierarchical generation scheme: we let the LM generate a planning token at the start of each reasoning step, intuitively serving as a high-level plan of the current step, and add their embeddings to the model parameters. Our approach requires a negligible increase in trainable parameters (0.001%) and can be applied through either full fine-tuning or a more parameter-efficient scheme. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness by applying it to three different LLMs, showing notable accuracy improvements across three math word problem datasets and one multihop QA dataset with respect to standard fine-tuning baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01185v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this technical note we suggest a novel approach to discover temporal (related and unrelated to language dilation) and personality (authorship attribution) in historical datasets. We exemplify our approach on the State of the Union speeches given by the past 42 US presidents: this dataset is known for its relatively small amount of data, and high variability of the amount and style of texts. Nevertheless we manage to achieve about 95\% accuracy on the authorship attribution task, and pin down the date of writing to a single presidential term.</description>

      <title>I am a Strange Dataset: Metalinguistic Tests for Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statements involving metalinguistic self-reference ("This paper has six sections.") are prevalent in many domains. Can current large language models (LLMs) handle such language? In this paper, we present "I am a Strange Dataset", a new dataset for addressing this question. There are two subtasks: generation and verification. In generation, models continue statements like "The penultimate word in this sentence is" (where a correct continuation is "is"). In verification, models judge the truth of statements like "The penultimate word in this sentence is sentence." (false). We also provide minimally different metalinguistic non-self-reference examples to complement the main dataset by probing for whether models can handle metalinguistic language at all. The dataset is hand-crafted by experts and validated by non-expert annotators. We test a variety of open-source LLMs (7B to 70B parameters) as well as closed-source LLMs through APIs. All models perform close to chance across both subtasks and even on the non-self-referential metalinguistic control data, though we find some steady improvement with model scale. GPT 4 is the only model to consistently do significantly better than chance, and it is still only in the 60% range, while our untrained human annotators score well in the 89-93% range. The dataset and evaluation toolkit are available at https://github.com/TristanThrush/i-am-a-strange-dataset.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Emotional Generation Capability of Large Language Models via Emotional Chain-of-Thought</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various emotion recognition tasks, thereby piquing the research community's curiosity for exploring their potential in emotional intelligence. However, several issues in the field of emotional generation tasks remain unresolved, including human preference alignment and emotional generation assessment. In this paper, we propose the Emotional Chain-of-Thought (ECoT), a plug-and-play prompting method that enhances the performance of LLMs on various emotional generation tasks by aligning with human emotional intelligence guidelines. To assess the reliability of ECoT, we propose an automated model-based evaluation method called Emotional Generation Score (EGS). EGS incorporates Goleman's Emotional Intelligence Theory as a consensus of human experts, providing a new perspective on the evaluation of emotional generation tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ECoT and EGS. Further, we discuss the promise of LLMs in the field of emotional intelligence and present key insights into the LLMs with the ECoT in emotional generation tasks.</description>

      <title>AmbigNLG: Addressing Task Ambiguity in Instruction for NLG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce AmbigNLG, a new task designed to tackle the challenge of task ambiguity in instructions for Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks. Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and executing a wide range of tasks through natural language interaction, their performance is significantly hindered by the ambiguity present in real-world instructions. To address this, AmbigNLG seeks to identify and mitigate such ambiguities, aiming to refine instructions to match user expectations better. We introduce a dataset, AmbigSNI-NLG, consisting of 2,500 instances, and develop an ambiguity taxonomy for categorizing and annotating instruction ambiguities. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements in text generation quality, highlighting the critical role of clear and specific instructions in enhancing LLM performance in NLG tasks.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Solve Robot Routing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Routing problems are common in mobile robotics, encompassing tasks such as inspection, surveillance, and coverage. Depending on the objective and constraints, these problems often reduce to variants of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), with solutions traditionally derived by translating high-level objectives into an optimization formulation and using modern solvers to arrive at a solution. Here, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to replace the entire pipeline from tasks described in natural language to the generation of robot routes. We systematically investigate the performance of LLMs in robot routing by constructing a dataset with 80 unique robot routing problems across 8 variants in both single and multi-robot settings. We evaluate LLMs through three frameworks: single attempt, self-debugging, and self-debugging with self-verification and various contexts, including mathematical formulations, pseudo-code, and related research papers. Our findings reveal that both self-debugging and self-verification enhance success rates without significantly lowering the optimality gap. We observe context-sensitive behavior - providing mathematical formulations as context decreases the optimality gap but significantly decreases success rates and providing pseudo-code and related research papers as context does not consistently improve success rates or decrease the optimality gap. We identify key challenges and propose future directions to enhance LLM performance in solving robot routing problems.

      <title>Developing Safe and Responsible Large Language Model : Can We Balance Bias Reduction and Language Understanding in Large Language Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01399v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as text generation and translation, among others. However, these models often generate text that can perpetuate biases. Existing approaches to mitigate these biases usually compromise knowledge retention. This study explores whether LLMs can produce safe, unbiased outputs without sacrificing knowledge or comprehension. We introduce the Safe and Responsible Large Language Model (\textbf{SR}$_{\text{LLM}}$), which has been instruction fine-tuned atop an inherently safe fine-tuned LLM to reduce biases in generated texts. We developed a specialized dataset with examples of unsafe and corresponding safe variations to train \textbf{SR}$_{\text{LLM}}$ to identify and correct biased text. Experiments on our specialized dataset and out-of-distribution test sets reveal that \textbf{SR}$_{\text{LLM}}$ effectively reduces biases while preserving knowledge integrity. This performance surpasses that of traditional fine-tuning of smaller language models and base LLMs that merely reply on prompting techniques. Our findings indicate that instruction fine-tuning is an effective strategy for minimizing bias in LLMs while retaining knowledge. The code and dataset are accessible at \href{https://github.com/shainarazavi/Safe-Responsible-LLM}{SR-LLM}.</description>

      <title>PRobELM: Plausibility Ranking Evaluation for Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces PRobELM (Plausibility Ranking Evaluation for Language Models), a benchmark designed to assess language models' ability to discern more plausible from less plausible scenarios through their parametric knowledge. While benchmarks such as TruthfulQA emphasise factual accuracy or truthfulness, and others such as COPA explore plausible scenarios without explicitly incorporating world knowledge, PRobELM seeks to bridge this gap by evaluating models' capabilities to prioritise plausible scenarios that leverage world knowledge over less plausible alternatives. This design allows us to assess the potential of language models for downstream use cases such as literature-based discovery where the focus is on identifying information that is likely but not yet known. Our benchmark is constructed from a dataset curated from Wikidata edit histories, tailored to align the temporal bounds of the training data for the evaluated models. PRobELM facilitates the evaluation of language models across multiple prompting types, including statement, text completion, and question-answering. Experiments with 10 models of various sizes and architectures on the relationship between model scales, training recency, and plausibility performance, reveal that factual accuracy does not directly correlate with plausibility performance and that up-to-date training data enhances plausibility assessment across different model architectures.</description>

      <title>RULER: What's the Real Context Size of Your Long-Context Language Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) test, which examines the ability to retrieve a piece of information (the "needle") from long distractor texts (the "haystack"), has been widely adopted to evaluate long-context language models (LMs). However, this simple retrieval-based test is indicative of only a superficial form of long-context understanding. To provide a more comprehensive evaluation of long-context LMs, we create a new synthetic benchmark RULER with flexible configurations for customized sequence length and task complexity. RULER expands upon the vanilla NIAH test to encompass variations with diverse types and quantities of needles. Moreover, RULER introduces new task categories multi-hop tracing and aggregation to test behaviors beyond searching from context. We evaluate 17 long-context LMs with 13 representative tasks in RULER. Despite achieving nearly perfect accuracy in the vanilla NIAH test, almost all models exhibit large performance drops as the context length increases. While these models all claim context sizes of 32K tokens or greater, only half of them can maintain satisfactory performance at the length of 32K. Our analysis of Yi-34B, which supports context length of 200K, reveals large room for improvement as we increase input length and task complexity. We open source RULER to spur comprehensive evaluation of long-context LMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore on-device self-supervised collaborative fine-tuning of large language models with limited local data availability. Taking inspiration from the collaborative learning community, we introduce three distinct trust-weighted gradient aggregation schemes: weight similarity-based, prediction similarity-based and validation performance-based. To minimize communication overhead, we integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and only exchange LoRA weight updates. Our protocols, driven by prediction and performance metrics, surpass both FedAvg and local fine-tuning methods, which is particularly evident in realistic scenarios with more diverse local data distributions. The results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in addressing heterogeneity and scarcity within local datasets.</description>

      <title>D2PO: Discriminator-Guided DPO with Response Evaluation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Varied approaches for aligning language models have been proposed, including supervised fine-tuning, RLHF, and direct optimization methods such as DPO. Although DPO has rapidly gained popularity due to its straightforward training process and competitive results, there is an open question of whether there remain practical advantages of using a discriminator, like a reward model, to evaluate responses. We propose D2PO, discriminator-guided DPO, an approach for the online setting where preferences are being collected throughout learning. As we collect gold preferences, we use these not only to train our policy, but to train a discriminative response evaluation model to silver-label even more synthetic data for policy training. We explore this approach across a set of diverse tasks, including a realistic chat setting, we find that our approach leads to higher-quality outputs compared to DPO with the same data budget, and greater efficiency in terms of preference data requirements. Furthermore, we show conditions under which silver labeling is most helpful: it is most effective when training the policy with DPO, outperforming traditional PPO, and benefits from maintaining a separate discriminator from the policy model.</description>

      <title>Improving Language Models Trained on Translated Data with Continual Pre-Training and Dictionary Learning Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training LLMs for low-resource languages usually utilizes data augmentation from English using machine translation (MT). This, however, brings a number of challenges to LLM training: there are large costs attached to translating and curating huge amounts of content with high-end machine translation solutions; the translated content carries over cultural biases; and if the translation is not faithful and accurate, data quality degrades causing issues in the trained model. In this work, we investigate the role of translation and synthetic data in training language models. We translate TinyStories, a dataset of 2.2M short stories for 3-4 year old children, from English to Arabic using the open NLLB-3B MT model. We train a number of story generation models of size 1M-33M parameters using this data. We identify a number of quality and task-specific issues in the resulting models. To rectify these issues, we further pre-train the models with a small dataset of synthesized high-quality Arabic stories generated by a capable LLM, representing 1% of the original training data. We show, using GPT-4 as a judge and Dictionary Learning Analysis from mechanistic interpretability, that the suggested approach is a practical means to resolve some of the machine translation pitfalls. We illustrate the improvements through case studies of linguistic and cultural bias issues.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces Filtered Corpus Training, a method that trains language models (LMs) on corpora with certain linguistic constructions filtered out from the training data, and uses it to measure the ability of LMs to perform linguistic generalization on the basis of indirect evidence. We apply the method to both LSTM and Transformer LMs (of roughly comparable size), developing filtered corpora that target a wide range of linguistic phenomena. Our results show that while transformers are better qua LMs (as measured by perplexity), both models perform equally and surprisingly well on linguistic generalization measures, suggesting that they are capable of generalizing from indirect evidence.</description>

Abstract: We release the Nemotron-4 340B model family, including Nemotron-4-340B-Base, Nemotron-4-340B-Instruct, and Nemotron-4-340B-Reward. Our models are open access under the NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement, a permissive model license that allows distribution, modification, and use of the models and its outputs. These models perform competitively to open access models on a wide range of evaluation benchmarks, and were sized to fit on a single DGX H100 with 8 GPUs when deployed in FP8 precision. We believe that the community can benefit from these models in various research studies and commercial applications, especially for generating synthetic data to train smaller language models. Notably, over 98% of data used in our model alignment process is synthetically generated, showcasing the effectiveness of these models in generating synthetic data. To further support open research and facilitate model development, we are also open-sourcing the synthetic data generation pipeline used in our model alignment process.</description>

      <title>PsycoLLM: Enhancing LLM for Psychological Understanding and Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mental health has attracted substantial attention in recent years and LLM can be an effective technology for alleviating this problem owing to its capability in text understanding and dialogue. However, existing research in this domain often suffers from limitations, such as training on datasets lacking crucial prior knowledge and evidence, and the absence of comprehensive evaluation methods. In this paper, we propose a specialized psychological large language model (LLM), named PsycoLLM, trained on a proposed high-quality psychological dataset, including single-turn QA, multi-turn dialogues and knowledge-based QA. Specifically, we construct multi-turn dialogues through a three-step pipeline comprising generation, evidence judgment, and refinement. We augment this process with real-world psychological case backgrounds extracted from online platforms, enhancing the relevance and applicability of the generated data. Additionally, to compare the performance of PsycoLLM with other LLMs, we develop a comprehensive psychological benchmark based on authoritative psychological counseling examinations in China, which includes assessments of professional ethics, theoretical proficiency, and case analysis. The experimental results on the benchmark illustrates the effectiveness of PsycoLLM, which demonstrates superior performance compared to other LLMs.</description>

      <title>PAS: Data-Efficient Plug-and-Play Prompt Augmentation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06027v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred a growing demand for plug-and-play AI systems. Among the various AI techniques, prompt engineering stands out as particularly significant. However, users often face challenges in writing prompts due to the steep learning curve and significant time investment, and existing automatic prompt engineering (APE) models can be difficult to use. To address this issue, we propose PAS, an LLM-based plug-and-play APE system. PAS utilizes LLMs trained on high-quality, automatically generated prompt complementary datasets, resulting in exceptional performance. In comprehensive benchmarks, PAS achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results compared to previous APE models, with an average improvement of 6.09 points. Moreover, PAS is highly efficient, achieving SoTA performance with only 9000 data points. Additionally, PAS can autonomously generate prompt augmentation data without requiring additional human labor. Its flexibility also allows it to be compatible with all existing LLMs and applicable to a wide range of tasks. PAS excels in human evaluations, underscoring its suitability as a plug-in for users. This combination of high performance, efficiency, and flexibility makes PAS a valuable system for enhancing the usability and effectiveness of LLMs through improved prompt engineering.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit bias in a variety of ways. Such biases can create or exacerbate unfair outcomes for certain groups within a protected attribute, including, but not limited to sex, race, sexual orientation, or age. This paper aims to provide a technical guide for practitioners to assess bias and fairness risks in LLM use cases. The main contribution of this work is a decision framework that allows practitioners to determine which metrics to use for a specific LLM use case. To achieve this, this study categorizes LLM bias and fairness risks, maps those risks to a taxonomy of LLM use cases, and then formally defines various metrics to assess each type of risk. As part of this work, several new bias and fairness metrics are introduced, including innovative counterfactual metrics as well as metrics based on stereotype classifiers. Instead of focusing solely on the model itself, the sensitivity of both prompt-risk and model-risk are taken into account by defining evaluations at the level of an LLM use case, characterized by a model and a population of prompts. Furthermore, because all of the evaluation metrics are calculated solely using the LLM output, the proposed framework is highly practical and easily actionable for practitioners.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Language Group-Based MoE: Enhancing Code-Switching Speech Recognition with Hierarchical Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach is well-suited for multilingual and code-switching (CS) tasks due to its multi-expert architecture. This work introduces the DLG-MoE, a Dynamic Language Group-based MoE optimized for bilingual and CS scenarios. DLG-MoE operates based on a hierarchical routing mechanism. First, the language router explicitly models the language and dispatches the representations to the corresponding language expert groups. Subsequently, the unsupervised router within each language group implicitly models attributes beyond language, and coordinates expert routing and collaboration. The model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while also having unparalleled flexibility. It supports different top-k inference and streaming capabilities, and can also prune the model parameters to obtain a monolingual sub-model. The Code will be released.</description>

Abstract: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), suicide was the fourth leading cause of death in the world for individuals aged 15 to 29 in 2019. Given the rapid increase in mental health issues, providing psychological support is both crucial and urgent. In this paper: (1) we propose S\'olo Esc\'uchame, the first open-source Spanish emotional assistance chatbot, based on LLaMA-2-7b-Chat. (2) We introduced the HEAR (Hispanic Emotional Accompaniment Responses) dataset, compiled from multiple English sources translated into Spanish, as well as generic data generated using ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo. Finally, (3) we propose an evaluation metric based on two semi-automatic assessment methods. Our system outperforms a range of state-of-the-art models in providing psychological assistance in Spanish. Our models and datasets are publicly available to facilitate reproducibility.</description>

      <title>StructEval: Deepen and Broaden Large Language Model Assessment via Structured Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluation is the baton for the development of large language models. Current evaluations typically employ a single-item assessment paradigm for each atomic test objective, which struggles to discern whether a model genuinely possesses the required capabilities or merely memorizes/guesses the answers to specific questions. To this end, we propose a novel evaluation framework referred to as StructEval. Starting from an atomic test objective, StructEval deepens and broadens the evaluation by conducting a structured assessment across multiple cognitive levels and critical concepts, and therefore offers a comprehensive, robust and consistent evaluation for LLMs. Experiments on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that StructEval serves as a reliable tool for resisting the risk of data contamination and reducing the interference of potential biases, thereby providing more reliable and consistent conclusions regarding model capabilities. Our framework also sheds light on the design of future principled and trustworthy LLM evaluation protocols.</description>

      <title>New Job, New Gender? Measuring the Social Bias in Image Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00763</link>

Abstract: Image generation models can generate or edit images from a given text. Recent advancements in image generation technology, exemplified by DALL-E and Midjourney, have been groundbreaking. These advanced models, despite their impressive capabilities, are often trained on massive Internet datasets, making them susceptible to generating content that perpetuates social stereotypes and biases, which can lead to severe consequences. Prior research on assessing bias within image generation models suffers from several shortcomings, including limited accuracy, reliance on extensive human labor, and lack of comprehensive analysis. In this paper, we propose BiasPainter, a novel evaluation framework that can accurately, automatically and comprehensively trigger social bias in image generation models. BiasPainter uses a diverse range of seed images of individuals and prompts the image generation models to edit these images using gender, race, and age-neutral queries. These queries span 62 professions, 39 activities, 57 types of objects, and 70 personality traits. The framework then compares the edited images to the original seed images, focusing on the significant changes related to gender, race, and age. BiasPainter adopts a key insight that these characteristics should not be modified when subjected to neutral prompts. Built upon this design, BiasPainter can trigger the social bias and evaluate the fairness of image generation models. We use BiasPainter to evaluate six widely-used image generation models, such as stable diffusion and Midjourney. Experimental results show that BiasPainter can successfully trigger social bias in image generation models. According to our human evaluation, BiasPainter can achieve 90.8% accuracy on automatic bias detection, which is significantly higher than the results reported in previous work.</description>

      <title>CodeUltraFeedback: An LLM-as-a-Judge Dataset for Aligning Large Language Models to Coding Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with user-defined coding preferences is a challenging endeavour that requires a deep assessment of LLMs' outputs. Existing methods and benchmarks rely primarily on automated metrics and static analysis tools, which often fail to capture the nuances of user instructions and LLM outputs. To address this gap, we propose using the LLM-as-a-Judge methodology to evaluate the alignment of LLMs with coding preferences. Based on this approach, we present CodeUltraFeedback, a comprehensive dataset designed to facilitate the evaluation and improvement of LLM alignment. CodeUltraFeedback consists of 10,000 coding instructions, each annotated with four responses generated from a diverse pool of 14 LLMs. These responses are ranked based on five distinct coding preferences using GPT-3.5 as a judge, providing both numerical scores and detailed textual feedback. Our analysis of CodeUltraFeedback reveals that responses from GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are generally preferred over those from open-weight LLMs, highlighting significant differences in alignment between closed and open-weight models. In turn, we explore the usage of CodeUltraFeedback as feedback data to fine-tune and align CodeLlama-7B-Instruct using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) with direct preference optimization (DPO). The resulting aligned CodeLlama-7B-Instruct model outperforms larger LLMs in terms of alignment with coding preferences and shows improved functional correctness on the HumanEval+ benchmark compared to the original instruct model. Therefore, our contributions bridge the gap in preference tuning of LLMs for code and set the stage for further advancements in model alignment and RLAIF in automated software engineering.</description>

      <title>Prompt Public Large Language Models to Synthesize Data for Private On-device Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-training on public data is an effective method to improve the performance for federated learning (FL) with differential privacy (DP). This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) trained on public data can improve the quality of pre-training data for the on-device language models trained with DP and FL. We carefully design LLM prompts to filter and transform existing public data, and generate new data to resemble the real user data distribution. The model pre-trained on our synthetic dataset achieves relative improvement of 19.0% and 22.8% in next word prediction accuracy compared to the baseline model pre-trained on a standard public dataset, when evaluated over the real user data in Gboard (Google Keyboard, a production mobile keyboard application). Furthermore, our method achieves evaluation accuracy better than or comparable to the baseline during the DP FL fine-tuning over millions of mobile devices, and our final model outperforms the baseline in production A/B testing. Our experiments demonstrate the strengths of LLMs in synthesizing data close to the private distribution even without accessing the private data, and also suggest future research directions to further reduce the distribution gap.</description>

      <title>VisEval: A Benchmark for Data Visualization in the Era of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Translating natural language to visualization (NL2VIS) has shown great promise for visual data analysis, but it remains a challenging task that requires multiple low-level implementations, such as natural language processing and visualization design. Recent advancements in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are opening new avenues for generating visualizations from natural language. However, the lack of a comprehensive and reliable benchmark hinders our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in visualization generation. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a new NL2VIS benchmark called VisEval. Firstly, we introduce a high-quality and large-scale dataset. This dataset includes 2,524 representative queries covering 146 databases, paired with accurately labeled ground truths. Secondly, we advocate for a comprehensive automated evaluation methodology covering multiple dimensions, including validity, legality, and readability. By systematically scanning for potential issues with a number of heterogeneous checkers, VisEval provides reliable and trustworthy evaluation outcomes. We run VisEval on a series of state-of-the-art LLMs. Our evaluation reveals prevalent challenges and delivers essential insights for future advancements.</description>

      <title>Stay Tuned: An Empirical Study of the Impact of Hyperparameters on LLM Tuning in Real-World Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is an effective method to enhance their performance on downstream tasks. However, choosing the appropriate setting of tuning hyperparameters (HPs) is a labor-intensive and computationally expensive process. Here, we provide recommended HP configurations for practical use-cases that represent a better starting point for practitioners, when considering two SOTA LLMs and two commonly used tuning methods. We describe Coverage-based Search (CBS), a process for ranking HP configurations based on an offline extensive grid search, such that the top ranked configurations collectively provide a practical robust recommendation for a wide range of datasets and domains. We focus our experiments on Llama-3-8B and Mistral-7B, as well as full fine-tuning and LoRa, conducting a total of &gt; 10,000 tuning experiments. Our results suggest that, in general, Llama-3-8B and LoRA should be preferred, when possible. Moreover, we show that for both models and tuning methods, exploring only a few HP configurations, as recommended by our analysis, can provide excellent results in practice, making this work a valuable resource for practitioners.</description>

      <title>SentenceVAE: Enable Next-sentence Prediction for Large Language Models with Faster Speed, Higher Accuracy and Longer Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00655v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) primarily utilize next-token prediction method for inference, which significantly impedes their processing speed. In this paper, we introduce a novel inference methodology termed next-sentence prediction, aimed at enhancing the inference efficiency of LLMs. We present Sentence Variational Autoencoder (SentenceVAE), a tiny model consisting of a Sentence Encoder and a Sentence Decoder. The Sentence Encoder can effectively condense the information within a sentence into a singular token, while the Sentence Decoder can reconstruct this compressed token back into sentence. By integrating SentenceVAE into the input and output layers of LLMs, we develop Sentence-level LLMs (SLLMs) that employ a sentence-by-sentence inference method. In addition, the SentenceVAE module of SLLMS can maintain the integrity of the original semantic content by segmenting the context into sentences, thereby improving accuracy while boosting inference speed. Moreover, compared to previous LLMs, SLLMs process fewer tokens over equivalent context length, significantly reducing memory demands for self-attention computation and facilitating the handling of longer context. Extensive experiments on Wanjuan dataset have reveal that the proposed method can accelerate inference speed by 204~365%, reduce perplexity (PPL) to 46~75% of its original metric, and decrease memory overhead by 86~91% for the equivalent context length, compared to the token-by-token method.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Power of Data Tsunami: A Comprehensive Survey on Data Assessment and Selection for Instruction Tuning of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruction tuning plays a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Despite the vast amount of open instruction datasets, naively training a LLM on all existing instructions may not be optimal and practical. To pinpoint the most beneficial datapoints, data assessment and selection methods have been proposed in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. However, under the context of instruction tuning, there still exists a gap in knowledge on what kind of data evaluation metrics can be employed and how they can be integrated into the selection mechanism. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive review on existing literature of data assessment and selection especially for instruction tuning of LLMs. We systematically categorize all applicable methods into quality-based, diversity-based, and importance-based ones where a unified, fine-grained taxonomy is structured. For each category, representative methods are elaborated to describe the landscape of relevant research. In addition, comparison between latest methods is conducted on their officially reported results to provide in-depth discussions on their limitations. Finally, we summarize the open challenges and propose the promosing avenues for future studies.
